## Experiments with highest-disambiguating nodes (HDNs)

I limit to words that have only one sense in all parts-of-speech so that we
don't need to POS-tag the corpus.

I ignore proper names because they might refer to different entities than what
are in WordNet and can be embedded as part of other names (see
screenshot below).
