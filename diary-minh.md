Wrote a script to convert Gigaword to bare sentences and tokenize them.

Wrote another script to train Word2vec on the resulting file.

I think copying the file to a SSD and run the training script from there would improve speed.
It did. Running on regular disk, the program can only use 200-300% CPU (i.e. the equivalent of
2-3 CPUs running 100%) but with this trick, it can reach 3000%.

```

Started my script for running for 12 hours. If that's not enough, we need to ask for a dedicated server.
