" I do n't renounce presenting my candidature and gathering the necessary support  to be the next head of the regional government . "
Opinion polls before the election had shown a rise in support for the Basque  Socialists , which analysts had attributed to Zapatero 's bid to negotiate peace  with the armed separatist group ETA , blamed for the deaths of 825 people in its  40-year campaign for an independent Basque homeland .
The tentative peace process collapsed when the group killed two people in a bomb  attack at Madrid airport in December 2006 .
Spain 's Supreme Court last month banned two pro - independence parties from  participating in Sunday 's election due to their links to ETA and its outlawed  political wing Batasuna .
Some four million people were eligible to vote to elect regional parliaments in  the Basque and Galicia regions in what were the first elections since Zapatero  was returned to power one year ago for a second four - year term .
Since then , the global financial crisis has accelerated the collapse of Spain 's  property market after a decade - long boom , pushing the country into recession  late last year .
The unemployment rate soared to 13.9 percent in the last quarter of 2008 , the  highest in the 27-nation European Union .
In Sunday 's polls , Zapatero was seeking to gauge the degree of support for his  measures to tackle the crisis , which include an 11-billion - euro ( 14-billion-  dollar ) infrastructure plan to create over 300,000 jobs .
Spain 's ruling Socialists were ousted from power in Galicia and trailed the  incumbent party in the Basque Country in regional elections on Sunday seen as  the first test of voter sentiment since the country plunged into recession .
In northwestern Galicia , the Socialist leader of the regional government , Emilio  Perez Torino , conceded defeat to the conservative opposition Popular Party ,  which won a majority of 39 seats in the 75-seat regional assembly .
