Have you permitted it to become a giveaway---giveaway%1:21:00:: program---program%1:09:01:: rather than one that has the goal---goal%1:09:00:: of improved employee---employee%1:18:00:: morale---morale%1:26:00:: and , consequently , increased productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: ?

When negotiating with your union---union%1:14:01:: , do you make sure employees---employee%1:18:00:: have a choice---choice%1:04:00:: between new benefits---benefit%1:21:00:: and their cents---cent%1:23:00:: per hour---hour%1:28:00:: cost---cost%1:21:00:: in wages---wage%1:21:00:: .

Are you careful to restrict the number---number%1:07:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: on leave at one time so that your total employment---employment%1:04:02:: obligation---obligation%1:26:00:: is minimized ?
Have you considered using vending---vending%1:04:00:: equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: to replace or reduce the number---number%1:07:00:: of cafeteria---cafeteria%1:06:00:: employees---employee%1:18:00:: ?
What are the possibilities---possibility%1:09:03:: for operating your cafeteria---cafeteria%1:06:00:: for a single shift---shift%1:28:00:: only and relying upon vending machines---vending_machine%1:06:00:: or prepackaged sandwiches---sandwich%1:13:00:: for the second - and third shift---shift%1:28:00:: operations---operation%1:04:06:: ?

Can staggered lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: periods---period%1:28:00:: relieve the capacity---capacity%1:23:00:: strain---strain%1:19:00:: on your feeding---feeding%1:04:01:: facilities---facility%1:06:00:: ?

Would a camera---camera%1:06:00:: club---club%1:14:00:: be useful in taking pictures---picture%1:06:00:: pertinent to plant---plant%1:06:01:: safety---safety%1:26:00:: ?
Are you spending---spending%1:04:00:: too much money---money%1:21:00:: on team---team%1:14:00:: uniforms---uniform%1:06:00:: that benefit only a few employees---employee%1:18:00:: ?
Are you underwriting expensive team---team%1:14:00:: trips---trip%1:04:00:: ?

Do you know the trend---trend%1:15:01:: in your cost---cost%1:21:00:: of maintaining access roads---access_road%1:06:00:: and parking lots---parking_lot%1:15:00:: ?

If you use company---company%1:14:01:: transportation---transportation%1:06:00:: to meet trains---train%1:06:00:: or to haul visitors---visitor%1:18:00:: , would taxis---taxi%1:06:00:: be cheaper ?

Which is more economical for your plant---plant%1:06:01:: - a vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: shutdown---shutdown%1:04:00:: or spaced vacations---vacation%1:28:00:: that require extra employees---employee%1:18:00:: for vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: fill-ins---fill-in%1:18:00:: ?
Can vacations---vacation%1:28:00:: be spaced throughout the 12 months---month%1:28:01:: to minimize the number---number%1:07:00:: of employee---employee%1:18:00:: fill-ins---fill-in%1:18:00:: ?
Do you insist that unneeded salary---salary%1:21:00:: employees---employee%1:18:00:: take their vacations---vacation%1:28:00:: during plant---plant%1:06:01:: shutdowns---shutdown%1:04:00:: ?
What can your sales---sale%1:04:02:: and purchasing departments---purchasing_department%1:14:00:: do to curtail orders---order%1:10:01:: , shipments---shipment%1:04:00:: , and receipts---receipt%1:04:00:: during vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: shutdown---shutdown%1:04:00:: periods---period%1:28:00:: ?
Is an arbitrary retirement---retirement%1:26:00:: age---age%1:07:00:: of 65 actually costing your plant---plant%1:06:01:: money---money%1:21:00:: ?
What sort---sort%1:09:00:: of effort---effort%1:04:00:: do you make to assure that older or disabled workers---worker%1:18:00:: are fully productive ?
Would early retirement---retirement%1:26:00:: of non-productive , disabled employees---employee%1:18:00:: reduce the number---number%1:07:00:: of make-work---make-work%1:04:00:: jobs---job%1:04:00:: ?
Will your union---union%1:14:01:: accept seniority---seniority%1:26:00:: concessions---concession%1:10:00:: in assigning work---work%1:04:00:: for older or disabled employees---employee%1:18:00:: ?
Can you share medical facilities---facility%1:06:00:: and staff---staff%1:14:01:: with neighboring plants---plant%1:06:01:: ?
If you have a full-time doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: now , can he be replaced with a part-time doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: or one who serves on a fee---fee%1:21:00:: per case---case%1:18:03:: basis---basis%1:24:00:: only ?
Can your plant---plant%1:06:01:: nurse---nurse%1:18:00:: be replaced by a trained first-aid---first_aid%1:04:00:: man---man%1:18:04:: who works full-time on some other assignment---assignment%1:04:00:: ?
Do you rigidly distinguish between job---job%1:04:00:: - and non job---job%1:04:00:: connected health problems---health_problem%1:26:00:: and avoid treating the latter ?
Are you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical services---services%1:04:00:: - flu---flu%1:26:00:: shots---shot%1:04:03:: , sun---sun%1:19:00:: lamp---lamp%1:06:00:: treatments---treatment%1:04:00:: , etc. ?
If you have an annual or regular physical examination---examination%1:04:00:: program---program%1:09:01:: , is it worth what it is costing you ?
Consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals---goal%1:09:00:: are before setting up or revamping your employee---employee%1:18:00:: benefit---benefit%1:21:00:: program---program%1:09:01:: .
Too many plant---plant%1:06:01:: officials---official%1:18:01:: are all too eager to buy a package---package%1:06:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: from an insurance company---insurance_company%1:14:00:: simply because it works for another plant---plant%1:06:01:: .
But even if that other plant---plant%1:06:01:: employs the same number---number%1:23:00:: of workers---worker%1:18:00:: and makes the same product---product%1:06:00:: , there are other facts---fact%1:09:01:: to consider .
How old is your working force---force%1:14:00:: ?
What 's your profit margin---profit_margin%1:21:00:: ?
In what section---section%1:15:01:: of the country---country%1:15:00:: are you located ?
Are you in a rural or urban area---urban_area%1:15:00:: ?
These factors---factor%1:11:00:: can make the difference---difference%1:07:00:: between waste---waste%1:04:00:: and efficiency---efficiency%1:09:00:: in any benefit---benefit%1:21:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: .
Above all , do n't set up extravagant fringe benefits---fringe_benefit%1:21:00:: just to buy employee---employee%1:18:00:: good will---good_will%1:07:00:: .
Unions---union%1:14:01:: stress fringe benefits---fringe_benefit%1:21:00:: , but the individual hourly worker---worker%1:18:00:: prefers cash---cash%1:21:00:: every time---time%1:11:00:: .
Aim to balance your employee---employee%1:18:00:: benefit---benefit%1:21:00:: package---package%1:14:00:: .
Some plants---plant%1:06:01:: go overboard on one type---type%1:09:00:: of fringe---fringe%1:25:00:: - say a liberal retirement---retirement%1:26:00:: plan---plan%1:09:00:: - and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere .
They 're asking for union---union%1:14:01:: trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: .
If you want credit---credit%1:10:00:: for your employee---employee%1:18:00:: services---services%1:04:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: , let your workers---worker%1:18:00:: know what they 're entitled to .
Encourage them to exercise their benefits---benefit%1:07:00:: .
This can be done by stories---story%1:10:03:: in your house organs---house_organ%1:10:00:: , posters---poster%1:10:00:: , special publications---publication%1:10:00:: , letters---letter%1:10:00:: to workers---worker%1:18:00:: ' homes---home%1:15:04:: as well as by word of mouth through your chain---chain%1:14:00:: of command---command%1:07:00:: .
Some companies---company%1:14:01:: find a little imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: helpful .
Hallmark Cards , Inc.---group%1:03:00:: , Kansas City---kansas_city%1:15:00:: , Mo.---missouri%1:15:00:: , has a do-it-yourself quiz---quiz%1:10:00:: game---game%1:04:00:: called `` Benefit Bafflers '' , which it distributes to employees---employee%1:18:00:: .
M + R Dietetic Laboratories , Inc.---group%1:03:00:: , Columbus---columbus%1:15:00:: , gives all its workers---worker%1:18:00:: a facsimile---facsimile%1:06:01:: checkbook---checkbook%1:21:00:: - each check---check%1:21:00:: showing the amount---amount%1:21:00:: the company---company%1:14:01:: spends on a particular fringe---fringe%1:25:00:: .
U. S. Rubber Company---group%1:03:00:: , New York---new_york%1:15:01:: , passes out a form---form%1:10:01:: itemizing the value---value%1:21:00:: of benefits---benefit%1:21:00:: .
The blue-collar worker---worker%1:18:00:: thus knows his insurance---insurance%1:21:02:: package---package%1:14:00:: , for example , costs $ 227.72 .
Have the insurance company---insurance_company%1:14:00:: or your own accounting---accounting%1:04:00:: department---department%1:14:00:: break down the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of your insurance---insurance%1:21:02:: package---package%1:14:00:: periodically .
You may find certain coverage---coverage%1:21:00:: costing much more than is economically feasible , thereby alerting you to desirable revisions---revision%1:10:01:: .
Check to see if some of your benefits---benefit%1:21:00:: - such as on-the-job disability---disability%1:26:00:: pay---pay%1:21:01:: - can be put on a direct payment---payment%1:04:00:: rather than an insured basis---basis%1:24:00:: at a savings---saving%1:04:00:: to you .
Use deductable insurance---insurance%1:21:02:: wherever feasible .
It can put an end---end%1:26:00:: to marginal claims---claim%1:04:00:: which play havoc---havoc%1:04:00:: with your insurance---insurance%1:21:02:: rates---rate%1:21:00:: .
Also , beware of open end policies---policy%1:10:02:: , especially in the medical field---field%1:09:00:: .
This will mean that every time---time%1:11:00:: there 's an increase---increase%1:11:00:: in hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: rates---rate%1:21:00:: your cost---cost%1:21:00:: will go up in like manner---manner%1:07:02:: .
Put a dollar---dollar%1:23:00:: and cents---cent%1:23:00:: limit---limit%1:07:00:: on benefits---benefit%1:21:00:: .
Do n't go overboard on insurance---insurance%1:10:00:: that pays benefits---benefit%1:21:00:: only upon death---death%1:11:00:: .
Generally , your employee---employee%1:18:00:: will greatly appreciate benefits---benefit%1:21:00:: that protect him during his working life---life%1:26:02:: or during retirement---retirement%1:26:00:: .
In granting bereavement---bereavement%1:26:00:: leaves---leave%1:28:00:: , specify the maximum time off---time_off%1:28:00:: and list what the worker---worker%1:18:00:: 's relation---relation%1:03:00:: to the deceased---deceased%1:18:00:: must be to qualify .
Thus , you avoid headaches---headache%1:09:00:: when an employee---employee%1:18:00:: wants off for his fourth cousin---cousin%1:18:00:: 's funeral---funeral%1:11:00:: .
Also , reserve the right---right%1:07:00:: to demand proof---proof%1:09:00:: of death---death%1:26:00:: despite the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that you 'll probably never use it .
Coffee breaks---coffee_break%1:13:00:: can be a real headache---headache%1:09:00:: if not regulated .
Vending machines---vending_machine%1:06:00:: can alleviate the long hike---hike%1:04:00:: to the cafeteria---cafeteria%1:06:00:: during the break---break%1:04:05:: with resulting waste---waste%1:04:00:: of production---production%1:04:00:: time---time%1:11:00:: .
If coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: is sold at the cafeteria---cafeteria%1:06:00:: , let a few workers---worker%1:18:00:: in each department---department%1:14:00:: get it for the whole group---group%1:03:00:: .
Consider installing supplemental serving lines---line%1:14:01:: in production---production%1:04:00:: areas---area%1:06:00:: .
Make sure milk---milk%1:13:01:: for the coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: is placed in dispensers---dispenser%1:06:00:: rather than in containers---container%1:06:00:: , if you are supplying the coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: .
Otherwise , you may be saddled with a good size milk---milk%1:13:01:: bill---bill%1:10:01:: by milk---milk%1:13:01:: drinkers---drinker%1:18:01:: .
Keep the retirement---retirement%1:26:00:: age---age%1:07:00:: flexible so skilled craftsmen---craftsman%1:18:00:: such as tool---tool%1:06:00:: and die---die%1:06:01:: makers---maker%1:18:00:: can be kept on the job for the convenience---convenience%1:26:00:: of the company---company%1:14:01:: .
And so deadheads---deadhead%1:18:00:: on the payroll---payroll%1:21:00:: can be eased out at the earliest possible age---age%1:07:00:: .
Make sure you have minimum age---age%1:07:00:: and time---time%1:28:00:: on the job requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: tied into your pension---pension%1:21:00:: plan---plan%1:09:00:: .
Younger men---men%1:14:00:: usually do n't think of pensions---pension%1:21:00:: as an important job---job%1:04:00:: benefit---benefit%1:21:00:: factor---factor%1:09:00:: anyhow and they 're liable to change jobs---job%1:04:00:: several times---time%1:11:00:: before settling down .
Choose carefully between contributory or non contributory pension---pension%1:21:00:: plans---plan%1:09:00:: .
There are two sides---side%1:15:00:: of a coin---coin%1:21:02:: for this decision---decision%1:04:00:: .
Workers---worker%1:18:00:: usually think more of a plan---plan%1:09:00:: they contribute to .
And they can at least collect the money---money%1:21:00:: they put in , plus interest---interest%1:21:00:: , when they leave the company---company%1:14:01:: .
A non contributory plan---plan%1:09:00:: usually won n't pay off for the worker---worker%1:18:00:: until he retires .
Thus , there is an added incentive---incentive%1:16:00:: to stay on the job .
Make sure you do n't pay for holidays---holiday%1:28:00:: that occur when an employee---employee%1:18:00:: would not otherwise be working .
leaves of absences---leave_of_absence%1:28:00:: , illnesses---illness%1:26:00:: , and layoffs---layoff%1:04:00:: .
Consider adopting a system---system%1:14:00:: of holidays---holiday%1:28:00:: in which time off---time_off%1:28:00:: is granted with an eye---eye%1:09:00:: to minimum inconvenience to the operation---operation%1:26:00:: of the plant---plant%1:06:01:: .
It 's usually not too hard to sell workers---worker%1:18:00:: on this as it gives them longer holiday---holiday%1:28:00:: periods---period%1:28:00:: .
For example , the Friday---friday%1:28:00:: after Thanksgiving---thanksgiving%1:28:00:: can be substituted for Washington---washington%1:18:00:: 's birthday---birthday%1:28:00:: .
This reduces the number---number%1:07:00:: of expensive plant---plant%1:06:01:: shutdowns---shutdown%1:04:00:: and startups---startup%1:04:01:: .
Require each employee---employee%1:18:00:: to work his last shift---shift%1:28:00:: both before and after the holiday---holiday%1:28:00:: to be eligible for pay---pay%1:21:01:: .
This cuts the absentee rate---absentee_rate%1:24:00:: .
Consider using vending machines---vending_machine%1:06:00:: rather than subsidized cafeterias---cafeteria%1:06:00:: .
Latest models---model%1:09:03:: serve hot meals---meal%1:13:00:: at reasonable prices---price%1:07:00:: , and at a profit---profit%1:07:00:: to you .
If a concessionaire---concessionaire%1:18:00:: runs the cafeteria---cafeteria%1:06:00:: , keep an eye out for quality---quality%1:07:02:: and price---price%1:07:00:: .
If the soup---soup%1:13:00:: tastes like dishwater---dishwater%1:27:00:: , your employees---employee%1:18:00:: won n't blame the concessionaire---concessionaire%1:18:00:: .
You 'll take the rap---rap%1:10:00:: .
Check your cafeteria---cafeteria%1:06:00:: location---location%1:03:00:: to make sure it 's convenient for most employees---employee%1:18:00:: .
You may save valuable production---production%1:04:00:: minutes---minute%1:28:00:: with a change---change%1:11:00:: .
Spread your vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: over the widest possible span---span%1:07:00:: of time---time%1:03:00:: or shut the plant---plant%1:06:01:: down for two weeks---two_weeks%1:28:00:: .
This will cut the expense---expense%1:21:00:: of vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: replacements---replacement%1:18:02:: .
And with the shutdown---shutdown%1:04:00:: method---method%1:09:00:: there will be no argument---argument%1:10:03:: as to who gets the choice vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: dates---date%1:28:00:: .
Also make sure you have reasonable requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: as to hours---hours%1:28:00:: worked before a production---production%1:04:00:: employee---employee%1:18:00:: is entitled to a vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: .
You might try providing standard vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: time off---time_off%1:28:00:: but make the vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: pay---pay%1:21:01:: depend on the number---number%1:07:00:: of hours---hours%1:28:00:: worked in the previous year---year%1:28:01:: .
`` Through a door---door%1:06:00:: conveniently unlocked '' , Madden---person%1:03:00:: supplemented .
`` That damn door---door%1:06:00:: '' , said the police chief---police_chief%1:18:00:: .
`` A gift horse---gift_horse%1:21:00:: to be viewed with suspicion---suspicion%1:09:00:: '' .
Madden---person%1:03:00:: 's dark face---face%1:08:00:: wore a meditative look---look%1:07:01:: .
`` If there was collusion---collusion%1:09:00:: between an outside murderer---murderer%1:18:00:: and a member---member%1:18:00:: of the household---household%1:14:00:: it would be an elementary precaution---precaution%1:04:00:: to check on the door---door%1:06:00:: later .
And it makes a very poor red herring---red_herring%1:04:00:: for an inside job---inside_job%1:04:00:: .
Much better to break a cellar---cellar%1:06:00:: window---window%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Do n't forget , there was the hope---hope%1:09:00:: it would pass for a natural death---death%1:19:00:: '' , Pauling---person%1:03:00:: reminded him .
`` Well , with a house---house%1:06:00:: as big as that there must be at least one---one%1:09:00:: cellar---cellar%1:06:00:: window---window%1:06:00:: that would n't be noticed right away unless there was a police investigation---police_investigation%1:04:00:: '' .
And a pane of glass---pane_of_glass%1:06:00:: is n't hard to '' -
The telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: interrupted him .
He scooped up the receiver---receiver%1:06:01:: and said , `` Police chief---police_chief%1:18:00:: '' , into the mouthpiece---mouthpiece%1:06:02:: , and then , `` Oh yes , Mr. Benson---person%1:03:00:: .
With his free hand---hand%1:08:00:: he pulled a pad---pad%1:27:01:: and pencil---pencil%1:06:00:: toward him and began to make notes---note%1:10:00:: as he listened , saying , `` Uh-huh '' and `` I see '' at intervals---interval%1:28:00:: .
At last he said , `` Well , thank you---thank_you%1:10:00:: for calling , Mr. Benson---person%1:03:00:: .
Although there was no doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: in my mind---mind%1:09:00:: and we 've been handling it as one I 'm glad to have it made official '' .
`` Coroner---coroner%1:18:00:: '' , he said to Madden---person%1:03:00:: .
`` He 's just heard from the pathologist---pathologist%1:18:00:: who says Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: apparently died from suffocation---suffocation%1:04:00:: '' .
Pauling---person%1:03:00:: looked at his notes---note%1:10:00:: .
`` Many minute hemorrhages---hemorrhage%1:26:00:: in the lungs---lung%1:08:00:: ; particles---particle%1:27:01:: of lint---lint%1:27:02:: and thread---thread%1:06:00:: in the mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: and nostrils .
Scrapings---scraping%1:17:00:: from the bed linen---bed_linen%1:06:00:: identical with the lint---lint%1:27:02:: and thread---thread%1:06:00:: found in the nasal---nasal_cavity%1:08:00:: and oral cavities---oral_cavity%1:08:00:: .
No other cause---cause%1:11:00:: of death apparent .
No other cause---cause%1:03:00:: of death---death%1:19:00:: apparent .

Brain---brain%1:08:00:: examined for thrombosis---thrombosis%1:26:00:: , clot---clot%1:08:00:: or hemorrhage---hemorrhage%1:26:00:: .
No signs---sign%1:26:00:: of these , no gross hemorrhage---hemorrhage%1:26:00:: of lungs---lung%1:08:00:: , heart---heart%1:08:00:: , brain---brain%1:08:00:: or stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: '' .
Oh , the time---time%1:28:03:: of death---death%1:19:00:: .
The duration---duration%1:28:02:: of the digestive process varies , the pathologist---pathologist%1:18:00:: says , but the empty stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: and the findings---finding%1:17:00:: in the upper gastrointestinal tract---tract%1:08:01:: indicate that Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: died several hours---hour%1:28:00:: after her seven---seven%1:23:00:: o ' clock dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: .
Probably around midnight---midnight%1:28:00:: , give or take an hour---hour%1:28:00:: either way---way%1:15:00:: '' .
Pauling---person%1:03:00:: paused again .
`` Not your problem---problem%1:26:00:: , of course , unless Johnston---person%1:03:00:: and the murderer---murderer%1:18:00:: are one and the same '' .
They discussed this possibility---possibility%1:09:00:: .
However likely it was , Pauling---person%1:03:00:: said , he could n't limit himself to it .
He had to look for other prospects---prospect%1:18:00:: , other motives---motive%1:03:00:: until more conclusive evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: pointing to Johnston---person%1:03:00:: came to light---light%1:09:02:: .
Madden---person%1:03:00:: , with his investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: centered on the fraud---fraud%1:04:00:: , said that tomorrow he would go to the Bronx bank---bank%1:14:00:: through which Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: 's checks---check%1:21:00:: to Johnston---person%1:03:00:: had cleared .
Arthur Williams---person%1:03:00:: had to be located , they agreed .
He might have been in collusion---collusion%1:09:00:: with Johnston---person%1:03:00:: on the fraud---fraud%1:04:00:: ; he might be Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: 's murderer---murderer%1:18:00:: or have played some part---part%1:04:01:: in her death---death%1:19:00:: .
This was Madden---person%1:03:00:: 's suggestion---suggestion%1:09:00:: ; the police chief---police_chief%1:18:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: over it .
If Arthur Williams---person%1:03:00:: was involved in the fraud---fraud%1:04:00:: or the murder---murder%1:04:00:: , then he too had another identity---identity%1:07:00:: .
No one the Medfield---location%1:03:00:: police---police%1:14:00:: had questioned professed to know any more about him than about Johnston---person%1:03:00:: .
Scholarship---scholarship%1:21:00:: applicant---applicant%1:18:00:: ?
Pauling---person%1:03:00:: looked doubtful .
Madden---person%1:03:00:: explained that he was thinking of an application---application%1:10:00:: sent directly to Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: .
Then he asked to use the phone---phone%1:06:00:: and called Brian Thayer---person%1:03:00:: , who said that he was just leaving to keep a lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: date---date%1:14:00:: but would be home by two---two%1:23:00:: o ' clock .
Madden---person%1:03:00:: said that he would see him at two---two%1:23:00:: and made another call---call%1:10:01:: , this one to Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: 's lawyers---lawyer%1:18:00:: .
Mr. Hohlbein---person%1:03:00:: was out for the day---day%1:28:04:: , but Mr. Garth---person%1:03:00:: would be free at one-thirty .
The secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: 's tone---tone%1:10:01:: indicated that an appointment---appointment%1:14:00:: at such short notice---notice%1:10:01:: was a concession---concession%1:10:02:: for which Madden---person%1:03:00:: should be duly grateful .
He inferred that Hohlbein---person%1:03:00:: and Garth---person%1:03:00:: were high-priced lawyers---lawyer%1:18:00:: .
He had lunch with Pauling---person%1:03:00:: .
Promptly at one-thirty he entered Hohlbein---person%1:03:00:: and Garth---person%1:03:00:: 's elegant suite---suite%1:06:00:: of offices---office%1:06:00:: in Medfield---person%1:03:00:: 's newest professional building---building%1:06:00:: .
He disliked Garth---person%1:03:00:: on sight---sight%1:04:00:: , conservative clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: and haircut---haircut%1:08:00:: , smile---smile%1:10:00:: a shade---shade%1:10:00:: too earnestly boyish for a man---man%1:18:00:: who must be well into his thirties---thirties%1:28:00:: , handclasp---handclasp%1:10:00:: too consciously quick and firm .
Youngish man---man%1:18:00:: on the make , Madden---person%1:03:00:: labeled him , and was ready to guess that in a correct , not too pushing fashion---fashion%1:07:00:: , the junior partner---partner%1:18:00:: of the firm---firm%1:14:00:: had political ambitions---ambition%1:12:00:: ; that Mrs. Garth---person%1:03:00:: would be impeccably suitable as the wife---wife%1:18:00:: of a rising young lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: ; that there were three children---child%1:18:01:: , two boys---boy%1:18:00:: and a girl---girl%1:18:02:: ; that she was active in the Woman 's Club and he in Lions , Rotary---rotary_club%1:14:00:: , and Jaycee ; and finally , that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: since their wedding day---wedding_day%1:28:00:: .
Madden---person%1:03:00:: knew that he could be completely wrong about all this , but also knew that he would go right on disliking Garth---person%1:03:00:: .
Garth---person%1:03:00:: was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with fastidious distaste---distaste%1:12:00:: as this unfortunate Johnston---person%1:03:00:: affair---affair%1:09:00:: , which would not , he said more than once , have ever come about if Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: had only seen fit to consult Mr. Hohlbein---person%1:03:00:: or him about it .
Madden---person%1:03:00:: regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement---statement%1:10:02:: .
He asked to see a copy---copy%1:06:00:: of Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: 's will---will%1:10:00:: .
Garth---person%1:03:00:: brought one out .
The date---date%1:28:00:: , October---october%1:28:00:: 8 , 1957 , immediately caught the inspector---inspector%1:18:01:: 's eye---eye%1:09:01:: .
`` Was she in the habit---habit%1:09:00:: of making new wills---will%1:10:00:: '' ?
She had reason---reason%1:16:00:: to change the one she made right after Mr. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: 's death---death%1:11:00:: .
Her estate---estate%1:21:02:: had grown considerably .
She wanted to make a more equitable distribution---distribution%1:04:00:: of it among the groups---group%1:03:00:: that would benefit the most ; particularly the scholarship---scholarship%1:21:00:: fund---fund%1:21:00:: .
At the time---time%1:28:06:: the will---will%1:10:00:: was drawn Mr. Hohlbein---person%1:03:00:: mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age---age%1:07:00:: , knowing just what changes---change%1:11:00:: she wanted made and so forth '' .
Garth---person%1:03:00:: hesitated .
`` Mr. Hohlbein---person%1:03:00:: and I have noticed some lapses---lapse%1:04:01:: since , though .
Most of them this past year---year%1:28:01:: , I 'd say .
Even two or three years---year%1:28:01:: ago I doubt that she 'd have become involved in this unfortunate Johnston---person%1:03:00:: affair---affair%1:09:00:: .
She always did before , and showed the utmost confidence---confidence%1:12:00:: in whatever we advised '' .
The inspector---inspector%1:18:01:: nodded , doubting this .
Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: had n't struck him as ready to seek anyone 's advise---advice%1:10:00:: , least of all Garth---person%1:03:00:: 's .
With her sharp tongue---sharp_tongue%1:10:00:: she 'd have cut his pompousness---pompousness%1:07:00:: to ribbons .
It would have been Hohlbein---person%1:03:00:: who handled her affairs---affairs%1:09:00:: .
Madden---person%1:03:00:: settled back to read the will---will%1:10:00:: .
He skimmed over the millions that went to Meeker Park---location%1:03:00:: , Medfield Hospital---group%1:03:00:: , the civic center---civic_center%1:06:00:: , the Public Health Nursing Association---group%1:03:00:: , the library---library%1:06:00:: , and so on , pausing when he came to the scholarship---scholarship%1:21:00:: fund---fund%1:21:00:: .
Two millions were added to what had been set aside for it in Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: 's lifetime---lifetime%1:28:00:: , and the proviso---proviso%1:10:00:: made that as long as Brian Thayer---person%1:03:00:: continued to discharge his duties---duty%1:04:02:: as administrator---administrator%1:18:01:: of the fund---fund%1:21:00:: to the satisfaction---satisfaction%1:12:00:: of the board of trustees---board_of_trustees%1:14:00:: ( hereinafter appointed by the bank---bank%1:14:00:: administering the estate---estate%1:21:02:: ) he was to be retained in his present capacity---capacity%1:04:01:: at a salary---salary%1:21:00:: commensurate with the increased responsibilities---responsibility%1:04:00:: enlargement---enlargement%1:04:00:: of the fund---fund%1:21:00:: would entail .
A splendid vote of confidence---vote_of_confidence%1:10:00:: in Thayer---person%1:03:00:: , Madden---person%1:03:00:: reflected .
Tenure---tenure%1:28:00:: , too .
He went on to personal bequests---bequest%1:21:00:: , a list---list%1:10:00:: of names---name%1:10:00:: largely unknown to him .
Twenty-five thousand to each of the great-nieces---great-niece%1:18:00:: in Oregon---oregon%1:15:00:: ( not much to blood relatives---blood_relative%1:18:00:: out of millions ) ten thousand---ten_thousand%1:23:00:: to this friend---friend%1:18:00:: and that , five thousand to another ; to Brian Thayer---person%1:03:00:: , the sum---sum%1:21:00:: of ten thousand---ten_thousand%1:23:00:: dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: ; to the Pecks---person%1:03:00:: , ten thousand---ten_thousand%1:23:00:: each ; to Joan Sheldon---person%1:03:00:: the conditional bequest---bequest%1:21:00:: of ten thousand---ten_thousand%1:23:00:: to be paid to her in the event---event%1:26:00:: that she was still in Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: 's employ---employ%1:26:00:: at the time---time%1:28:06:: of the latter 's death---death%1:11:00:: .
( No additional five thousand for each year---year%1:28:01:: after Joan---person%1:03:00:: 's twenty-first birthday---birthday%1:28:01:: ; Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: had n't got around to taking care of that . )
Too bad , Madden---person%1:03:00:: thought .
Joan Sheldon---person%1:03:00:: had earned the larger bequest---bequest%1:21:00:: .
Mr. Hohlbein---person%1:03:00:: was left twenty thousand , Garth---person%1:03:00:: ten---ten_thousand%1:23:00:: .
There were no other names---name%1:10:00:: Madden---person%1:03:00:: recognized .
Arthur Williams---person%1:03:00:: 's might well have been included , he felt .
Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: had spent a small fortune---small_fortune%1:23:00:: on a search---search%1:04:00:: for him but had made no provision---provision%1:10:00:: for him in her will---will%1:10:00:: if he should be found after her death---death%1:11:00:: , and had never mentioned his name---name%1:10:00:: to her lawyers---lawyer%1:18:00:: .
Madden---person%1:03:00:: took up this point---point%1:09:01:: with Garth---person%1:03:00:: , who shrugged it off .
`` Old people---people%1:14:00:: have their idiosyncrasies---idiosyncrasy%1:07:00:: '' .
`` Well , she had a number---number%1:07:00:: of them where money---money%1:21:00:: was concerned '' , Garth---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Sometimes we 'd have trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: persuading her to make tax-exempt charitable contributions---contribution%1:21:00:: , and I 've known her to quarrel with a plumber---plumber%1:18:00:: over a bill---bill%1:10:01:: for fixing a faucet---faucet%1:06:01:: ; the next moment---moment%1:28:00:: she 'd put another half million into the scholarship---scholarship%1:21:00:: fund---fund%1:21:00:: or thirty thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate Johnston---person%1:03:00:: affair---affair%1:09:00:: .
There was no telling how she 'd react to spending money---money%1:21:00:: '' .
Madden---person%1:03:00:: inquired next about the audit---audit%1:21:00:: of the scholarship---scholarship%1:21:00:: fund---fund%1:21:00:: .
There was an annual audit---audit%1:21:00:: , Garth---person%1:03:00:: informed him .
No discrepancies---discrepancy%1:07:00:: or shortages---shortage%1:07:00:: had ever been found .
Brian Thayer---person%1:03:00:: was a thoroughly honest and competent administrator---administrator%1:18:00:: .
His salary---salary%1:21:00:: had reached the ten thousand---ten_thousand%1:23:00:: mark---mark%1:10:04:: .
His expenses---expense%1:21:01:: ran another four or five thousand .
The lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: did n't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some dinner party---dinner_party%1:14:00:: - Thayer---person%1:03:00:: , like himself , Madden---person%1:03:00:: reflected , was the extra man---man%1:18:00:: so prized by hostesses---hostess%1:18:02:: - and found him easy enough to talk to .
But he did n't play golf---golf%1:04:00:: , did n't seem to belong to any local clubs---club%1:14:00:: - his work---work%1:04:01:: took him away a lot , of course - which probably accounted for his tendency---tendency%1:09:00:: to keep to himself .
Garth---person%1:03:00:: 's glance---glance%1:04:00:: began to flicker to his watch---watch%1:06:00:: .
He said that he had already told the police chief---police_chief%1:18:00:: that he did n't know what insurance---insurance%1:21:02:: man---man%1:18:04:: had recommended Johnston---person%1:03:00:: to Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: .
He would offer no theory---theory%1:09:01:: to account for her murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
The whole thing , his manner---manner%1:07:01:: conveyed , was so far outside the normal routine---routine%1:04:00:: of Hohlbein---person%1:03:00:: and Garth---person%1:03:00:: that it practically demanded being swept under the rug .
No doubt Mrs. Meeker---person%1:03:00:: had snubbed him many a time---time%1:11:00:: and he felt no grief---grief%1:12:00:: over her passing---passing%1:11:00:: .
Even so , Madden---person%1:03:00:: 's dislike---dislike%1:12:00:: of the suave , correct lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: deepened .
It would be all right with him , he decided , if his investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: of the fraud---fraud%1:04:00:: , with its probable by-product---by-product%1:19:00:: of murder---murder%1:04:00:: , led to Garth---person%1:03:00:: 's door---door%1:06:01:: .
It would be all right with him , he decided , if his investigation---investigation%1:04:00:: of the fraud , with its probable by-product of murder , led to Garth 's door .
Motive---motive%1:03:00:: ?
Ten-thousand-dollar bequest---bequest%1:21:00:: .
At first glance , not much---much%1:23:00:: of a motive---motive%1:03:00:: for a man---man%1:18:00:: of his standing---standing%1:26:00:: ; but for all his air of affluence---affluence%1:26:00:: , who could tell what his private financial picture---picture%1:26:00:: was ?
The inspector---inspector%1:18:01:: knew as he left that this was wishful thinking---wishful_thinking%1:09:00:: .
Nevertheless , he made a mental note---note%1:10:00:: to look into Garth---person%1:03:00:: 's financial background---background%1:07:00:: .
Nevertheless , he made a mental note to look into Garth 's financial background---background%1:09:01:: .
Brian Thayer---person%1:03:00:: had a downtown address---address%1:15:00:: .
He lived in an apartment house---apartment_house%1:06:00:: not over three or four years---year%1:28:01:: old , a reclaimed island---island%1:06:00:: of landscaped brick---brick%1:06:00:: and glass---glass%1:27:00:: on the fringe---fringe%1:15:00:: of the business district---business_district%1:15:00:: .
He occupied a two bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: on the fourth floor---floor%1:06:01:: , using the second bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: as his office---office%1:06:00:: .
Airy and bright , the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: was furnished with good modern furniture---furniture%1:06:00:: , rugs---rug%1:06:00:: , and draperies---drapery%1:06:00:: .
Done by a professional decorator---decorator%1:18:01:: , Madden---person%1:03:00:: thought , and somehow as impersonal , as unremarkable as its occupant---occupant%1:18:00:: .
In Dunston---location%1:03:00:: the rent---rent%1:21:00:: would run close to two hundred a month---month%1:28:00:: ; in Medfield---location%1:03:00:: , perhaps twenty-five less , not all of it paid by Thayer---person%1:03:00:: , who could charge off one room---room%1:06:00:: on his expense account---expense_account%1:21:00:: .
He took Madden---person%1:03:00:: into the room---room%1:06:00:: he used as an office---office%1:06:00:: .
It contained a desk---desk%1:06:00:: , files---file%1:10:00:: , a typewriter---typewriter%1:06:00:: on a stand---stand%1:06:00:: , and two big leather---leather%1:27:00:: armchairs---armchair%1:06:00:: .
A newspaper---newspaper%1:06:00:: open at stock-market---stock_market%1:06:00:: reports---report%1:10:00:: lay on one of them .
Thayer---person%1:03:00:: folded it up and offered a drink---drink%1:13:04:: .
The inspector---inspector%1:18:01:: declined .
To begin the interview---interview%1:10:01:: , he asked if Thayer---person%1:03:00:: , with more time---time%1:28:05:: to think it over , could add to what he had said the other day---day%1:28:03:: about Johnston---person%1:03:00:: .
Thayer---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
That and her death---death%1:11:00:: .
It 's still unbelievable that it was murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
For all her domineering ways---way%1:07:01:: , I can n't conceive of her having had a deadly enemy---enemy%1:18:00:: '' .
On April---april%1:28:00:: 17 , 1610 , the sturdy little three masted bark---bark%1:06:00:: , Discovery , weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool---location%1:03:00:: , London---london%1:15:00:: , and floated down the Thames---location%1:03:00:: toward the sea .
She carried , besides her captain---captain%1:18:03:: , a crew---crew%1:14:01:: of twenty-one and provisions---provisions%1:13:00:: for a voyage---voyage%1:04:01:: of exploration---exploration%1:04:02:: of the Arctic---arctic%1:15:00:: waters---water%1:17:00:: of North America---north_america%1:17:00:: .
Seventeen months---month%1:28:01:: later , on September---september%1:28:00:: 6 , 1611 , an Irish fishing boat---fishing_boat%1:06:00:: sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay---location%1:03:00:: .
When she reached port---port%1:15:00:: , she was found to have on board only eight men---men%1:14:00:: , all near starvation---starvation%1:26:00:: .
The captain---captain%1:18:03:: was gone , and the mate---mate%1:18:02:: was gone .
The man---man%1:18:00:: who now commanded her had started the voyage---voyage%1:04:01:: as an ordinary seaman---seaman%1:18:00:: .
What disaster---disaster%1:11:00:: struck the Discovery during those seventeen months---month%1:28:01:: ?
What happened to the fourteen missing men---men%1:14:00:: ?
These questions---question%1:10:00:: have remained one of the great sea---sea%1:17:00:: mysteries---mystery%1:09:00:: of all time .
For hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of years---year%1:28:01:: , the evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain---captain%1:18:03:: 's fragmentary journal---journal%1:10:01:: , ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account---account%1:10:00:: by one of the survivors---survivor%1:18:03:: , ( 3 ) a note---note%1:10:03:: found in a dead man---man%1:18:00:: 's desk---desk%1:06:00:: on board , and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports---report%1:10:01:: .
All told , they offered a highly confused picture---picture%1:26:00:: .
But since 1927 , researchers---researcher%1:18:00:: digging into ancient court---court%1:14:01:: records---record%1:10:02:: and legal files---file%1:10:00:: have been able to find illuminating pieces---piece%1:11:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: .
But since 1927 , researchers digging into ancient court---court%1:14:00:: records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information .
Not enough to do away with all doubts---doubt%1:09:00:: , but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture---picture%1:10:03:: of the events---event%1:03:00:: of the voyage---voyage%1:04:01:: .
Historians---historian%1:18:00:: have had two reasons---reason%1:16:00:: for persisting so long in their investigations---investigation%1:04:00:: .
First , they wanted to clarify a tantalizing , bizarre enigma---enigma%1:09:00:: .
Second , they believed it important to determine the fate---fate%1:11:00:: of the captain---captain%1:18:03:: - a man---man%1:18:00:: whose name---name%1:10:00:: is permanently stamped on our maps---map%1:06:00:: , on American towns---town%1:15:00:: and counties---county%1:15:00:: , on a great American river---river%1:17:00:: , and on half---half%1:23:00:: a million square miles---square_mile%1:23:00:: of Arctic---arctic%1:15:00:: seas---sea%1:17:00:: .
The name---name%1:10:00:: : Henry Hudson---person%1:03:00:: .
This is the story---story%1:10:04:: of his last tragic voyage---voyage%1:04:01:: , as nearly as we are able - or ever , probably , will be able - to determine :
The sailing---sailing%1:04:02:: in the spring---spring%1:28:00:: of 1610 was Hudson---person%1:03:00:: 's fourth in four years---year%1:28:01:: .
Each time---time%1:11:00:: his objective---objective%1:09:00:: had been the same - a direct water---water%1:17:00:: passage---passage%1:06:00:: from Western Europe---europe%1:17:00:: to the Far East---far_east%1:15:00:: .
In 1607 and 1608 , the English Muscovy Company---group%1:03:00:: had sent him northward to look for a route---route%1:15:00:: over the North Pole---north_pole%1:15:00:: or across the top---top%1:15:01:: of Russia---russia%1:15:00:: .
Twice he had failed , and the Muscovy Company---group%1:03:00:: indicated it would not back him again .
In 1609 , the Dutch East India Company---group%1:03:00:: hired Hudson---person%1:03:00:: , gave him two learned geographers---geographer%1:18:00:: , fitted him out with a ship---ship%1:06:00:: called the Half Moon , and supplied him with Dutch sailors---sailor%1:18:00:: .
This time---time%1:11:00:: he turned westward , to the middle Atlantic coast---coast%1:17:00:: of North America---north_america%1:17:00:: .
His chief discovery---discovery%1:10:00:: was important - the Great North---location%1:03:00:: ( later , the Hudson---hudson%1:17:00:: ) River - but it produced no northwest passage---passage%1:06:00:: .
When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth---location%1:03:00:: , England---england%1:15:00:: , in the fall---fall%1:28:00:: of 1609 , word---word%1:10:02:: of Hudson---person%1:03:00:: 's findings---finding%1:04:00:: leaked out , and English interest---interest%1:09:00:: in him revived .
The government---government%1:14:00:: forbade Hudson---person%1:03:00:: to return to Amsterdam---amsterdam%1:15:00:: with his ship---ship%1:06:00:: .
He thereupon went to London---london%1:15:00:: and spent the winter---winter%1:28:00:: talking to men---man%1:18:00:: of wealth---wealth%1:26:00:: .
By springtime---springtime%1:28:00:: , he was supported by a rich merchant---merchant%1:18:00:: syndicate---syndicate%1:14:00:: under the patronage---patronage%1:04:00:: of Henry---person%1:03:00:: , Prince of Wales---prince_of_wales%1:18:00:: .
He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship---ship%1:06:00:: called the Discovery and had recruited a crew---crew%1:14:01:: of twenty-one , the largest he had ever commanded .
The purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of this fourth voyage---voyage%1:04:01:: was clear .
A century---century%1:28:00:: of exploration---exploration%1:04:02:: had established that a great land mass---landmass%1:17:00:: , North and South America---america%1:17:00:: , lay between Europe---europe%1:17:00:: and the Indies---the_indies%1:15:00:: .
One by one , the openings---opening%1:17:00:: in the coast---coast%1:17:00:: that promised a passage---passage%1:06:00:: through had been explored and discarded .
In fact , Hudson---person%1:03:00:: 's sail---sail%1:04:00:: up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes---hope%1:18:00:: .
But there remained one mysterious , unexplored gap---gap%1:17:00:: , far to the north .
Nearly twenty-five years---year%1:28:01:: before , Captain John Davis---person%1:03:00:: had noted , as he sailed near the Arctic Circle---arctic_circle%1:15:00:: , `` a very great gulf---gulf%1:17:01:: , the water---water%1:17:00:: whirling and roaring , as it were the meeting---meeting%1:04:02:: of tides---tide%1:11:00:: '' .
He named this opening---opening%1:17:00:: , between Baffin Island---baffin_island%1:15:00:: and Labrador---labrador%1:15:00:: , the `` Furious Overfall---location%1:03:00:: '' .
( Later , it was to be called Hudson Strait---location%1:03:00:: . )
In 1602 , George Waymouth , in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded , had sailed 300 miles---mile%1:23:04:: up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back .
In 1602 , George Waymouth---person%1:03:00:: , in the same little Discovery that Hudson---person%1:03:00:: now commanded , had sailed 300 miles---mile%1:23:01:: up the strait---strait%1:17:00:: before his frightened men---men%1:14:00:: turned the ship---ship%1:06:00:: back .
Hudson---person%1:03:00:: now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas---sea%1:17:00:: beyond for the long sought waterway---waterway%1:17:00:: .
Even Hudson---person%1:03:00:: , experienced in Arctic sailing---sailing%1:04:01:: and determined as he was , must have had qualms---qualm%1:12:00:: as he slid down the Thames---location%1:03:00:: .
Ahead were perilous , ice---ice%1:27:00:: filled waters---water%1:17:00:: .
On previous voyages---voyage%1:04:01:: , it had been in precisely such dangerous situations---situation%1:26:01:: that he had failed as a leader---leader%1:18:00:: and captain---captain%1:18:03:: .
On the second voyage---voyage%1:04:01:: , he had turned back at the frozen island---island%1:17:00:: of Novaya Zemlya---location%1:03:00:: and meekly given the crew---crew%1:14:01:: a certificate---certificate%1:10:00:: stating that he did so of his own free will---free_will%1:07:00:: - which was obviously not the case---case%1:26:00:: .
On the third voyage---voyage%1:04:01:: , a near mutiny---mutiny%1:04:00:: rising from a quarrel---quarrel%1:10:00:: between Dutch and English crew members---crew_member%1:18:00:: on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship---ship%1:06:00:: back to Amsterdam---amsterdam%1:15:00:: in mid Atlantic---atlantic%1:17:00:: .
Worse , his present crew---crew%1:14:01:: included five men---man%1:18:00:: who had sailed with him before .
Of only one could he be sure - young John Hudson---person%1:03:00:: , his second son---son%1:18:00:: .
The mate---mate%1:18:02:: , Robert Juet---person%1:03:00:: , who had kept the journal---journal%1:10:01:: on the half Moon , was experienced - but he was a bitter old man---old_man%1:18:02:: , ready to complain or desert at any opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: .
Philip Staffe---person%1:03:00:: , the ship---ship%1:06:00:: 's carpenter---carpenter%1:18:00:: , was a good worker---worker%1:18:00:: , but perversely independent .
Arnold Lodley---person%1:03:00:: and Michael Perse---person%1:03:00:: were like the rest---rest%1:24:00:: - lukewarm , ready to swing against Hudson---person%1:03:00:: in a crisis---crisis%1:26:00:: .
But men---man%1:18:00:: willing to sail at all into waters---water%1:17:00:: where wooden ships---ship%1:06:00:: could be crushed like eggs---eggs%1:13:00:: were hard to find .
Hudson---person%1:03:00:: knew he had to use these men---man%1:18:00:: as long as he remained an explorer---explorer%1:18:00:: .
It is believed that Hudson---person%1:03:00:: was related to other seafaring men---man%1:18:00:: of the Muscovy Company---group%1:03:00:: and was trained on company---company%1:14:01:: ships---ship%1:06:00:: .
He was a Londoner---londoner%1:18:00:: , married , with three sons---son%1:18:00:: .
( The common misconception---misconception%1:09:00:: that he was Dutch and that his first name---first_name%1:10:00:: was Hendrik---person%1:03:00:: stem from Dutch documents---document%1:10:00:: of his third voyage---voyage%1:04:01:: . )
In 1610 , Hudson---person%1:03:00:: was probably in his early forties---forties%1:28:00:: , a good navigator---navigator%1:18:02:: , a stubborn voyager---voyager%1:18:00:: , but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession---profession%1:04:00:: .
Hudson---person%1:03:00:: 's first error---error%1:04:02:: of the fourth voyage---voyage%1:04:01:: occurred only a few miles---mile%1:23:01:: down the Thames---location%1:03:00:: .
There at the river---river%1:17:00:: 's edge---edge%1:15:00:: waited one Henry Greene---person%1:03:00:: , whom Hudson---person%1:03:00:: listed as a `` clerk---clerk%1:18:00:: '' .
Greene---person%1:03:00:: was in actuality---actuality%1:26:00:: a young ruffian---ruffian%1:18:00:: from Kent---kent%1:15:00:: , who had broken with his parents---parent%1:18:00:: in order to keep the company he preferred - pimps---pimp%1:18:00:: , panders---pander%1:18:00:: and whores---whore%1:18:00:: .
He was not the sort---sort%1:09:00:: of sailor---sailor%1:18:00:: Hudson---person%1:03:00:: wanted his backers---backer%1:18:00:: to see on board and he had Greene---person%1:03:00:: wait at Gravesend---location%1:03:00:: , where the Discovery picked him up .
For the first three weeks---week%1:28:00:: , the ship---ship%1:06:00:: skirted up the east coast---coast%1:17:00:: of Great Britain---great_britain%1:15:00:: , then turned westward .
On May---may%1:28:00:: 11 , she reached Iceland---iceland%1:15:01:: .
Poor winds---wind%1:19:00:: and fog---fog%1:19:00:: locked her up in a harbor---harbor%1:15:00:: the crew---crew%1:14:01:: called `` Lousie Bay---location%1:03:00:: '' .
Poor winds and fog---fog%1:26:01:: locked her up in a harbor the crew called `` Lousie Bay '' .
The subsequent two-weeks---two_weeks%1:28:00:: wait---wait%1:28:00:: made the crew---crew%1:14:01:: quarrelsome .
With Hudson---person%1:03:00:: looking on , his protege---protege%1:18:00:: Greene---person%1:03:00:: picked a fight with the ship---ship%1:06:00:: 's surgeon---surgeon%1:18:00:: , Edward Wilson---person%1:03:00:: .
The issue---issue%1:09:01:: was settled on shore , Greene---person%1:03:00:: winning and Wilson---person%1:03:00:: remaining ashore , determined to catch the next fishing boat---fishing_boat%1:06:00:: back to England---england%1:15:00:: .
With difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: , Hudson---person%1:03:00:: persuaded him to rejoin the ship---ship%1:06:00:: , and they sailed from Iceland---iceland%1:15:01:: .
Early in June---june%1:28:00:: , the Discovery passed `` Desolation---location%1:03:00:: '' ( southern Greenland---greenland%1:15:00:: ) and in mid-June---mid-june%1:28:00:: entered the `` Furious Overfall---location%1:03:00:: '' .
Floating ice---ice%1:27:00:: bore down from the north---north%1:24:00:: and west---west%1:24:00:: .
Fog---fog%1:19:00:: hung over the route---route%1:15:00:: constantly .
Turbulent tides---tide%1:11:00:: rose as much as fifty feet---foot%1:23:00:: .
The ship---ship%1:06:00:: 's compass---compass%1:06:00:: was useless because of the nearness---nearness%1:07:00:: of the magnetic North Pole---north_pole%1:15:00:: .
As the bergs---berg%1:17:00:: grew larger , Hudson---person%1:03:00:: was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay---location%1:03:00:: , an inlet---inlet%1:17:00:: of the great strait---strait%1:17:00:: .
After finding that its coasts---coast%1:17:00:: led nowhere , however , he turned north again , toward the main , ice---ice%1:27:00:: filled passageway---passageway%1:08:00:: - and the crew---crew%1:14:01:: , at first uneasy , then frightened , rebelled .
The trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: was at least partly Juet---person%1:03:00:: 's doing .
For weeks---week%1:28:00:: he had been saying that Hudson---person%1:03:00:: 's idea---idea%1:09:00:: of sailing through to Java---java%1:15:00:: was absurd .
The great , crushing ice---ice%1:27:00:: masses---mass%1:17:00:: coming into view---view%1:15:00:: made him sound like the voice---voice%1:10:01:: of pure reason---reason%1:26:00:: .
A group---group%1:03:00:: of sailors---sailor%1:18:00:: announced to Hudson---person%1:03:00:: that they would sail no farther .
Instead of quelling the dissension---dissension%1:10:00:: , as many captains---captain%1:18:03:: of the era---era%1:28:00:: would have done ( Sir Francis Drake---person%1:03:00:: lopped a man---man%1:18:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: off under similar circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: ) , Hudson---person%1:03:00:: decided to be reasonable .
He went to his cabin---cabin%1:06:01:: and emerged carrying a large chart---chart%1:06:00:: , which he set up in view of the crew---crew%1:14:01:: .
Patiently , he explained what he knew about their course---course%1:17:00:: and their objectives---objective%1:09:00:: .
When Hudson---person%1:03:00:: had finished , the `` town meeting---town_meeting%1:14:01:: '' broke down into a general , wordy argument---argument%1:10:03:: .
One man---man%1:18:00:: remarked that if he had a hundred pounds---pound%1:23:01:: , he would give ninety of them to be back in England---england%1:15:00:: .
Up spoke carpenter---carpenter%1:18:00:: Staffe---person%1:03:00:: , who said he would n't give ten pounds---pound%1:23:01:: to be home .
The statement---statement%1:10:00:: was effective .
The meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: broke up .
Hudson---person%1:03:00:: was free to sail on .
All through July---july%1:28:00:: the Discovery picked her way---way%1:06:00:: along the 450 - mile---mile%1:23:01:: long strait---strait%1:17:00:: , avoiding ice---ice%1:27:00:: and rocky islands---island%1:17:00:: .
On August---august%1:28:00:: 3 , two massive headlands---headland%1:17:00:: reared out of the mists---mist%1:19:00:: - great gateways---gateway%1:06:00:: never before , so far as Hudson---person%1:03:00:: knew , seen by Europeans---european%1:18:00:: .
To starboard---starboard%1:06:00:: was a cape---cape%1:17:00:: a thousand feet---foot%1:23:00:: high , patched with ice---ice%1:27:00:: and snow---snow%1:27:00:: , populated by thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of screaming sea birds---sea_bird%1:05:00:: .
To port---port%1:06:02:: was a point---point%1:17:02:: 200 feet---foot%1:23:00:: high rising behind to a precipice---precipice%1:17:00:: of 2000 feet---foot%1:23:00:: .
Hudson---person%1:03:00:: named the capes---cape%1:17:00:: Digges---person%1:03:00:: and Wolstenholme---person%1:03:00:: , for two---two%1:23:00:: of his backers---backer%1:18:00:: .
Hudson---person%1:03:00:: pointed the Discovery down the east coast---coast%1:17:00:: of the newly discovered sea---sea%1:17:00:: ( now called Hudson Bay---hudson_bay%1:17:00:: ) , confident he was on his way to the warm waters---water%1:17:00:: of the Pacific---pacific%1:17:00:: .
After three weeks---week%1:28:00:: ' swift sailing---sailing%1:04:01:: , however , the ship---ship%1:06:00:: entered an area---area%1:15:01:: of shallow marshes---marsh%1:17:00:: and river---river%1:17:00:: deltas---delta%1:17:00:: .
The ship---ship%1:06:00:: halted .
The great `` sea---sea%1:17:00:: to the westwards '' was a dead end---dead_end%1:06:00:: .
This must have been Hudson---person%1:03:00:: 's blackest discovery---discovery%1:10:00:: .
For he seemed to sense at once that before him was no South Sea---south_sea%1:17:00:: , but the solid bulk---bulk%1:07:00:: of the North American continent---continent%1:17:00:: .
This was the bitter end---bitter_end%1:26:00:: , and Hudson---person%1:03:00:: seemed to know he was destined to failure---failure%1:04:00:: .
Feverishly , he tried to brush away this intuition---intuition%1:09:01:: .
North and south , east and west , back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay---bay%1:17:00:: , plowing furiously forward until land---land%1:17:00:: appeared , then turning to repeat the process---process%1:04:00:: , day after day , week after week .
Hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of miles---mile%1:23:01:: to the north , the route---route%1:15:00:: back to England---england%1:15:00:: through the `` Furious Overfall---location%1:03:00:: '' was again filling with ice---ice%1:27:00:: .
The men---men%1:14:00:: were at first puzzled , then angered by the aimless tacking .
Once more , Juet---person%1:03:00:: 's complaints---complaint%1:10:00:: were the loudest .
Hudson---person%1:03:00:: 's reply---reply%1:10:01:: was to accuse the mate---mate%1:18:02:: of disloyalty---disloyalty%1:07:00:: .
Juet---person%1:03:00:: demanded that Hudson---person%1:03:00:: prove his charges---charge%1:10:00:: in an open trial .
The trial was held September---september%1:28:00:: 10 .
Hudson---person%1:03:00:: , presiding , heard Juet---person%1:03:00:: 's defense---defense%1:10:01:: , then called for testimony---testimony%1:10:00:: from crew members---crew_member%1:18:00:: .
Juet---person%1:03:00:: had made plentiful enemies---enemy%1:18:00:: , several men---man%1:18:00:: stepped forward .
Hands---hand%1:08:00:: on Bible---bible%1:10:00:: , seaman---seaman%1:18:00:: Lodley---person%1:03:00:: and carpenter---carpenter%1:18:00:: Staffe---person%1:03:00:: swore that Juet---person%1:03:00:: had tried to persuade them to keep muskets---musket%1:06:00:: and swords---sword%1:06:00:: in their cabins---cabin%1:06:01:: .
Cook Bennett Mathues---person%1:03:00:: said Juet---person%1:03:00:: had predicted bloodshed---bloodshed%1:04:01:: on the ship---ship%1:06:00:: .
Others added that Juet---person%1:03:00:: had wanted to turn the ship---ship%1:06:00:: homeward .
Hudson---person%1:03:00:: deposed Juet---person%1:03:00:: and cut his pay---pay%1:21:01:: .
The new mate---mate%1:18:02:: was Robert Bylot---person%1:03:00:: , talented but inexperienced .
There were other shifts---shift%1:04:01:: and pay cuts---pay_cut%1:04:00:: according to the way---way%1:07:01:: individuals---individual%1:03:00:: had conducted themselves .
The important result---result%1:11:00:: , however , was that Juet---person%1:03:00:: and Francis Clemens---person%1:03:00:: , the deposed boatswain---boatswain%1:18:00:: , became Hudson---person%1:03:00:: 's sworn enemies---enemy%1:18:00:: .
As Hudson---person%1:03:00:: resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay---bay%1:17:00:: , every incident---incident%1:11:00:: lessened the crew---crew%1:14:01:: 's respect---respect%1:26:00:: for him .
Once , after the Discovery lay for a week---week%1:28:00:: in rough weather---weather%1:19:00:: , Hudson---person%1:03:00:: ordered the anchor---anchor%1:06:00:: raised before the sea---sea%1:17:00:: had calmed .
Just as it was being hauled inboard , a sea---sea%1:17:00:: hit the ship---ship%1:06:00:: .
Michael Butt---person%1:03:00:: and Adame Moore---person%1:03:00:: were thrown off the capstan---capstan%1:06:00:: and badly injured .
The anchor---anchor%1:06:00:: cable---cable%1:06:00:: would have been lost overboard , but Philip Staffe---person%1:03:00:: was on hand to sever it with his axe---axe%1:06:00:: .
In the century---century%1:28:00:: from 1815 to 1914 the law of nations---law_of_nations%1:14:00:: became international law---international_law%1:14:00:: .
Several factors---factor%1:11:00:: contributed to this change---change%1:19:00:: .
The Congress of Vienna is a convenient starting point---starting_point%1:28:00:: because it both epitomized and symbolized what was to follow .
Here in 1815 the great nations---nation%1:14:00:: assembled to legislate not merely for Europe---europe%1:17:00:: , but for the world---world%1:17:00:: .
Thus the Congress marks a formal recognition---recognition%1:26:00:: of the political system---political_system%1:14:00:: that was central to world---world%1:17:00:: politics---politics%1:24:00:: for a century---century%1:28:00:: .
International law---international_law%1:14:00:: had to fit the conditions---condition%1:26:00:: of Europe---europe%1:17:00:: , and nothing that could not fit this system---system%1:09:00:: , or the interests---interest%1:07:01:: of the great European nations---european_nation%1:15:00:: collectively , could possibly emerge as law---law%1:14:00:: in any meaningful sense---sense%1:10:00:: .
Essentially this imposed two conditions---condition%1:10:01:: : First , international law---international_law%1:14:00:: had to recognize and be compatible with an international political system---political_system%1:14:00:: in which a number---number%1:07:00:: of states---state%1:14:00:: were competitive , suspicious , and opportunistic in their political alignments---alignment%1:14:00:: with one another ; second , it had to be compatible with the value system---value-system%1:09:00:: that they shared .
In both respects---respect%1:09:00:: , international law---international_law%1:14:00:: was Europeanized .
It was not always easy to develop theory---theory%1:09:00:: and doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: which would square the two conditions---condition%1:10:01:: .
On the one hand , the major European nations---european_nation%1:15:00:: had to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: upon sovereignty---sovereignty%1:26:00:: , independence---independence%1:26:00:: , formal equality---equality%1:26:00:: - thus insuring for themselves individually an optimal freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: of action---action%1:26:00:: to maintain the `` flexibility---flexibility%1:07:01:: of alignment---alignment%1:14:00:: '' that the system---system%1:09:01:: required and to avoid anything approaching a repetition---repetition%1:04:00:: of the disastrous Napoleonic experience---experience%1:11:00:: .
But there was no pressing need---need%1:03:00:: to maintain these same standards---standard%1:09:00:: with regard to most of the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the world---world%1:17:00:: .
Thus , theory---theory%1:09:00:: and doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: applicable among the great nations---nation%1:14:00:: and the smaller European states---state%1:14:00:: did not really comfortably fit less developed and less powerful societies---society%1:14:00:: elsewhere .
Political interference---interference%1:10:00:: in Africa---africa%1:17:00:: and Asia---asia%1:17:00:: and even in Latin America---latin_america%1:15:00:: ( though limited in Latin America---latin_america%1:15:00:: by the special interest---interest%1:09:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: as expressed in the Monroe Doctrine---monroe_doctrine%1:10:00:: , itself from the outset---outset%1:28:00:: related to European politics---politics%1:24:00:: and long dependent upon the `` balance of power---balance_of_power%1:26:00:: '' system---system%1:09:00:: in Europe---europe%1:17:00:: ) was necessary in order to preserve both common economic values---economic_value%1:21:00:: and the European `` balance---balance_of_power%1:26:00:: '' itself .
A nation---nation%1:14:00:: such as Switzerland---switzerland%1:15:00:: could be neutralized by agreement---agreement%1:10:01:: and could be relied upon to protect its neutrality---neutrality%1:04:00:: ; more doubtful , but possible , ( with an assist---assist%1:04:00:: from the North---north%1:15:00:: ) was the neutralization---neutralization%1:04:01:: of the Latin American countries---country%1:14:00:: ; out of the question was the neutralization---neutralization%1:04:01:: of Asia---asia%1:17:00:: and Africa---africa%1:17:00:: .
This Europeanization of the law---law%1:14:00:: was made explicit by a number---number%1:07:00:: of 19 th century---century%1:28:00:: scholars---scholar%1:18:00:: .
More emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: was put upon the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that international law---international_law%1:14:00:: was the law---law%1:14:00:: of `` civilized nations---nation%1:14:00:: '' ; Kent---person%1:03:00:: and Story---person%1:03:00:: , the great early American scholars---scholar%1:18:00:: , repeatedly made use of this phrase---phrase%1:10:00:: , or of `` Christian nations---nation%1:14:00:: '' , which is a substantial equivalent---equivalent%1:09:00:: .
Wheaton---person%1:03:00:: stated that the public law---public_law%1:10:00:: was essentially `` limited to the civilized and Christian peoples---people%1:14:00:: of Europe---europe%1:17:00:: or to those of European origin---origin%1:07:00:: '' .
Of course it had always been of European origin---origin%1:15:00:: in fact , but it had maintained a universal outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: under the natural law---natural_law%1:09:00:: theory---theory%1:09:00:: .
Now , with virtually every writer---writer%1:18:01:: , not only was the European origin---origin%1:15:00:: of public law---public_law%1:10:00:: acknowledged as a historical phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: , but the rules---rule%1:09:00:: thus established by the advanced civilizations---civilization%1:14:00:: of Europe---europe%1:17:00:: were to be imposed on others .
The European customs---custom%1:09:00:: on which international law---international_law%1:14:00:: was based were to become , by force---force%1:04:01:: and fiat---fiat%1:10:00:: , the customs---custom%1:09:00:: that others were to accept as law---law%1:14:00:: if they were to join this community---community%1:14:04:: as sovereign states---state%1:14:00:: .
Hall---person%1:03:00:: , for example , was quite explicit on this point---point%1:09:01:: when he said `` states---state%1:14:00:: outside European civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: must formally enter into the circle---circle%1:14:00:: of law---law%1:14:00:: governed countries---country%1:14:00:: .
They must do something with the acquiescence---acquiescence%1:10:00:: of the latter , or some of them , which amounts to an acceptance---acceptance%1:10:01:: of the law---law%1:14:00:: in its entirety---entirety%1:26:00:: beyond all possibility---possibility%1:09:03:: of misconstruction---misconstruction%1:10:01:: '' .
During the nineteenth century---century%1:28:00:: these views---view%1:09:02:: were protested by virtually all the Latin American---latin_american%1:18:00:: writers---writer%1:18:00:: , though ineffectively , just as the new nations---nation%1:14:00:: of Africa---africa%1:17:00:: and Asia---asia%1:17:00:: protest them , with more effect---effect%1:19:00:: , today---today%1:28:00:: .
A number---number%1:07:00:: of other nineteenth century---century%1:28:00:: developments---development%1:11:01:: contributed to the transmutation---transmutation%1:11:00:: of the law of nations---law_of_nations%1:14:00:: into international law---international_law%1:14:00:: ; that is , from aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of a universal system---system%1:09:00:: of Justice---justice%1:07:00:: into particular rules---rule%1:10:00:: governing the relations---relations%1:24:00:: of sovereign states---state%1:14:00:: .
The difference---difference%1:07:00:: is important , for although the older law of nations---law_of_nations%1:14:00:: did cover relationships---relationship%1:24:00:: among sovereigns---sovereign%1:18:00:: , this was by no means its exclusive domain---domain%1:26:00:: .
The law---law%1:14:00:: of nature---nature%1:17:00:: governed sovereigns---sovereign%1:18:00:: in their relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: to their own citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: , to foreigners---foreigner%1:18:00:: , and to each other in a conceptually unified system---system%1:09:00:: .
The theory---theory%1:09:00:: of international law---international_law%1:14:00:: , which in the nineteenth century---century%1:28:00:: became common to virtually all writers---writer%1:18:00:: in Europe---europe%1:17:00:: and America---america%1:15:00:: , broke this unity---unity%1:26:00:: and this universality---universality%1:07:00:: .
It lost sight---sight%1:09:01:: of the individual---individual%1:03:00:: almost entirely and confined itself to rules---rule%1:09:00:: limiting the exercise---exercise%1:04:03:: of state---state%1:14:00:: power---power%1:07:00:: for reasons---reason%1:16:00:: essentially unconnected with justice---justice%1:07:00:: or morality---morality%1:07:00:: save as these values---values%1:09:00:: might affect international relations---relations%1:24:00:: .
No longer did the sovereign look to the law of nations---law_of_nations%1:14:00:: to determine what he ought to do ; his search---search%1:04:02:: was merely for rules---rule%1:10:00:: that might limit his freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: of action---action%1:26:00:: .
To appreciate this development---development%1:11:01:: , we must relate it to other aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: of nineteenth century---century%1:28:00:: philosophy---philosophy%1:09:00:: .
First , and most obvious , was the growing nationalism---nationalism%1:09:00:: and the tendency---tendency%1:09:00:: to regard the state---state%1:14:00:: , and the individual---individual%1:18:00:: 's identification with the state---state%1:14:00:: , as transcending other ties---tie%1:26:01:: of social solidarity---solidarity%1:07:00:: .
National identification was not new , but it was accelerating in intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: and scope---scope%1:07:00:: throughout Europe---europe%1:17:00:: as new unifications---unification%1:11:00:: occurred .
It reached its ultimate philosophical statement---statement%1:10:00:: in notions---notion%1:09:00:: of `` state---state%1:14:00:: will---will%1:09:00:: '' put forward by the Germans---german%1:18:00:: , especially by Hegel---hegel%1:18:00:: , although political philosophers---philosopher%1:18:00:: will recognize its origins---origin%1:15:00:: in the rejected doctrines---doctrine%1:09:00:: of Hobbes---person%1:03:00:: .
National identification was reflected jurisprudentially in law---law%1:09:02:: theories---theory%1:09:00:: which incorporated this Hegelian abstraction---abstraction%1:09:00:: and saw law---law%1:14:00:: , domestic and international , simply as its formal reflection---reflection%1:10:01:: .
In the international community---community%1:14:00:: this reduced law---law%1:09:02:: to Jellinek---person%1:03:00:: 's auto limitation---auto_limitation%1:04:00:: .
A state---state%1:14:00:: , the highest form---form%1:09:01:: of human organization---organization%1:14:00:: in fact---fact%1:26:01:: and theory---theory%1:09:00:: , could be subjected to Law---law%1:14:00:: only by a manifestation---manifestation%1:11:00:: of self-will---self-will%1:07:01:: , or consent---consent%1:10:00:: .
According to the new theories---theory%1:09:01:: , the nineteenth century---century%1:28:00:: corporate sovereign---sovereign%1:18:00:: was `` sovereign '' in a quite new and different sense---sense%1:10:00:: from his historical predecessors---predecessor%1:18:00:: .
He no longer sought to find the law---law%1:14:00:: ; he made it ; he could be subjected to law---law%1:14:00:: only because he agreed to be .
There was no law---law%1:14:00:: , domestic or international , except that willed by , acknowledged by , or consented to by states---state%1:14:00:: .
Hidden behind Hegelian abstractions---abstraction%1:09:00:: were more practical reasons---reason%1:16:00:: for a changing jurisprudence---jurisprudence%1:09:00:: .
Related to , but distinguishable from , nationalism---nationalism%1:09:00:: was the growth---growth%1:11:01:: of democracy---democracy%1:09:00:: in one form---form%1:09:01:: or another .
Related to , but distinguishable from , nationalism was the growth---growth%1:22:01:: of democracy in one form or another .
Increased participation in politics---politics%1:24:00:: and the demands of various groups for status and recognition had dramatic effects upon law institutions .
Increased participation---participation%1:04:00:: in politics---politics%1:04:00:: and the demands---demand%1:10:00:: of various groups---group%1:03:00:: for status---status%1:26:00:: and recognition---recognition%1:26:00:: had dramatic effects---effect%1:19:00:: upon law---law%1:14:00:: institutions---institution%1:14:00:: .
The efforts---effort%1:04:00:: of various interest---interest%1:14:00:: groups---group%1:03:00:: to control or influence governmental decisions---decision%1:04:00:: , particularly when taken in conjunction---conjunction%1:26:00:: with the impact---impact%1:19:00:: of industrialization---industrialization%1:04:00:: , led to a concentration---concentration%1:11:00:: of attention---attention%1:09:00:: on the legislative power---power%1:18:00:: and the means---means%1:04:00:: whereby policy---policy%1:10:00:: could be formulated and enforced as law---law%1:14:00:: through bureaucratic institutions---institution%1:14:00:: .
Law---law%1:04:00:: became a conscious process---process%1:04:00:: , something more than simply doing justice---justice%1:07:00:: and looking to local customs---custom%1:04:00:: and a common morality---morality%1:16:00:: for applicable norms---norm%1:24:00:: .
Particularly was this true when the norms---norm%1:24:00:: previously applied were no longer satisfactory to many , when customs---custom%1:04:00:: were rapidly changing as the forces---force%1:07:01:: of the new productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: were harnessed .
The old way---way%1:07:01:: of doing things---thing%1:04:00:: , which depended on a relatively stable community---community%1:14:00:: with stable ideas---idea%1:09:00:: dealing with familiar situations---situation%1:26:00:: , was no longer adequate to the task---task%1:04:01:: .
First was the period---period%1:28:00:: of codification---codification%1:04:00:: of existing law---law%1:14:00:: : the Code Napoleon in France---france%1:15:00:: and the peculiar codification---codification%1:10:00:: that , in fact , resulted from Austin---person%1:03:00:: 's restatement---restatement%1:10:00:: and ordering---ordering%1:14:00:: of the Common Law---common_law%1:10:00:: in England---england%1:15:00:: .
Codification---codification%1:04:00:: was followed in all countries---country%1:14:00:: by a growing amount---amount%1:07:00:: of legislation---legislation%1:10:00:: , some changing and adjusting the older law---law%1:14:00:: , much---much%1:23:00:: dealing with entirely new situations---situation%1:26:00:: .
The legislative mills---mill%1:06:01:: have been grinding ever since , and when its cumbersome processes---process%1:04:00:: were no longer adequate to the task---task%1:04:01:: , a limited legislative authority---authority%1:07:00:: was delegated in one form---form%1:09:01:: or another , to the executive---executive%1:14:01:: .
Whereas the eighteenth century---century%1:28:00:: had been a time---time%1:28:00:: in which man sought justice---justice%1:07:00:: , the nineteenth and twentieth have been centuries---century%1:28:00:: in which men---man%1:05:01:: are satisfied with law---law%1:14:00:: .
Indeed , with developed positivism---positivism%1:09:00:: , the separation---separation%1:26:00:: of law---law%1:14:00:: from justice---justice%1:07:00:: , or from morality---morality%1:07:00:: generally , became quite specific .
In municipal systems---system%1:14:00:: we tend to view what is called positivism---positivism%1:09:00:: as fundamentally a movement---movement%1:04:03:: to democratize policy---policy%1:10:00:: by increasing the power---power%1:07:00:: of parliament---parliament%1:14:00:: - the elected representatives---representative%1:18:01:: - at the expense---expense%1:11:00:: of the more conservative judiciary---judiciary%1:14:00:: .
When the power---power%1:07:00:: of the latter was made both limited and explicit - when norms---norm%1:24:00:: were clarified and made more precise and the creation---creation%1:04:00:: of new norms---norm%1:24:00:: was placed exclusively in parliamentary hands---hands%1:04:00:: - two purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: were served : Government---government%1:14:00:: was made subservient to an institutionalized popular will---will%1:09:00:: , and law---law%1:14:00:: became a rational system---system%1:09:01:: for implementing that will---will%1:09:00:: , for serving conscious goals---goal%1:09:00:: , for embodying the `` public policy---policy%1:09:00:: '' .
It is true that , initially , the task---task%1:04:01:: was to remove restrictions---restriction%1:09:00:: that , it was thought , inhibited the free flow---flow%1:04:00:: of money---money%1:21:00:: , goods , and labor---labor%1:14:00:: ; but even laissez-faire---laissez_faire%1:09:00:: was a conscious policy---policy%1:09:00:: .
Law---law%1:14:00:: was seen as an emanation---emanation%1:27:00:: of the `` sovereign will---will%1:09:00:: '' .
However , the sovereign---sovereign%1:18:00:: was not Hobbes---person%1:03:00:: ' absolute monarch---monarch%1:18:00:: but rather the parliamentary sovereign---sovereign%1:18:00:: of Austin---person%1:03:00:: .
It was , too , an optimistic philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: , and , though it separated law---law%1:14:00:: from morality---morality%1:07:00:: , it was by no means an immoral or amoral one .
Man , through democratic institutions---institution%1:14:00:: of government---government%1:04:00:: and economic freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: , was master---master%1:18:04:: of his destiny---destiny%1:11:00:: .
The theory---theory%1:09:00:: did not require , though it unfortunately might acquire , a Hegelian mystique---mystique%1:07:00:: .
It was merely a rationalization---rationalization%1:09:00:: and ordering---ordering%1:14:00:: of new institutions---institution%1:14:00:: of popular government---government%1:04:00:: .
It was not opposed to either justice---justice%1:07:00:: or morality---morality%1:07:00:: ; it merely wished to minimize subjective views---view%1:09:02:: of officials---official%1:18:01:: who wielded public authority---authority%1:07:00:: .
Particularly was this true as laissez-faire capitalism---capitalism%1:14:00:: became the dominant credo---credo%1:09:00:: of Western society---society%1:14:00:: .
To free the factors---factor%1:11:00:: of production---production%1:04:00:: was a major objective---objective%1:09:00:: of the rising bourgeoisie---bourgeoisie%1:14:00:: , and this objective---objective%1:09:00:: required that governmental authority---authority%1:07:00:: - administrative officials---administrative_official%1:18:00:: and judges---judge%1:18:00:: - be limited as precisely and explicitly as possible ; that old customs---custom%1:09:00:: which inhibited trade---trade%1:04:05:: be abrogated ; that business---business%1:14:02:: be free from governmental supervision---supervision%1:04:00:: and notions---notion%1:09:02:: of morality---morality%1:07:00:: which might clog the automatic adjustments---adjustment%1:11:00:: of the free market---market%1:04:00:: ; that obligations---obligation%1:04:00:: of status---status%1:26:00:: that were inconsistent with the new politics---politics%1:09:00:: and the new economics---economics%1:09:00:: be done away with .
Contract---contract%1:10:00:: - conceived as the free bargain---bargain%1:10:00:: of formal equals---equal%1:18:00:: - replaced the implied obligations---obligation%1:04:00:: of a more static and status---status%1:26:00:: conscious society---society%1:14:00:: .
Indeed , contract---contract%1:10:00:: was the dominant legal theme---theme%1:10:00:: of the century---century%1:28:00:: , the touchstone---touchstone%1:10:00:: of the free society---society%1:14:00:: .
Government---government%1:04:00:: itself was based upon contract---contract%1:10:00:: ; business organization---business_organization%1:14:00:: - the corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: - was analyzed in contractual terms---term%1:10:00:: ; trade---trade%1:04:05:: was based on freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: of contract---contract%1:10:00:: , and money---money%1:21:00:: was lent and borrowed on contractual terms---term%1:10:02:: ; even marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: and the family---family%1:14:00:: was seen as a contractual arrangement---arrangement%1:09:01:: .
It is not surprising that the international obligations---obligation%1:04:00:: of states---state%1:14:00:: were also viewed in terms of contract---contract%1:10:00:: .
In fact , some - Anzilotti---person%1:03:00:: is the principle example---example%1:09:00:: - went so far as to say that all international law---international_law%1:14:00:: could be traced to the single legal norm---norm%1:24:00:: , Pacta sunt Servanda .
The displacement---displacement%1:04:00:: ( at least to a considerable extent---extent%1:07:00:: ) of the ethical jurisprudence---jurisprudence%1:09:00:: of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries---century%1:28:00:: by positivism---positivism%1:09:00:: reshaped both international law---international_law%1:14:00:: theory---theory%1:09:00:: and doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: .
In the first place the new doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: brought a formal separation---separation%1:11:00:: of international from municipal law---law%1:14:00:: , rejecting the earlier view---view%1:09:02:: that both were parts---part%1:24:00:: of a universal legal system---legal_system%1:09:00:: .
One result---result%1:19:00:: was to nationalize much---much%1:23:00:: that had been regarded as the law of nations---law_of_nations%1:14:00:: .
Admiralty law---admiralty_law%1:14:00:: , the law merchant---law_merchant%1:14:00:: , and the host---host%1:14:00:: of problems---problem%1:26:00:: which arise in private litigation---litigation%1:04:00:: because of some contact---contact%1:04:02:: with a foreign country---country%1:14:00:: were all severed from the older Law of Nations---law_of_nations%1:14:00:: and made dependent on the several national laws---law%1:14:00:: .
Private international law---international_law%1:14:00:: ( which Americans---american%1:18:00:: call the `` conflict---conflict%1:04:00:: of laws---law%1:14:00:: '' ) was thus segregated from international law---international_law%1:14:00:: proper , or , as it is often called , public international law---international_law%1:14:00:: .
States---state%1:14:00:: were free to enact , within broad though ( perhaps ) determinate limits---limit%1:07:00:: , their own rules---rule%1:09:00:: as to the application---application%1:04:02:: of foreign law---law%1:14:00:: by their courts---court%1:14:00:: , to vary the law merchant---law_merchant%1:14:00:: , and to enact legislation---legislation%1:10:00:: with regard to many claims---claim%1:04:00:: arising on the high seas---high_sea%1:17:00:: .
The change---change%1:24:00:: was not quite so dramatic as it sounds because in fact common norms---norm%1:24:00:: continued to be invoked by municipal courts---court%1:14:00:: and were only gradually changed by legislation---legislation%1:10:00:: , and then largely in marginal situations---situation%1:26:00:: .
Among the recipients---recipient%1:18:00:: of the Nobel Prize---nobel_prize%1:10:00:: for Literature---literature%1:04:00:: more than half---half%1:23:00:: are practically unknown to readers---reader%1:18:03:: of English---english%1:09:00:: .
Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers---reader%1:18:00:: of English---english%1:10:00:: .
Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries---discovery%1:10:00:: than Verner von Heidenstam---person%1:03:00:: , the Swedish poet---poet%1:18:00:: and novelist---novelist%1:18:00:: who received the award---award%1:21:00:: in 1916 and whose centennial---centennial%1:28:00:: was celebrated two years---year%1:28:01:: ago .
Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner von Heidenstam , the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award---award%1:10:00:: in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago .
Equally a master---master%1:18:00:: of prose---prose%1:10:00:: and verse---verse%1:10:02:: , he recreates the glory---glory%1:07:00:: of Sweden---sweden%1:15:00:: in the past---past%1:28:00:: and continues it into the present---present%1:28:00:: .
In the following sketch---sketch%1:10:03:: we shall present a brief outline---outline%1:10:00:: of his life---life%1:10:00:: and let him as much as possible speak for himself .
Heidenstam---person%1:03:00:: was born in 1859 , of a prosperous family---family%1:14:00:: .
On his father---father%1:18:00:: 's side---side%1:14:01:: he was of German descent---descent%1:07:00:: , on his mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's he came of the old Swedish nobility---nobility%1:14:00:: .
The family---family%1:14:00:: estate---estate%1:21:01:: was situated near Vadstena---location%1:03:00:: on Lake Va---location%1:03:00:: ^ ttern---location%1:03:00:: in south central Sweden---sweden%1:15:00:: .
It is a lonely , rather desolate region , but full of legendary and historic associations---association%1:26:02:: .
It is a lonely , rather desolate region---region%1:15:00:: , but full of legendary and historic associations---association%1:09:00:: .
As a boy---boy%1:18:00:: in a local school---school%1:14:00:: he was shy and solitary , absorbed in his fondness---fondness%1:12:01:: for nature---nature%1:17:00:: and his visions---vision%1:09:03:: of Sweden---sweden%1:15:00:: 's ancient glory---glory%1:07:00:: .
He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain---chieftain%1:18:01:: and to dress for the part---part%1:09:01:: .
Being somewhat delicate in health---health%1:26:00:: , at the age---age%1:07:00:: of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe---europe%1:17:00:: , for which he at once developed a passion---passion%1:12:00:: , so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years---year%1:28:01:: abroad , at first in Italy---italy%1:15:00:: , then in Greece---greece%1:15:00:: , Egypt---egypt%1:15:00:: , Asia Minor---asia_minor%1:15:00:: , and Palestine---palestine%1:15:01:: .
In one of his summers---summer%1:28:00:: at home---home%1:15:04:: he married , to the great disapproval---disapproval%1:12:00:: of his father---father%1:18:00:: , who objected because of his extreme youth---youth%1:26:00:: .
Deciding to become a painter---painter%1:18:00:: , he entered the studio---studio%1:06:00:: of Gerome---person%1:03:00:: in Paris---paris%1:15:00:: , where he enjoyed the life---life%1:26:01:: of the artists---artist%1:18:00:: , but soon found that whatever talent---talent%1:09:00:: he might have did not lie in that direction---direction%1:09:00:: .
He gives us an account---account%1:10:00:: of this in his lively and humorous poem---poem%1:10:00:: , `` The Happy Artists '' .
`` I scanned the world---world%1:09:00:: through printed symbol---printed_symbol%1:10:00:: swart , And through the beggar---beggar%1:18:00:: 's rags---rag%1:06:00:: I strove to see The inner man---man%1:18:04:: .
`` I scanned the world---world%1:17:01:: through printed symbol swart , And through the beggar 's rags I strove to see The inner man .
I looked unceasingly With my cold mind---mind%1:09:00:: and with my burning heart---heart%1:09:00:: '' .
In this final line---line%1:10:02:: , we have the key---key%1:09:00:: to his nature---nature%1:07:01:: .
Few writers---writer%1:18:00:: have better understood their deepest selves---self%1:09:00:: .
Heidenstam---person%1:03:00:: could never be satisfied by surface---surface%1:09:00:: .
It may , however , be noted that his gift---gift%1:09:00:: for color---color%1:07:03:: and imagery---imagery%1:09:00:: must have been greatly stimulated by his stay---stay%1:04:00:: in Paris---paris%1:15:00:: .
It may , however , be noted that his gift for color---color%1:07:04:: and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris .
The first result---result%1:19:00:: of Heidenstam---person%1:03:00:: 's long sojourn---sojourn%1:04:00:: abroad was a volume---volume%1:06:00:: of poems---poem%1:10:00:: , Pilgrimage and Wander Years ( Vallfart och vandringsar ) , published in 1888 .
It was a brilliant debut---debut%1:04:00:: , so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality---vitality%1:07:01:: in the younger poets---poet%1:18:00:: , as did Byron---person%1:03:00:: 's Childe Harold .
Professor Fredrik Bo---person%1:03:00:: ^ o ^ k , Sweden---sweden%1:15:00:: 's foremost critic---critic%1:18:00:: of the period---period%1:28:00:: , acclaims it as follows : `` In this we have the verse---verse%1:10:00:: of a painter---painter%1:18:00:: ; strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid .
Professor Fredrik Bo ^ o ^ k , Sweden 's foremost critic of the period , acclaims it as follows : `` In this we have the verse---verse%1:10:02:: of a painter ; strongly colorful , plastic , racy , vivid .
In a bold , sometimes careless , form---form%1:07:00:: there is nothing academic ; all is seen and felt and experienced , the observation---observation%1:10:00:: is sharp and the imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: lively .
The young poet---poet%1:18:00:: painter---painter%1:18:00:: reproduces the French life---life%1:26:01:: of the streets---street%1:26:00:: ; he tells stories---story%1:10:03:: of the Thousand and One Nights , and conjures up before us the bazaars---bazaar%1:06:00:: of Damascus---damascus%1:15:00:: .
In the care-free indolence---indolence%1:07:00:: of the East---east%1:15:00:: he sees the last reflection---reflection%1:10:01:: of the old happy existence---existence%1:26:00:: , and for that reason---reason%1:16:00:: he loves it .
And yet amid all the gay hedonism---hedonism%1:16:00:: in Pilgrimage and Wander-Years is a cycle---cycle%1:14:00:: of short poems---poem%1:10:00:: , '' Thoughts in Loneliness `` , filled with brooding---brooding%1:12:00:: , melancholy---melancholy%1:12:00:: , and sombre longing---longing%1:12:00:: '' .
Of the longer pieces---piece%1:06:00:: of the volume none is so memorable as `` Nameless and Immortal '' , which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language .

On the eve---eve%1:28:01:: of his return---return%1:04:01:: to their native Naxos---location%1:03:00:: he speaks with his wife---wife%1:18:00:: of the masterpiece---masterpiece%1:06:00:: which rises before them in its completed perfection---perfection%1:26:00:: .
The supreme object---object%1:09:00:: of their lives---life%1:26:02:: is now fulfilled , says the wife---wife%1:18:00:: , her husband---husband%1:18:00:: has achieved immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: .
Not so , he answers , it is not the architect---architect%1:18:00:: but the temple---temple%1:06:00:: that is immortal .
`` The man---man%1:18:04:: 's true reputation---reputation%1:26:00:: is his work---work%1:06:00:: '' .
`` The man---man%1:18:00:: 's true reputation is his work---work%1:04:00:: '' .
The short poems---poem%1:10:00:: grouped at the end---end%1:09:00:: of the volume---volume%1:06:00:: as `` Thoughts in Loneliness '' is , as Professor Bo---person%1:03:00:: ^ o ^ k indicated , in sharp contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: with the others .
It consists of fragmentary personal revelations---revelation%1:10:02:: , such as `` The Spark '' :
`` There is a spark---spark%1:07:00:: dwells deep within my soul .
`` There is a spark---spark%1:11:01:: dwells deep within my soul---soul%1:18:00:: .
To get it out into the daylight---daylight%1:28:00:: 's glow---glow%1:19:00:: Is my life---life%1:26:02:: 's aim---aim%1:09:01:: both first and last , the whole .
That little spark---spark%1:11:01:: is all the wealth---wealth%1:21:02:: I know , That little spark---spark%1:11:01:: is my life---life%1:26:02:: 's misery---misery%1:26:00:: '' .
That little spark---spark%1:07:00:: is all the wealth---wealth%1:26:00:: I know , That little spark---spark%1:07:00:: is my life 's misery '' .
A dominant motive---motive%1:03:00:: is the poet---poet%1:18:00:: 's longing---longing%1:12:00:: for his homeland---homeland%1:15:00:: and its boyhood---boyhood%1:28:00:: associations---association%1:09:00:: : `` Not men---man%1:18:04:: folk---folk%1:14:00:: , but the fields---field%1:15:00:: where I would stray , The stones---stone%1:17:00:: where as a child---child%1:18:00:: I used to play '' .
A dominant motive is the poet 's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations : `` Not men---man%1:18:00:: folk , but the fields---field%1:17:00:: where I would stray , The stones where as a child I used to play '' .
He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life---life%1:26:02:: he has been leading .
What he really wants is to find `` a sacred cause---cause%1:04:01:: '' to which he can honestly devote himself .
This restless individualism---individualism%1:07:00:: found its answer---answer%1:10:02:: when he returned to live nearly all the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of his life---life%1:26:02:: in Sweden---sweden%1:15:00:: .
His cause was to commemorate the glory---glory%1:26:00:: of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present .
His cause---cause%1:04:01:: was to commemorate the glory---glory%1:07:00:: of her past---past%1:28:00:: and to incite her people---people%1:14:01:: to perpetuate it in the present---present%1:28:00:: .
His next major work---work%1:06:00:: , completed in 1892 , was a long fantastic epic---epic%1:10:00:: in prose---prose%1:10:00:: , entitled Hans Alienus , which Professor Bo---person%1:03:00:: ^ o ^ k describes as a monument---monument%1:06:00:: on the grave---grave%1:06:00:: of his carefree and indolent youth---youth%1:28:00:: .
The hero---hero%1:09:00:: , who is himself , is represented as a pilgrim---pilgrim%1:18:00:: in the storied lands---land%1:15:02:: of the East---east%1:15:00:: , a sort of Faustus---person%1:03:00:: type---type%1:18:00:: , who , to quote from Professor Bo---person%1:03:00:: ^ o ^ k again , `` even in the pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: gardens---garden%1:14:00:: of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search---search%1:04:00:: after the meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: of life---life%1:09:00:: .
He is driven back by his yearning---yearning%1:12:00:: to the wintry homeland---homeland%1:15:00:: of his fathers---father%1:18:00:: in the forest---forest%1:17:00:: of Tiveden---location%1:03:00:: '' .
From this time---time%1:11:00:: on Heidenstam---person%1:03:00:: proceeded to find his deeper self---self%1:09:00:: .
By the death---death%1:11:00:: of his father---father%1:18:00:: in 1888 he had come into possession---possession%1:04:00:: of the family---family%1:14:00:: estate---estate%1:21:02:: and had re-assumed its traditions---tradition%1:09:02:: .
He did not , however , settle back into acquiescence---acquiescence%1:26:00:: with things---thing%1:26:00:: as they were .
Like his friend---friend%1:18:00:: and contemporary---contemporary%1:18:00:: August Strindberg---person%1:03:00:: he had little patience---patience%1:07:00:: with collective mediocrity---mediocrity%1:07:00:: .
He saw Sweden---sweden%1:15:00:: as a country---country%1:15:00:: of smug and narrow provincialism---provincialism%1:09:00:: , indifferent to the heroic spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: of its former glory---glory%1:07:00:: .
He saw Sweden as a country---country%1:14:01:: of smug and narrow provincialism , indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory---glory%1:26:00:: .
Strindberg---person%1:03:00:: 's remedy---remedy%1:04:00:: for this condition---condition%1:26:00:: was to tear down the old structures---structure%1:06:00:: and build anew from the ground---ground%1:17:00:: up .
Heidenstam---person%1:03:00:: 's conception---conception%1:09:00:: , on the contrary , was to revive the present---present%1:28:00:: by the memories---memory%1:09:02:: of the past---past%1:28:00:: .
Whether in prose---prose%1:10:00:: or poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: , all of Heidenstam---person%1:03:00:: 's later work---work%1:06:00:: was concerned with Sweden---sweden%1:15:00:: .
With the first---first%1:23:00:: of a group---group%1:03:00:: of historical novels---novel%1:10:00:: , The Charles Men ( Karolinerna ) , published in 1897 - 8 , he achieved the masterpiece---masterpiece%1:06:00:: of his career---career%1:04:01:: .
In scope---scope%1:07:00:: and power---power%1:07:00:: it can only be compared to Tolstoy---person%1:03:00:: 's War and Peace .
About one-third---one-third%1:23:00:: as long , it is less intimate and detailed , but better coordinated , more concise and more dramatic .
Though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure---figure%1:18:00:: of Charles 12 , , the true hero is not finally the king himself .
Though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure---figure%1:07:00:: of Charles 12---person%1:03:00:: , , the true hero---hero%1:18:00:: is not finally the king---king%1:18:00:: himself .
Hence the title---title%1:10:00:: of the book---book%1:10:00:: , referring to the soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: and subjects---subject%1:18:00:: of the king---king%1:18:00:: ; on the fatal battlefield---battlefield%1:15:00:: of Poltava---location%1:03:00:: , to quote from the novel---novel%1:10:00:: , `` the wreath---wreath%1:06:00:: he twined for himself slipped down upon his people---people%1:14:01:: '' .
The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative---narrative%1:10:00:: but of a group---group%1:03:00:: of short stories---short_story%1:10:00:: , each depicting a special phase---phase%1:28:00:: of the general subject---subject%1:10:00:: .
Somewhat uneven in interest---interest%1:07:02:: for an average reader---reader%1:18:00:: , eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind---kind%1:09:00:: in literature---literature%1:10:00:: .
They comprise a great variety---variety%1:14:01:: of scene---scene%1:26:00:: and interest---interest%1:09:00:: : grim episodes---episode%1:11:00:: of war---war%1:04:00:: , idyllic interludes---interlude%1:28:00:: , superb canvases---canvas%1:26:00:: of world-shaking events---event%1:03:00:: , and delightfully humorous sketches---sketch%1:10:03:: of odd characters---character%1:18:02:: .
The general effect---effect%1:09:00:: is tragic .
Almost nothing is said of Charles---person%1:03:00:: ' spectacular victories---victory%1:11:00:: , the central theme---theme%1:09:01:: being the heroic loyalty---loyalty%1:07:00:: of the Swedish people---people%1:14:01:: to their idolized king---king%1:18:00:: in misfortune---misfortune%1:26:00:: and defeat---defeat%1:11:00:: .
To carry out this exalted conception---conception%1:09:00:: the author---author%1:18:00:: has combined the vivid realism---realism%1:26:00:: and imaginative power---power%1:07:00:: we have noticed in his early poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: and carried them out on a grand scale---scale%1:24:00:: .
His peculiar gift---gift%1:09:00:: , as had been suggested before , is his intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: .
George Meredith---person%1:03:00:: has said that fervor---fervor%1:12:00:: is the core---core%1:09:00:: of style---style%1:10:00:: .
Of few authors---author%1:18:00:: is this more true than of Heidenstam---person%1:03:00:: .
The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters---character%1:09:01:: , of common folk even more than of major figures .
The Charles Men has a tremendous range---range%1:07:00:: of characters---character%1:18:02:: , of common folk---folk%1:14:00:: even more than of major figures---figure%1:18:00:: .
The career---career%1:04:01:: of Charles 12---person%1:03:00:: , is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon---napoleon%1:18:00:: .
His ideal was Alexander of Macedon---person%1:03:00:: , as Napoleon---napoleon%1:18:00:: 's was Julius Caesar---julius_caesar%1:18:00:: .
His purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: , however , was not to establish an empire---empire%1:15:00:: , but to assert the principle---principle%1:09:03:: of divine justice---justice%1:07:00:: .
His purpose , however , was not to establish an empire---empire%1:14:01:: , but to assert the principle of divine justice .
Each aspired to be a god---god%1:18:01:: in human form---form%1:03:00:: , but with each it was a different kind---kind%1:09:00:: of god---god%1:18:01:: .
Each failed catastrophically in an invasion---invasion%1:04:00:: of Russia---russia%1:15:02:: and each brought ruin---ruin%1:26:00:: on the country---country%1:14:01:: that worshipped him .
Each is still glorified as a national hero---hero%1:18:00:: .
The first half---half%1:23:00:: of The Charles Men , ending on the climax---climax%1:10:00:: of the battle---battle%1:04:00:: of Poltava---location%1:03:00:: in 1709 , is more dramatically coherent than the second .
After the collapse---collapse%1:26:01:: of that desperate and ill-fated campaign---campaign%1:04:00:: the character---character%1:18:02:: of the king---king%1:18:00:: degenerated for a time---time%1:28:00:: into a futility---futility%1:07:00:: that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous .
Like Napoleon---napoleon%1:18:00:: , he was the worst of losers---loser%1:18:01:: .
There are , however , some wonderful chapters---chapter%1:10:00:: at the beginning---beginning%1:09:00:: of the second part---part%1:24:00:: , concerning the reactions---reaction%1:09:00:: of the Swedes---swede%1:18:00:: in adversity---adversity%1:26:00:: .
Then more than ever before did they show their fortitude---fortitude%1:07:00:: and patient cheerfulness---cheerfulness%1:07:00:: .
This comes out in `` When the Bells Ring '' , which describes the rallying---rallying%1:04:00:: of the peasants---peasant%1:18:03:: in southern Sweden---sweden%1:15:00:: to repel an invasion---invasion%1:04:00:: by the Danes---dane%1:18:00:: .
In `` The King 's Ride '' , Charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia , regains his old self , escapes from Turkey , and finally reaches his own land---land%1:15:02:: after an absence of eighteen years .
In `` The King 's Ride '' , Charles---person%1:03:00:: breaks out of a long period---period%1:28:00:: of petulance---petulance%1:12:00:: and inertia---inertia%1:07:01:: , regains his old self---self%1:18:00:: , escapes from Turkey---turkey%1:15:00:: , and finally reaches his own land---land%1:15:01:: after an absence---absence%1:04:00:: of eighteen years---year%1:28:01:: .
He finds it in utter misery---misery%1:26:00:: and desolation---desolation%1:26:00:: .
All his people---people%1:14:01:: ask for is no more war---war%1:04:00:: .
But he plunges into yet another , this time---time%1:11:00:: with Norway---norway%1:15:00:: , and is killed in an assault---assault%1:04:00:: on the fortress---fortress%1:06:00:: of Fredrikshall---location%1:03:00:: , being only thirty-six years---year%1:28:01:: of age when he died .
He had become king---king%1:18:00:: at fifteen .
Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion---revulsion%1:12:00:: of popular feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: .
From being a hated tyrant---tyrant%1:18:00:: and madman---madman%1:18:00:: he was now the symbol---symbol%1:09:00:: of all that was noblest and best in the history---history%1:28:02:: of Sweden---sweden%1:15:00:: .
This is brought out in the next to last chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: of the book---book%1:10:00:: , `` A Hero 's Funeral '' , written in the form---form%1:09:00:: of an impassioned prose poem---prose_poem%1:10:00:: .
Slowly the procession of warriors---warrior%1:18:00:: and statesmen---statesman%1:18:00:: passes through the snow---snow%1:27:00:: beside the black water---water%1:17:00:: and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral---cathedral%1:06:00:: , the shrine---shrine%1:06:00:: of so many precious memories---memory%1:09:02:: .
The guns---gun%1:06:01:: are fired , the hymns are sung , and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors .
The guns---gun%1:06:00:: are fired , the hymns---hymn%1:10:00:: are sung , and the body---body%1:08:00:: of Charles---person%1:03:00:: is carried down to the vault---vault%1:06:01:: and laid beside the tombs---tomb%1:06:00:: of his ancestors---ancestor%1:18:00:: .
As he had longed to be , he became the echo---echo%1:07:00:: of a saga---saga%1:10:00:: .
Heidenstam---person%1:03:00:: wrote four other works---work%1:06:00:: of fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: about earlier figures---figure%1:18:00:: revered in Swedish memory---memory%1:09:00:: .
Excellent in their way---way%1:26:00:: , they lack the wide appeal---appeal%1:07:00:: of The Charles Men , and need not detain us here .
It is different with his volume The Swedes and Their Chieftains ( Svenskarna och deras ho ^ vdingar ) , a history intended for the general reader---reader%1:18:00:: and particularly suited for high school students .
It is different with his volume---volume%1:06:00:: The Swedes and Their Chieftains ( Svenskarna och deras ho ^ vdingar ) , a history---history%1:10:00:: intended for the general reader---reader%1:18:03:: and particularly suited for high school---high_school%1:14:00:: students---student%1:18:00:: .
Admirably written , it is a perfect introduction---introduction%1:10:01:: to Swedish history---history%1:28:02:: for readers---reader%1:18:00:: of other countries---country%1:14:01:: .
Some of the earlier episodes---episode%1:10:01:: have touches---touch%1:10:01:: of the supernatural---supernatural%1:18:00:: , as suited to the legendary background---background%1:26:00:: .
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlo---person%1:03:00:: ^ f .
Especially touching is the chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: , `` The Little Sister '' , about a king---king%1:18:00:: 's daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: who became a nun---nun%1:18:00:: in the convent---convent%1:06:00:: of St. Birgitta---location%1:03:00:: .
The record---record%1:10:02:: teems with romance---romance%1:07:00:: and adventure---adventure%1:04:00:: .
Gustaf Vasa---person%1:03:00:: is a superb example---example%1:09:00:: , and Charles 10---person%1:03:00:: , , the conqueror---conqueror%1:18:00:: of Denmark---denmark%1:15:00:: , hardly less so .
Of Gustavus Adolphus---person%1:03:00:: and Charles 12---person%1:03:00:: , it is unnecessary to speak .
Oersted---person%1:03:00:: 's boyhood---boyhood%1:28:00:: represented a minimal chance---chance%1:26:00:: of either attaining greatness---greatness%1:07:00:: or serving his people---people%1:14:01:: so well and over so long a span---span%1:28:00:: of life---life%1:28:00:: .
He was born in the small Danish town---town%1:15:00:: of Rudkoebing---location%1:03:00:: on the island---island%1:17:00:: of Langeland---location%1:03:00:: in the south central part---part%1:15:00:: of Denmark---denmark%1:15:00:: on August---august%1:28:00:: 14 , 1777 .
His father---father%1:18:00:: Soeren---person%1:03:00:: was the village---village%1:14:00:: apothecary---apothecary%1:18:00:: whose slender income---income%1:21:00:: made it difficult to feed his family---family%1:14:02:: , let alone educate them in a town---town%1:15:00:: without even a school---school%1:14:00:: .
The two older boys---boy%1:18:00:: , Hans---person%1:03:00:: and Anders---person%1:03:00:: , his junior---junior%1:18:00:: by a year---year%1:28:01:: , therefore went daily to the home---home%1:15:04:: of a warm and friendly wigmaker---wigmaker%1:18:00:: nearby for instruction---instruction%1:04:01:: in German---german%1:10:00:: ; his wife---wife%1:18:00:: taught the two boys---boy%1:18:00:: to read and write Danish---danish%1:10:00:: .
Other brothers---brother%1:18:00:: later joined them for instruction---instruction%1:04:01:: with Oldenburg---person%1:03:00:: , the wigmaker---wigmaker%1:18:00:: , and also arithmetic---arithmetic%1:09:00:: was added to Bible---bible%1:10:00:: reading---reading%1:09:00:: , German---german%1:10:00:: , and Danish---danish%1:10:00:: in the informal curriculum---curriculum%1:10:00:: .
Oldenburg---person%1:03:00:: 's contributions---contribution%1:21:00:: were soon exhausted and the boys---boy%1:18:00:: had to turn to a wider circle---circle%1:14:00:: of the town---town%1:14:00:: 's learned , such as the pastor---pastor%1:18:00:: , to supplement the simple teaching---teaching%1:04:01:: .
From the town---town%1:14:00:: surveyor---surveyor%1:18:00:: , Hans---person%1:03:00:: learned drawing---drawing%1:04:01:: and mathematics---mathematics%1:09:00:: and , from a university student---university_student%1:18:00:: , some academic subjects---subject%1:09:00:: .
The mayor---mayor%1:18:00:: of the town---town%1:14:00:: taught them English---english%1:10:00:: and French---french%1:10:00:: .
Whatever Hans---person%1:03:00:: or Anders---person%1:03:00:: learned separately they passed on to each other ; they read every book---book%1:10:00:: that they could borrow in the village---village%1:14:00:: .
At 12 , Hans---person%1:03:00:: was sufficiently mature to help his father---father%1:18:00:: in the apothecary---apothecary%1:18:00:: shop---shop%1:06:00:: , which helped stimulate his interest---interest%1:09:00:: in medicine---medicine%1:09:00:: and science .
His earlier love---love%1:09:00:: for literature---literature%1:09:00:: and history---history%1:09:00:: remained with him for his entire life---life%1:28:02:: .
In 1793 the brothers---brother%1:18:00:: decided to enter the University of Copenhagen---group%1:03:00:: ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring---spring%1:28:00:: found them at the university---university%1:06:00:: preparing to matriculate for the autumn---autumn%1:28:00:: session---session%1:28:00:: .
While Hans---person%1:03:00:: devoted himself to the sciences---science%1:09:00:: of medicine---medicine%1:09:00:: , physics---physics%1:09:00:: , and astronomy---astronomy%1:09:00:: , his brother---brother%1:18:00:: studied law---law%1:09:02:: .
The brothers---brother%1:18:00:: continued to help each other during their studies---study%1:09:03:: , sharing a joint purse---purse%1:21:01:: , lodging together in the dormitory---dormitory%1:06:00:: and dining together at the home---home%1:06:00:: of their aunt---aunt%1:18:00:: .
They supplemented their income---income%1:21:00:: by small government---government%1:14:00:: assistance---assistance%1:07:00:: , by tutoring and economizing wherever they could .
So impressive were those serious years---year%1:28:01:: of study---study%1:09:03:: at the university---university%1:06:00:: that Hans---person%1:03:00:: later wrote , `` to be perfectly free , the young man---man%1:18:00:: must revel in the great kingdom---kingdom%1:26:00:: of thought---thought%1:09:00:: and imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: ; there is a struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: there , in which , if he falls , it is easy for him to rise again , there is freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: of utterance---utterance%1:10:00:: there , which draws after it no irreparable consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: on society---society%1:14:00:: .
I lived in this onward driving contest---contest%1:04:00:: where each day---day%1:28:00:: overcame a new difficulty---difficulty%1:09:02:: , gained a new truth---truth%1:09:00:: , or banished a previous error---error%1:09:00:: '' .
He openly proclaimed his pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: in lecturing and writing about science .
In this third year---year%1:28:01:: at the university---university%1:06:00:: , Hans---person%1:03:00:: , in 1797 , was awarded the first important token---token%1:10:00:: of recognition---recognition%1:10:00:: , a gold---gold%1:21:00:: medal---medal%1:10:00:: for his essay---essay%1:10:00:: on `` Limits of Poetry and Prose '' .
He completed his training---training%1:04:00:: in pharmacy---pharmacy%1:09:00:: also , taking his degree---degree%1:10:00:: with high honors---honor%1:10:00:: in 1797 , and in 1799 was awarded the degree---degree%1:10:00:: of Doctor of Philosophy---doctor_of_philosophy%1:10:00:: along with a prize---prize%1:21:00:: for an essay---essay%1:10:00:: in medicine---medicine%1:09:00:: .
He proposed a fresh theory---theory%1:09:01:: of alkalis---alkali%1:27:00:: which later was accepted in chemical---chemical%1:27:00:: practices---practice%1:04:00:: .
Han---person%1:03:00:: 's student---student%1:18:00:: days---day%1:28:03:: were at a time---time%1:28:00:: when Europe---europe%1:17:00:: was in a new intellectual ferment---ferment%1:26:00:: following the revolutions---revolution%1:04:00:: in America---america%1:15:00:: and in France---france%1:15:00:: , Germany---germany%1:15:00:: and Italy---italy%1:15:00:: were rising from divisive nationalisms---nationalism%1:09:00:: and a strong wave---wave%1:11:02:: of intellectual awareness---awareness%1:09:00:: was sweeping the Continent---continent%1:15:00:: .
The new century---century%1:28:00:: opened with Oersted---person%1:03:00:: beginning his professional career---career%1:04:01:: in charge of an apothecary---apothecary%1:18:00:: shop---shop%1:06:00:: in Copenhagen---copenhagen%1:15:00:: and as lecturer---lecturer%1:18:01:: at the university---university%1:06:00:: .
He was stirred by the announcement---announcement%1:10:01:: of Volta---person%1:03:00:: 's discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: of chemical---chemical%1:27:00:: electricity---electricity%1:19:00:: and he immediately applied the voltaic pile---voltaic_pile%1:06:00:: to experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: with acids---acid%1:27:00:: and alkalis---alkali%1:27:00:: .
The following year---year%1:28:01:: he devoted to the customary `` Wanderjahr '' , traveling in Germany---germany%1:15:00:: , France---france%1:15:00:: , and the Netherlands---the_netherlands%1:15:00:: , meeting the philosophers---philosopher%1:18:00:: Schelling---person%1:03:00:: , Fichte---person%1:03:00:: , and Tieck---person%1:03:00:: .
He also met Count Rumford---person%1:03:00:: ( born Benjamin Thompson---person%1:03:00:: in Woburn, Mass---location%1:03:00:: . ) who was then serving the Elector of Bavaria---person%1:03:00:: , and the physicist---physicist%1:18:00:: Ritter---person%1:03:00:: ; these were Oersted---person%1:03:00:: 's main contacts---contact%1:18:00:: in science .
From Go---location%1:03:00:: ^ ttingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days---day%1:28:00:: , he wrote , `` The first question---question%1:10:00:: asked everywhere is about galvanism---galvanism%1:19:00:: .
As everybody is curious to see the battery---battery%1:06:00:: of glass---glass%1:27:00:: tubes---tube%1:06:02:: I have invented , I have had quite a small one made here of four glass---glass%1:27:00:: tubes---tube%1:06:02:: ( in Copenhagen---copenhagen%1:15:00:: I used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me '' .
Oersted---person%1:03:00:: joined Ritter---person%1:03:00:: at Jena---location%1:03:00:: and stayed with him for 3 weeks---week%1:28:00:: , continuing their correspondence---correspondence%1:10:00:: after he left .
With Ritter---person%1:03:00:: he was exposed to the fantastic profusion---profusion%1:07:00:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: that stormed through his host---host%1:18:02:: 's fertile but disorganized mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
Oersted---person%1:03:00:: remodeled Ritter---person%1:03:00:: 's notes---note%1:10:00:: into an essay---essay%1:10:00:: in French---french%1:10:00:: which was submitted to the Institut de France---group%1:03:00:: for its annual prize---prize%1:21:00:: of 3000 francs---franc%1:23:00:: .
The sound discoveries---discovery%1:09:00:: of this quixotic genius---genius%1:18:00:: were so diluted by those of fantasy---fantasy%1:09:01:: that the prize---prize%1:21:00:: was never awarded to him .
In May---may%1:28:00:: , 1803 , Ritter---person%1:03:00:: , in another flight---flight%1:09:00:: of fancy---fancy%1:09:01:: , wrote to Oersted---person%1:03:00:: a letter---letter%1:10:00:: that contained a remarkable prophecy---prophecy%1:10:00:: .
He related events---event%1:03:00:: on earth---earth%1:17:00:: to periodic celestial phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: and indicated that the years---year%1:28:00:: of maximum inclination---inclination%1:25:02:: of the ecliptic---ecliptic%1:15:00:: coincided with the years---year%1:28:00:: of important electrical discoveries---discovery%1:04:00:: .
Thus , 1745 corresponded to the invention---invention%1:09:00:: of the `` Leiden---leiden_jar%1:06:00:: '' jar by Kleist---person%1:03:00:: , 1764 that of the electrophorus---electrophorus%1:06:00:: by Wilcke---person%1:03:00:: , 1782 produced the condenser---condenser%1:06:01:: of Volta---person%1:03:00:: , and 1801 the voltaic pile---voltaic_pile%1:06:00:: .
Ritter---person%1:03:00:: proceeded , `` You now emerge into a new epoch---epoch%1:28:00:: in which late in the year---year%1:28:00:: 1819 or 1820 , you will have to reckon .
Ritter---person%1:03:00:: died in 1810 and Oersted---person%1:03:00:: not only lived to see the event---event%1:03:00:: occur but was the author---author%1:18:01:: of it .
In 1803 Oersted---person%1:03:00:: returned to Copenhagen---copenhagen%1:15:00:: and applied for the university---university%1:06:00:: 's chair---chair%1:04:00:: in physics---physics%1:09:00:: but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher---philosopher%1:18:00:: than a physicist---physicist%1:18:00:: .
However , he continued experimenting and lecturing , publishing---publishing%1:04:00:: the results---result%1:10:00:: of his experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: in German and Danish periodicals---periodical%1:10:00:: .
In 1806 his ambition---ambition%1:12:00:: was realized and he became professor---professor%1:18:00:: of physics---physics%1:09:00:: at the Copenhagen University---group%1:03:00:: , though not realizing full professorship---professorship%1:04:00:: ( ordinarius ) until 1817 .
During Oersted---person%1:03:00:: 's attendance---attendance%1:04:00:: at the university---university%1:06:00:: , it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: for experimenting in the sciences---science%1:09:00:: .
He was , however , fortunate in his contact---contact%1:04:02:: with Prof. J. G. L. Manthey---person%1:03:00:: ( 1769 - 1842 ) , teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: of chemistry---chemistry%1:09:00:: , who , in addition to his academic chair---chair%1:04:00:: , was also proprietor---proprietor%1:18:00:: of the `` Lion Pharmacy '' in Copenhagen---copenhagen%1:15:00:: where Oersted---person%1:03:00:: assisted him .
Manthey---person%1:03:00:: maintained a valuable collection---collection%1:14:00:: of physical and chemical apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: which was at Oersted---person%1:03:00:: 's disposal---disposal%1:07:00:: during and after his graduation---graduation%1:04:01:: .
In 1800 , Manthey---person%1:03:00:: went abroad and Oersted---person%1:03:00:: was appointed manager---manager%1:18:00:: of the Lion Pharmacy .
In February---february%1:28:00:: 1801 , Oersted---person%1:03:00:: did manage to experiment with physical apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: and reported experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: made with a voltaic battery---voltaic_battery%1:06:00:: of 600 plates---plate%1:06:02:: of zinc---zinc%1:27:00:: and silver---silver%1:27:00:: and of later experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: with a battery---battery%1:06:00:: of 60 plates---plate%1:06:02:: of zinc---zinc%1:27:00:: and lead---lead%1:27:00:: .
In the following year---year%1:28:01:: , 1803 , Oersted---person%1:03:00:: , simultaneously with Davy---person%1:03:00:: , discovered that acids---acid%1:27:00:: increased the strength---strength%1:07:08:: of a voltaic battery---voltaic_battery%1:06:00:: more than did salts---salt%1:27:00:: .
Eager as he was to pursue this promising line---line%1:09:01:: , he was so loaded down with the management---management%1:04:00:: of the pharmacy---pharmacy%1:06:00:: and lectures---lecture%1:10:00:: in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties---faculty%1:14:00:: at the university---university%1:06:00:: that he could devote only Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: afternoons---afternoon%1:28:00:: to `` galvanizing '' .
He assumed his academic career---career%1:04:01:: with the same intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: and thoroughness---thoroughness%1:07:00:: that had marked every step---step%1:04:02:: in his rise---rise%1:11:00:: from boyhood---boyhood%1:28:00:: .
The university---university%1:06:00:: was the only one in Denmark---denmark%1:15:00:: and the status---status%1:26:00:: of professor---professor%1:18:00:: represented the upper social level---level%1:26:01:: .
His broad interest---interest%1:09:00:: in literary , political , and philosophical movements---movement%1:04:03:: opened many doors---door%1:07:00:: to him .
His friends---friend%1:18:00:: were numerous and their ties---tie%1:26:01:: to him were strong .
The years---year%1:28:01:: 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany---germany%1:15:00:: and France---france%1:15:00:: again , but on this visit---visit%1:04:02:: to Berlin---berlin%1:15:00:: he did not seek out the philosophers---philosopher%1:18:00:: as he had on his first journey---journey%1:04:00:: .
In Berlin---berlin%1:15:00:: he published his views---view%1:10:00:: of the chemical laws of nature---law_of_nature%1:09:00:: in German---german%1:10:00:: and this was issued in French---french%1:10:00:: translation---translation%1:10:00:: ( Paris---paris%1:15:00:: , 1813 ) under the title---title%1:10:00:: Recherches sur l ' identite des forces chimiques et electriques , a work---work%1:06:00:: held in very high esteem---esteem%1:26:00:: by the new generation---generation%1:14:01:: of research---research%1:04:00:: chemists---chemist%1:18:00:: .
His interest---interest%1:09:00:: in finding a relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: between voltaic electricity---electricity%1:19:00:: and magnetism---magnetism%1:19:00:: is here first indicated .
Chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: 8 , is entitled `` On Magnetism '' and in it are included such remarks---remark%1:10:00:: as , `` One has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces---magnetic_force%1:19:00:: with the electrical forces---force%1:19:00:: .
The great resemblance---resemblance%1:07:00:: between electrical and magnetic attractions---magnetic_attraction%1:19:00:: and repulsions---repulsion%1:19:00:: and the similarity---similarity%1:07:00:: of their laws---law%1:09:01:: necessarily would bring about this comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: .
It is true , that nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: has been found comparable with electricity---electricity%1:19:00:: by communication ; but the phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: observed had such a degree---degree%1:07:00:: of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: that one could not find the slightest difference---difference%1:07:00:: .
The form---form%1:09:01:: of galvanic activity---activity%1:26:00:: is halfway between the magnetic form---form%1:09:01:: and the electrical form---form%1:09:01:: .
There , forces---force%1:19:00:: are more latent than in electricity---electricity%1:19:00:: , and less than in magnetism---magnetism%1:19:00:: .
But in such an important question---question%1:10:01:: , we would be satisfied if the judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: were that the principal objection---objection%1:10:01:: to the identity---identity%1:07:02:: of forces---force%1:19:00:: which produce electricity---electricity%1:19:00:: and magnetism---magnetism%1:19:00:: were only a difficulty---difficulty%1:09:02:: , and not a thing---thing%1:09:02:: which is contrary to it .
One could also add to these analogies---analogy%1:04:00:: that steel---steel%1:27:00:: loses its magnetism---magnetism%1:19:00:: by heat---heat%1:19:00:: , which proves that steel---steel%1:27:00:: becomes a better conductor---conductor%1:27:00:: through a rise---rise%1:11:00:: in temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: , just as electrical bodies---body%1:17:00:: do .
It is also found that magnetism---magnetism%1:19:00:: exists in all bodies---body%1:17:00:: of nature---nature%1:17:00:: , as proven by Bruckmann---person%1:03:00:: and Coulomb---person%1:03:00:: .
By that , one feels that magnetic forces---magnetic_force%1:19:00:: are as general as electrical forces---force%1:19:00:: .
An attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: should be made to see if electricity---electricity%1:19:00:: , in its most latent stage---stage%1:28:00:: , has any action---action%1:04:02:: on the magnet---magnet%1:06:00:: as such '' .
His plan---plan%1:09:00:: and intent---intent%1:09:00:: were clearly charted .
Oersted---person%1:03:00:: returned in 1814 and resumed an active part---part%1:04:01:: in university---university%1:14:00:: and political discussions---discussion%1:10:02:: .
In one debate---debate%1:10:01:: he supported the freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: of judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: as opposed to dogma---dogma%1:10:00:: , in another he held that the practice---practice%1:04:00:: of science was in fact an act---act%1:03:00:: of religious worship---worship%1:04:00:: .
He continued as a popular lecturer---lecturer%1:18:01:: .
He devised a detonating fuse---detonating_fuse%1:06:00:: in which a short wire---wire%1:06:01:: was caused to glow by an electric current---electric_current%1:19:00:: .
In 1819 under royal command---command%1:10:00:: he undertook a very successful geological expedition---expedition%1:04:00:: to Bornholm---location%1:03:00:: , one of the Danish islands---island%1:17:00:: , being one of three scientists---scientist%1:18:00:: in the expedition---expedition%1:14:00:: .
It was with the assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: of one of the members---member%1:18:00:: of this expedition---expedition%1:14:00:: , Lauritz Esmarch---person%1:03:00:: , that Oersted---person%1:03:00:: succeeded in producing light---light%1:19:00:: by creating an electric discharge---electric_discharge%1:19:00:: in mercury---mercury%1:27:00:: vapor---vapor%1:27:01:: through which an electric current---electric_current%1:19:00:: was made to flow .
Together they also developed a new form---form%1:09:01:: of voltaic cell---voltaic_cell%1:06:00:: in which the wooden trough---trough%1:06:00:: was replaced by one of copper---copper%1:27:00:: , thereby producing stronger currents---current%1:19:01:: .
Esmarch---person%1:03:00:: was among those who witnessed Oersted---person%1:03:00:: 's first demonstration---demonstration%1:04:00:: of his discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: .
The association---association%1:26:02:: between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces---force%1:19:00:: and magnetic forces---magnetic_force%1:19:00:: had been recognized by investigators---investigator%1:18:01:: for many decades---decade%1:28:00:: .
Electrical literature---literature%1:10:01:: contained numerous references---reference%1:10:02:: to lightning---lightning%1:19:00:: that had magnetized iron---iron%1:27:00:: and had altered the polarity---polarity%1:24:00:: of compass---compass%1:06:00:: needles---needle%1:06:01:: .
In the late 1700 's Beccaria---person%1:03:00:: and van Marum---person%1:03:00:: , among others , had magnetized iron---iron%1:27:00:: by sending an electrostatic charge---charge%1:19:00:: through it .
Beccaria---person%1:03:00:: had almost stumbled on a lead---lead%1:09:00:: to the relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: between electricity---electricity%1:19:00:: and magnetism---magnetism%1:19:00:: when a discharge---discharge%1:11:00:: from a Leyden jar---leyden_jar%1:06:00:: was sent transversally through a piece---piece%1:06:05:: of watch---watch%1:06:00:: spring---spring%1:06:00:: steel---steel%1:27:00:: making its ends---end%1:15:00:: magnetic .
The resulting magnetic effect---effect%1:19:00:: proved stronger than when the discharge---discharge%1:11:00:: was made lengthwise .
The experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: of Romagnosi---person%1:03:00:: and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause---cause%1:11:00:: and effect---effect%1:19:00:: relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: between these two primary forces---force%1:19:00:: .
Oersted---person%1:03:00:: 's own earlier experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: were unimpressive , possibly because he had , like other experimenters---experimenter%1:18:00:: , laid the conducting wire---conducting_wire%1:06:00:: across the compass---compass%1:06:00:: needle---needle%1:06:01:: instead of parallel with it .
The sequence---sequence%1:07:00:: of events---event%1:03:00:: leading to his important discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students---student%1:18:00:: at the university---university%1:06:00:: related that the first direct event---event%1:03:00:: that led to the publication---publication%1:04:01:: of Oersted---person%1:03:00:: 's discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: occurred during a private lecture---lecture%1:10:00:: made before a group---group%1:03:00:: of other advanced students---student%1:18:00:: in the spring---spring%1:28:00:: of 1820 .
At this lecture---lecture%1:10:00:: Oersted---person%1:03:00:: happened to place the conducting wire---conducting_wire%1:06:00:: over and parallel to a magnetic needle---magnetic_needle%1:06:00:: .
The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor---humor%1:07:01:: .
The letters---letter%1:10:00:: of the common soldiers---common_soldier%1:18:00:: are rich in humor---humor%1:10:00:: .
Indeed , no richer humor---humor%1:10:00:: is to be found in the whole of American literature---literature%1:10:00:: than in the letters---letter%1:10:00:: of the semi-literate men---man%1:18:00:: who wore the blue---blue%1:14:00:: and the gray---gray%1:14:00:: .
Indeed , no richer humor---humor%1:07:01:: is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray .
Some of their figures of speech---figure_of_speech%1:10:00:: were colorful and expressive .
A Confederate---confederate%1:18:02:: observed that the Yankees---yankee%1:18:02:: were : `` thicker than lise---louse%1:05:01:: on a hen---hen%1:05:01:: and a dam site ornraier '' .
Another reported that his comrades---comrade%1:18:00:: were `` in fine spirits---spirit%1:26:01:: pitching around like a blind dog---dog%1:05:00:: in a meat house---meat_house%1:06:00:: '' .
Another reported that his comrades were `` in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house---meat_house%1:06:01:: '' .
A third wrote that it was `` raining like poring peas---pea%1:13:00:: on a rawhide---rawhide%1:27:00:: '' .
Yanks---yank%1:18:02:: were equally adept at figurative expression---expression%1:10:04:: .
One wrote : `` [ I am so hungry ] I could eat a rider---rider%1:18:00:: off his horse---horse%1:05:00:: + snap at the stirups---stirrup%1:06:00:: '' .
A second reported that the dilapidated houses---house%1:06:00:: in Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: `` look like the latter end---end%1:09:00:: of original sin---original_sin%1:04:00:: and hard times---hard_times%1:28:00:: '' .
A third remarked of slowness---slowness%1:09:02:: of Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: : `` They moved about from corner---corner%1:15:02:: to corner---corner%1:15:02:: , as uneasy as a litter---litter%1:14:00:: of hungry leaches---leech%1:05:00:: on the neck---neck%1:08:00:: of a wooden god---god%1:18:01:: '' .
Still another , annoyed by the brevity---brevity%1:07:00:: of a recently received missive---missive%1:10:00:: , wrote : `` Yore letter---letter%1:10:00:: was short and sweet , jist like a roasted maget---maggot%1:05:00:: '' .
A Yankee---yankee%1:18:02:: sergeant---sergeant%1:18:01:: gave the following description---description%1:10:01:: of his sweetheart---sweetheart%1:18:00:: : `` My girl---girl%1:18:01:: is none of your one-horse girls---girl%1:18:00:: .
She is well-educated and refined , all wildcat---wildcat%1:05:00:: and fur---fur%1:27:00:: , and Union---union%1:15:00:: from the muzzle---muzzle%1:05:00:: to the crupper---crupper%1:06:00:: '' .
Humor---humor%1:10:00:: found many modes---mode%1:07:00:: of expression---expression%1:10:04:: .
A Texan---texan%1:18:00:: wrote to a male companion---companion%1:18:00:: at home---home%1:15:02:: : `` What has become of Halda---person%1:03:00:: and Laura---person%1:03:00:: ?
When you see them again give them my love---love%1:12:00:: - not best respects---respects%1:10:00:: now , but love---love%1:12:00:: by God '' .
William R. Stillwell---person%1:03:00:: , an admirable Georgian---georgian%1:18:00:: whose delightful correspondence---correspondence%1:10:00:: is preserved in the Georgia Department of Archives and History---group%1:03:00:: , liked to tease his wife---wife%1:18:00:: in his letters---letter%1:10:00:: .
After he had been away from home about a year---year%1:28:01:: he wrote : `` [ Dear Wife---wife%1:18:00:: ] If I did not write and receive letters---letter%1:10:00:: from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married I do n't feel much like a maryed man---man%1:18:00:: but I never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady---lady%1:18:02:: but if I should you must forgive me as I am so forgitful '' .
A Yank---yank%1:18:02:: , disturbed by his increasing corpulence---corpulence%1:07:00:: , wrote : `` I am growing so fat I am a burden---burden%1:06:01:: 2 myself '' .
Another Yank---yank%1:18:02:: parodied the familiar bedtime---bedtime%1:28:00:: prayer---prayer%1:10:01:: :
`` Now I lay me down to sleep , The gray-backs o ' er my body---body%1:08:00:: creep ; If they should bite before I wake , I pray the Lord---lord%1:18:02:: their jaws---jaw%1:08:00:: to break '' `` .
Charles Thiot---person%1:03:00:: , a splendid Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: , differed from most of his comrades---comrade%1:18:00:: in the ranks---rank%1:14:01:: in that he was the owner---owner%1:18:02:: of a large plantation---plantation%1:21:00:: , well-educated , and nearly fifty years---year%1:28:01:: of age .
But he was very much like his associates---associate%1:18:00:: in his hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: of camp---camp%1:06:00:: routine---routine%1:04:00:: .
Near the end---end%1:28:00:: of his service---service%1:14:00:: he wrote that when the war---war%1:26:00:: was over he was going to buy two pups---pup%1:05:00:: , name one of them `` fall-in '' and the other `` close-up '' , and then shoot them both , `` and that will be the end---end%1:26:00:: of ' fall-in ' and ' close-up '' ' .
The soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: who comprised the rank and file---rank_and_file%1:14:00:: of the Civil War---civil_war%1:04:00:: armies---army%1:14:00:: were an earthy people---people%1:14:00:: .
They talked and wrote much about the elemental functions---bodily_function%1:22:00:: of the body .
One of the most common of camp---camp%1:06:00:: maladies---malady%1:26:00:: was diarrhoea---diarrhoea%1:26:00:: .
Men---man%1:18:00:: of more delicate sensibilities---sensibility%1:12:00:: referred to this condition---condition%1:26:00:: as `` looseness of the bowels---looseness_of_the_bowels%1:26:00:: '' ; but a much more common designation---designation%1:10:00:: was `` the sh-ts---the_shits%1:26:00:: '' .
A Michigan---michigan%1:15:00:: soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: stationed in Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: wrote in 1864 : `` I expect to be tough as a knott---knot%1:27:00:: as soon as I get over the Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: Shitts---the_shits%1:26:00:: '' .
Johnny Rebs---johnny_reb%1:18:00:: from the deep South---deep_south%1:15:00:: who were plagued with diarrhoea---diarrhoea%1:26:00:: after transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: to the Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: front---front%1:15:01:: often informed their families---family%1:14:00:: that they were suffering from the `` the Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: quickstep '' .
A Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: gave his wife---wife%1:18:00:: the following description---description%1:10:01:: of the cause---cause%1:11:00:: and consequence---consequence%1:11:00:: of diarrhoea---diarrhoea%1:26:00:: : `` I have bin a little sick with diorah---diarrhea%1:26:00:: two or three days---day%1:28:00:: .
I eat too much eggs---eggs%1:13:00:: and poark---pork%1:13:00:: it sowered [ on ] my stomack---stomach%1:08:00:: and turn loose on me '' .
A Michigan---michigan%1:15:00:: soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: wrote his brother---brother%1:18:00:: : `` I am well at present with the exception---exception%1:09:00:: I have got the Dyerear---diarrhea%1:26:00:: and I hope thease few lines---line%1:10:02:: find you the same '' .
The letters---letter%1:10:00:: which poured forth from camps---camp%1:06:00:: were usually written under adverse circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: .
Save for brief periods---period%1:28:00:: in garrison---garrison%1:06:00:: or winter---winter%1:28:00:: quarters---quarters%1:06:00:: , soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: rarely enjoyed the luxury---luxury%1:07:00:: of a writing desk---writing_desk%1:06:01:: or table---table%1:06:01:: .
Most of the letters---letter%1:10:00:: were written in the hubbub---hubbub%1:11:00:: of camp---camp%1:06:00:: , on stumps---stump%1:20:00:: , pieces---piece%1:17:00:: of bark---bark%1:20:00:: , drum heads---drumhead%1:06:00:: , or the knee---knee%1:08:00:: .
In the South---south%1:15:01:: , after the first year---year%1:28:01:: of the war---war%1:26:00:: , paper---paper%1:27:00:: and ink---ink%1:27:01:: were very poor .
Scarcity---scarcity%1:07:00:: of paper---paper%1:27:00:: caused many Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: to adopt the practice---practice%1:04:00:: of cross writing---writing%1:10:01:: , i. e. , after writing from left---left%1:15:00:: to right---right%1:15:00:: of the page---page%1:10:00:: in the usual manner---manner%1:07:02:: , they gave the sheet---sheet%1:10:00:: a half turn---turn%1:04:07:: and wrote from end---end%1:15:00:: to end---end%1:15:00:: across the lines---line%1:10:02:: previously written .
Scarcity of paper caused many Southerners to adopt the practice---practice%1:09:00:: of cross writing , i. e. , after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner , they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written .
Sometimes soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: wrote letters---letter%1:10:00:: while bullets---bullet%1:06:00:: were whizzing about their heads---head%1:08:00:: .
A Yank---yank%1:18:02:: writing from Vicksburg---location%1:03:00:: , May---may%1:28:00:: 28 , 1863 , stated `` Not less than 50 balls---ball%1:06:03:: have passed over me since I commenced writing .
I could tell you of plenty---plenty%1:07:00:: narrow escapes---narrow_escape%1:04:00:: , but we take no notice---notice%1:09:00:: of them now '' .
A Reb---reb%1:18:00:: stationed near Petersburg---location%1:03:00:: informed his mother---mother%1:18:00:: : `` I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often , for you can see that very plainly by the blots---blot%1:07:00:: in this letter---letter%1:10:00:: .
Just count each blot---blot%1:07:00:: a dodge---dodge%1:04:00:: and add in a few for I do n't dodge every time---time%1:11:00:: '' .
Another Reb---reb%1:18:00:: writing under similar circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: before Atlanta---atlanta%1:04:00:: reported : `` The Yankees---yankee%1:18:02:: keep Shooting so I am afraid they will knock over my ink---ink%1:27:01:: , so I will close '' .
The most common type---type%1:09:00:: of letter---letter%1:10:00:: was that of soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: husbands---husband%1:18:00:: to their wives---wife%1:18:00:: .
But fathers---father%1:18:00:: often addressed communications---communication%1:03:00:: to their small children---child%1:18:01:: ; and these , full of homely advice---advice%1:10:00:: , are among the most human and revealing of Civil War---civil_war%1:04:00:: letters---letter%1:10:00:: .
Rebs---reb%1:18:00:: who owned slaves---slave%1:18:00:: occasionally would include in their letters---letter%1:10:00:: admonitions---admonition%1:10:01:: or greetings---greeting%1:10:00:: to members---member%1:18:00:: of the Negro---negro%1:18:00:: community .
Occasionally they would write to the slaves---slave%1:18:00:: .
Early in the war---war%1:26:00:: it was not uncommon for planters---planter%1:18:00:: ' sons---son%1:18:00:: to retain in camp---camp%1:06:00:: Negro---negro%1:18:00:: `` body servants---body_servant%1:18:00:: '' to perform the menial chores---chore%1:04:00:: such as cooking , foraging---foraging%1:04:00:: , cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: the quarters---quarters%1:06:00:: , shining---shining%1:04:00:: shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: , and laundering---laundering%1:04:00:: clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: .
Sometimes these servants---servant%1:18:00:: wrote or dictated for enclosure---enclosure%1:04:00:: with the letters---letter%1:10:00:: of their soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: masters---master%1:18:04:: messages---message%1:10:01:: to their relatives---relative%1:18:00:: and to members---member%1:18:00:: of their owners---owner%1:18:02:: ' families---family%1:14:00:: .
Unmarried soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: carried on correspondence---correspondence%1:10:00:: with sweethearts---sweetheart%1:18:00:: at home .
Owing to the restrained usages---usage%1:04:01:: characteristic of 19 th century---century%1:28:00:: America---america%1:15:00:: , these letters---letter%1:10:00:: usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth---depth%1:07:01:: of feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: .
Occasionally gay young blades---blade%1:18:00:: would write vividly to boon companions---companion%1:18:00:: at home about their amorous exploits---exploit%1:04:00:: in Richmond---richmond%1:15:00:: , Petersburg---location%1:03:00:: , Washington---washington%1:15:01:: , or Nashville---nashville%1:15:00:: .
But these comments---comment%1:10:00:: are hardly printable .
An Alabama---alabama%1:15:00:: soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: whose feminine associations---association%1:04:00:: were of the more admirable type---type%1:09:00:: wrote boastfully of his achievements---achievement%1:04:00:: among the Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: belles---belle%1:18:00:: : `` They thout I was a saint---saint%1:18:01:: .
I told them some sweet lies---lie%1:10:00:: and they believed it all .
I would tell them I got a letter---letter%1:10:00:: from home---home%1:15:02:: stating that five---five%1:23:00:: of my Negroes---negro%1:18:00:: had run away and ten---ten%1:23:00:: of Pappies---papa%1:18:00:: But I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten---kitten%1:05:00:: to a basin---basin%1:06:00:: of milk---milk%1:13:01:: '' .
Some of the letters---letter%1:10:00:: were pungently expressive .
An Ohio---ohio%1:15:00:: soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: who , from a comrade---comrade%1:18:00:: just returned from leave---leave%1:28:00:: , received an unfavorable comment---comment%1:10:00:: on the conduct---conduct%1:04:00:: of his sister---sister%1:18:00:: , took pen---pen%1:06:00:: in hand---hand%1:08:00:: and delivered himself thus : `` [ Dear Sis---sis%1:18:00:: ] Alf---person%1:03:00:: sed he heard that you and hardy---person%1:03:00:: was a runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse---use%1:07:00:: .

Initiation---initiation%1:11:00:: into combat---combat%1:04:00:: sometimes elicited from soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: correspondents---correspondent%1:18:00:: choice comments---comment%1:10:00:: about their experiences---experience%1:09:01:: and reactions---reaction%1:09:00:: .
A Federal infantryman---infantryman%1:18:00:: wrote to his father---father%1:18:00:: shortly after his first skirmish---skirmish%1:04:00:: in Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: : `` Dear Pa---pa%1:18:00:: .

Some of the choicest remarks---remark%1:10:00:: made by soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: in their letters---letter%1:10:00:: were in disparagement---disparagement%1:10:00:: of unpopular officers---officer%1:18:03:: .

Amid the crackle---crackle%1:11:00:: of small arms---small-arm%1:06:00:: and automatic weapons---weapon%1:06:00:: , I heard the thumping---thumping%1:11:00:: of mortars---mortar%1:06:00:: .
Then the lights---light%1:06:00:: went out .
This was my second day---day%1:28:00:: in Vientiane---vientiane%1:15:00:: , the administrative capital---capital%1:15:00:: of Laos---laos%1:15:00:: , and my thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: were none too brave .
Where was my flashlight---flashlight%1:06:00:: ?
To my room---room%1:06:00:: ?
Better stay in the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: lobby---lobby%1:06:00:: , where the walls---wall%1:06:00:: looked good and thick .
Chinese and Indian merchants---merchant%1:18:00:: across the street---street%1:06:00:: were slamming their steel---steel%1:27:00:: shutters---shutter%1:06:00:: .
Hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: attendants---attendant%1:18:00:: pulled parked bicycles---bicycle%1:06:00:: into the lobby---lobby%1:06:00:: .
A woman---woman%1:18:00:: with a small boy---boy%1:18:00:: slipped in between them .

The American newspaperman---newspaperman%1:18:00:: worried about getting to the cable---cable%1:10:00:: office---office%1:06:00:: .
But what was the story---story%1:10:01:: ?
Had the Communist led Pathet Lao---group%1:03:00:: finally come this far ?
Or was it another revolt---revolt%1:04:00:: inside Vientiane---vientiane%1:15:00:: ?
`` Let 's play hero---hero%1:18:00:: '' , I said .
`` Let 's go to the roof---roof%1:06:00:: and see '' .
By 7 : 50 the answer---answer%1:10:01:: was plain .
There had been an eclipse---eclipse%1:11:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: .
A traditional Lao explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: is that the moon---moon%1:17:01:: was being swallowed by a toad---toad%1:05:00:: , and the remedy---remedy%1:04:00:: was to make all possible noise---noise%1:11:00:: , ideally with firearms---firearm%1:06:00:: .
The din---din%1:04:00:: was successful , too , for just before the moon---moon%1:17:01:: disappeared , the frightened toad---toad%1:05:00:: had begun to spit it out again , which meant good luck---good_luck%1:26:00:: all around .
How quaint it all seemed the next day---day%1:28:00:: .
A restaurant---restaurant%1:06:00:: posted a reminder---reminder%1:10:00:: to patrons---patron%1:18:00:: `` who became excited and left without paying their checks---check%1:10:00:: '' .
But everyone I met had sought cover---cover%1:06:02:: first and asked questions---question%1:10:00:: later .
And no wonder---wonder%1:12:00:: , for Vientiane---vientiane%1:15:00:: , the old City---city%1:15:00:: of Sandalwood---location%1:03:00:: , had become the City---city%1:15:00:: of Bullet Holes---bullet_hole%1:17:00:: .
I saw holes---hole%1:06:00:: in planes---plane%1:06:01:: at the airport---airport%1:06:00:: and in cars---car%1:06:00:: in the streets---street%1:06:01:: .
Along the main thoroughfares---thoroughfare%1:06:00:: hardly a house---house%1:06:00:: had not been peppered .
In place---place%1:04:01:: of the police headquarters---police_headquarters%1:06:00:: was a new square---square%1:15:00:: filled with rubble---rubble%1:27:00:: .
Mortars---mortar%1:06:00:: had demolished the defense---defense%1:14:02:: ministry---ministry%1:06:00:: and set fire---fire%1:22:00:: to the American Embassy---embassy%1:06:00:: next door .
What had been the ambassador---ambassador%1:18:00:: 's suite---suite%1:06:00:: was now jagged walls---wall%1:06:00:: of blackened brick---brick%1:06:00:: .
This damage---damage%1:11:00:: had been done in the battle---battle%1:04:00:: of Vientiane---vientiane%1:15:00:: , fought less than three months---month%1:28:01:: earlier when four successive governments---government%1:14:00:: had ruled here in three days---day%1:28:00:: ( December---december%1:28:00:: 9 - 11 , 1960 ) .
And now , in March---march%1:28:00:: , all Laos---laos%1:15:00:: suffered a state---state%1:03:00:: of siege---siege%1:04:00:: .
The Pathet Lao forces---force%1:14:00:: held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more .
The Pathet Lao---group%1:03:00:: forces---force%1:14:01:: held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive---offensive%1:04:00:: in three more .
Throughout the land---land%1:15:01:: their hit-and-run terrorists---terrorist%1:18:00:: spread fear---fear%1:12:00:: of ambush---ambush%1:04:00:: and death---death%1:11:00:: .
`` And it 's all the more tragic because it 's so little deserved '' , said Mr. J. J. A. Frans---person%1:03:00:: , a Belgian official---official%1:18:01:: of the United Nations---group%1:03:00:: Educational , Scientific , and Cultural Organization---group%1:03:00:: .
We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with the U. N. flag---flag%1:10:01:: .
We talked after I hailed his Jeep---jeep%1:06:00:: marked with the U. N.---group%1:03:00:: flag---flag%1:06:00:: .
Practically all the people---people%1:14:01:: of Laos---laos%1:15:00:: , he explained - about two million---million%1:23:00:: of them - are rice---rice%1:20:00:: farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: , and the means---means%1:06:00:: and motives---motive%1:03:00:: of modern war---war%1:04:00:: are as strange to them as clocks---clock%1:06:00:: and steel---steel%1:27:00:: plows---plow%1:06:00:: .
They look after their fields---field%1:15:00:: and children---child%1:18:01:: and water buffaloes---water_buffalo%1:05:00:: in ten or eleven thousand villages---village%1:14:00:: , with an average---average%1:09:00:: of 200 souls---soul%1:03:00:: .
Nobody can tell more closely how many villages---village%1:14:00:: there are .
They spread over an area---area%1:15:01:: no larger than Oregon---oregon%1:15:00:: ; yet they include peoples---people%1:14:00:: as different from one another as Oregonians---person%1:03:00:: are from Patagonians---person%1:03:00:: .
`` What matters here is family---family%1:14:00:: loyalty---loyalty%1:07:00:: ; faith---faith%1:09:00:: in the Buddha and staying at peace---peace%1:26:01:: with the phis , the spirits---spirit%1:18:00:: ; and to live in harmony---harmony%1:07:01:: with nature '' .
Harmony---harmony%1:07:01:: in Laos---laos%1:15:00:: ?
`` Precisely '' , said Mr. Frans---person%1:03:00:: .
He spoke of the season---season%1:28:00:: of dryness---dryness%1:26:00:: and dust---dust%1:27:00:: , brought by the monsoon---monsoon%1:19:00:: from the northeast---northeast%1:24:00:: , in harmony with the season---season%1:28:00:: of rain---rain%1:19:00:: and mud---mud%1:27:00:: , brought by the monsoon---monsoon%1:19:00:: from the southwest---southwest%1:24:00:: .
The slim pirogues---pirogue%1:06:00:: in harmony with the majestically meandering Mekong River---mekong_river%1:17:00:: .
Shy , slender-waisted girls---girl%1:18:00:: at the loom---loom%1:06:00:: in harmony with the frangipani---frangipani%1:20:00:: by the wayside---wayside%1:06:00:: .
Even life---life%1:26:00:: in harmony with death---death%1:11:00:: .
For so long as death---death%1:11:00:: was not violent , it was natural and to be welcomed , making a funeral---funeral%1:11:00:: a feast---feast%1:11:00:: .
To many a Frenchman - they came 95 years ago , colonized , and stayed until Laos became independent in 1953 - the land---land%1:15:02:: had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti .
To many a Frenchman---frenchman%1:18:00:: - they came 95 years---year%1:28:01:: ago , colonized , and stayed until Laos---laos%1:15:00:: became independent in 1953 - the land---land%1:15:01:: had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti---tahiti%1:15:00:: .
Yet Laos---laos%1:15:00:: was now one of the most explosive headaches---headache%1:09:00:: of statesmen---statesman%1:18:00:: around the globe---globe%1:17:00:: .
The Pathet Lao---group%1:03:00:: , stiffened by Communist Veterans---veteran%1:18:00:: from neighboring North Viet Nam---viet_nam%1:15:00:: , were supplied by Soviet aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: .
The Royal Lao Army---group%1:03:00:: , on the other hand---hand%1:09:01:: , was paid and equipped with American funds---fund%1:21:00:: .
In six years---year%1:28:01:: , U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: aid---aid%1:21:00:: had amounted to more than $ 1.60 for each American---american%1:18:00:: - a total---total%1:09:00:: of three hundred million dollars---dollar%1:21:00:: .
We were there at a moment---moment%1:28:00:: when the situation---situation%1:26:00:: in Laos---laos%1:15:00:: threatened to ignite another war---war%1:04:00:: among the world 's giants---giant%1:14:00:: .
Even if it did not , how would this little world---world%1:14:01:: of gentle people---people%1:14:00:: cope with its new reality---reality%1:26:02:: of grenades---grenade%1:06:00:: and submachine guns---submachine_gun%1:06:00:: ?
To find out , we traveled throughout that part---part%1:15:00:: of Laos---laos%1:15:00:: still nominally controlled , in the daytime---daytime%1:28:00:: at least , by the Royal Lao Army---group%1:03:00:: : from Attopeu---location%1:03:00:: , the City---city%1:15:00:: of Buffalo---buffalo%1:05:02:: Dung---dung%1:27:00:: in the southeast---southeast%1:15:00:: , to Muong Sing---location%1:03:00:: , the City---city%1:15:00:: of Lions---lion%1:05:00:: in the northwest---northwest%1:15:00:: , close to Communist China---communist_china%1:15:00:: ( map---map%1:06:00:: , page---page%1:10:00:: 250 ) .
We rode over roads---road%1:06:00:: so rough that our Jeep---jeep%1:06:00:: came to rest atop the soil---soil%1:27:01:: between ruts---rut%1:25:00:: , all four wheels---wheel%1:06:00:: spinning uselessly .
We flew in rickety planes---plane%1:06:01:: so overloaded that we wondered why they did n't crash .
In the end we ran into Communist artillery fire---artillery_fire%1:04:00:: .
`` We '' were Bill Garrett---person%1:03:00:: of the National Geographic---group%1:03:00:: Illustrations Staff---group%1:03:00:: , whose three cameras---camera%1:06:00:: and eight lenses---lens%1:06:00:: made him look as formidable as any fighting man---man%1:18:03:: we met ; Boun My---person%1:03:00:: , our interpreter---interpreter%1:18:01:: ; and myself .
Boun My---person%1:03:00:: - the name---name%1:10:00:: means one who has a boun , a celebration---celebration%1:04:00:: , and is therefore lucky - was born in Savannakhet---location%1:03:00:: , the Border---border%1:15:00:: of Paradise---paradise%1:15:01:: .
Boun My - the name means one who has a boun , a celebration---celebration%1:11:00:: , and is therefore lucky - was born in Savannakhet , the Border of Paradise .
He had attended three universities---university%1:06:00:: in the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
But he had never seen the mountainous half---half%1:23:00:: of his native land---native_land%1:15:00:: north of Vientiane---vientiane%1:15:00:: , including the royal capital---capital%1:15:00:: , Luang Prabang---location%1:03:00:: .
Before the airplanes---airplane%1:06:00:: came , he said , travel---travel%1:04:00:: in Laos---laos%1:15:00:: was just about impossible .
To go outside the few cities---city%1:15:00:: required permits---permit%1:10:02:: .
and getting them seemed a life---life%1:28:02:: 's work---work%1:04:00:: .
Nobody wanted Americans---american%1:18:00:: to be hurt or captured , and few soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: could be spared as escorts---escort%1:18:01:: .
We were told that to the Pathet Lao---group%1:03:00:: , a kidnaped American---american%1:18:00:: was worth at least $ 750 , a fortune---fortune%1:21:00:: in Laos---laos%1:15:00:: .
Everyone had heard of the American contractor---contractor%1:18:00:: who had spurned an escort---escort%1:04:00:: .
Now Pathet Lao---group%1:03:00:: propagandists---propagandist%1:18:00:: were reported marching him barefoot from village---village%1:14:00:: to village---village%1:14:00:: , as evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: of evil American intervention---intervention%1:04:00:: .
Although we enjoyed our rounds---round%1:04:00:: of the government offices---government_office%1:06:00:: in Vientiane---vientiane%1:15:00:: , with officials---official%1:18:01:: offering tea---tea%1:13:00:: and pleasing conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: in French---french%1:10:00:: , we were getting nowhere .
We had nearly decided that all the tales---tale%1:10:00:: of Lao lethargy---lethargy%1:26:00:: must be true , when we were invited to take a trip---trip%1:04:00:: with the Prime Minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: .
We had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy---lethargy%1:07:00:: must be true , when we were invited to take a trip with the Prime Minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: .
Could we be ready in 15 minutes---15_minutes%1:28:00:: ?
His Highness---highness%1:18:00:: had decided only two hours---hour%1:28:00:: ago to go out of town---town%1:15:00:: , and he was eager to be off .
And so , after a flight---flight%1:04:00:: southeast to Savannakhet---location%1:03:00:: , we found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep---jeep%1:06:00:: right behind the Land-Rover---landrover%1:06:00:: of Prince Boun Oum---person%1:03:00:: of Champassak---location%1:03:00:: , a tall man---man%1:18:00:: of Churchillian mien---mien%1:07:00:: in a bush jacket---bush_jacket%1:06:00:: and a ten-gallon hat---ten-gallon_hat%1:06:00:: from Texas---texas%1:15:00:: .
From his shoulder bag---shoulder_bag%1:06:00:: peeked the seven inch---inch%1:23:00:: barrel---barrel%1:06:01:: of a Luger---luger%1:06:00:: .
The temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: rose to 105 ` .
With our company---company%1:14:03:: of soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: , we made one long column---column%1:25:02:: of reddish dust---dust%1:27:00:: .
In Keng Kok , the City of Silkworms , the Prime Minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: bought fried chickens and fried cicadas , and two notebooks for me .
In Keng Kok---location%1:03:00:: , the City---city%1:15:00:: of Silkworms---silkworm%1:05:01:: , the Prime Minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: bought fried chickens---chicken%1:13:00:: and fried cicadas---cicada%1:05:00:: , and two notebooks---notebook%1:10:00:: for me .
Then we drove on , until there was no more road---road%1:06:00:: and we traversed dry rice---rice%1:20:00:: fields---field%1:15:00:: , bouncing across their squat earth---earth%1:27:00:: walls---wall%1:06:00:: .
It was a spleen crushing day---day%1:28:04:: .
It was a spleen---spleen%1:08:00:: crushing day---day%1:28:00:: .
An hour---hour%1:28:00:: of bouncing---bouncing%1:11:00:: , a brief stop---stop%1:04:02:: in a village---village%1:15:00:: to inspect a new school---school%1:06:00:: or dispensary---dispensary%1:06:00:: .
More bouncing---bouncing%1:11:00:: , another stop---stop%1:04:02:: , a new house---house%1:06:00:: for teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: , a new well---well%1:06:00:: .
But our two Jeep---jeep%1:06:00:: mates---mate%1:18:04:: - Keo Viphakone---person%1:03:00:: from Luang Prabang---location%1:03:00:: and John Cool---person%1:03:00:: from Beaver---location%1:03:00:: , Pennsylvania---pennsylvania%1:15:00:: - were beaming under their coatings---coating%1:06:00:: of dust---dust%1:27:00:: .
Together they had probably done more than any other men---man%1:18:04:: to help push Laos---laos%1:15:00:: toward the 20 th century---century%1:28:00:: - constructively .
Mr. Keo---person%1:03:00:: , once a diplomat---diplomat%1:18:00:: in Paris---paris%1:15:00:: and Washington---washington%1:15:01:: , was Commissioner of Rural Affairs---person%1:03:00:: .
John---person%1:03:00:: , an engineer---engineer%1:18:00:: and anthropologist---anthropologist%1:18:00:: with a doctorate---doctorate%1:10:00:: from the London School of Economics---group%1:03:00:: , headed the rural development---development%1:04:01:: division---division%1:14:03:: of USOM---group%1:03:00:: , the United States Operations Mission---group%1:03:00:: administering U.

John , an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the London School of Economics , headed the rural development---development%1:04:02:: division of USOM , the United States Operations Mission administering U. S. aid---aid%1:21:00:: .
`` What you see are self-help---self-help%1:04:00:: projects---project%1:04:00:: '' , John---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` We ask the people---people%1:14:00:: what they want , and they supply the labor---labor%1:04:00:: .
We send shovels---shovel%1:06:00:: , cement---cement%1:27:00:: , nails---nail%1:06:00:: , and corrugated iron---corrugated_iron%1:06:00:: for roofs---roof%1:06:00:: .
That way---way%1:07:01:: they have an infirmary---infirmary%1:06:00:: for $ 400 .
We have 2500 such projects---project%1:04:00:: , and they add up to a lot more than just roads---road%1:06:00:: and wells---well%1:06:00:: and schools---school%1:06:00:: .
Ask Mr. Keo---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Mr. Keo---person%1:03:00:: agreed .
`` Our people---people%1:14:01:: have been used to accepting things---thing%1:26:00:: as they found them '' , he said .
`` Where there was no road---road%1:06:00:: , they lived without one .
Now they learn that men---man%1:18:04:: can change their surroundings---surroundings%1:26:00:: , through their traditional village---village%1:14:00:: elders---elder%1:18:00:: , without violence---violence%1:04:01:: .
That 's a big step---step%1:04:02:: toward a modern state---state%1:14:00:: .
You might say we are in the nation---nation%1:14:01:: building business---business%1:04:00:: '' .

The Prime Minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: paid his respects---respects%1:10:00:: to the Buddhist monks---monk%1:18:00:: , strode rapidly among the houses---house%1:06:00:: , joked with the local soldiery---soldiery%1:14:00:: , and made a speech---speech%1:10:01:: .

The soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: are fighting and the Americans---american%1:18:00:: are helping , he said , but in the fight---fight%1:04:01:: against the Pathet Lao---group%1:03:00:: the key factor---factor%1:09:00:: is the villager---villager%1:18:00:: himself .
We did it for three days---day%1:28:00:: .
We did it for three days---day%1:28:04:: .
But our stumping---stumping%1:04:00:: tour---tour%1:04:00:: of the south---south%1:15:02:: was n't all misery---misery%1:26:00:: .
Crossing the 4000 - foot---foot%1:23:00:: width---width%1:07:00:: of the Mekong---mekong%1:17:00:: at Champassak---location%1:03:00:: , on a raft---raft%1:06:00:: with an outboard motor---outboard_motor%1:06:00:: , we took off our dusty shirts---shirt%1:06:00:: and enjoyed a veritable ocean---ocean%1:17:00:: breeze---breeze%1:19:00:: .
Then we hung overboard in the water---water%1:17:00:: .
Briefly we rolled over a paved road---road%1:06:00:: up to Pak Song---location%1:03:00:: , on the cool Bolovens Plateau---location%1:03:00:: .
The Prince---prince%1:18:00:: visited the hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: of Operation---operation%1:04:03:: Brotherhood---brotherhood%1:12:00:: , supported by the Junior Chamber of Commerce---group%1:03:00:: of the Philippines---philippines%1:15:00:: , and fed rice---rice%1:13:00:: to two pet---pet%1:05:00:: elephants---elephant%1:05:00:: he kept at his residence---residence%1:15:00:: at Pak Song---location%1:03:00:: .

It takes place in the household---household%1:14:00:: , a rite---rite%1:04:00:: of well wishing---well-wishing%1:10:00:: for myriad occasions---occasion%1:11:01:: - for the traveler---traveler%1:18:00:: , a wedding---wedding%1:11:00:: , a newborn child---child%1:18:01:: , the sick---sick%1:14:00:: , the New Year---year%1:28:01:: , for any good purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: .
It takes place in the household , a rite of well wishing for myriad occasions - for the traveler , a wedding---wedding%1:04:00:: , a newborn child , the sick , the New Year , for any good purpose .
The preparations---preparation%1:04:02:: were elaborate : flowers---flower%1:20:02:: , candles---candle%1:06:00:: , incense---incense%1:27:00:: sticks---stick%1:06:00:: , rice---rice%1:20:00:: wine---wine%1:13:00:: , dozens---dozens%1:23:00:: of delicacies---delicacy%1:13:00:: , and pieces---piece%1:06:05:: of white cotton---cotton%1:27:01:: string---string%1:06:00:: .
The strings---string%1:06:00:: were draped around flowers---flower%1:20:02:: in tall silver bowls---bowl%1:06:01:: ( page---page%1:10:00:: 261 ) .
The candles were lighted , and we sat on split bamboo mats among the village---village%1:14:00:: notables .
The candles---candle%1:06:00:: were lighted , and we sat on split bamboo mats---mat%1:06:00:: among the village---village%1:15:00:: notables---notable%1:18:00:: .
I was careful to keep my feet---foot%1:08:01:: , the seat---seat%1:15:00:: of the least worthy spirits---spirit%1:18:00:: , from pointing at anyone 's head---head%1:08:00:: , where the worthiest spirits---spirit%1:18:00:: reside .
Now a distinguished old man---old_man%1:18:02:: called on nine divinities---divinity%1:18:00:: to come and join us .
Next he addressed himself to our souls---soul%1:18:00:: .
A man---man%1:18:04:: has 32 souls---soul%1:18:00:: , one for each part---part%1:24:00:: of the body---body%1:08:00:: .
Those souls---soul%1:18:00:: like to wander off , and must be called back .
With the divinities---divinity%1:18:00:: present and our souls---soul%1:18:00:: in place , we were wished health---health%1:26:00:: , happiness---happiness%1:26:00:: , and power---power%1:18:00:: .
Then , one after another , the villagers---villager%1:18:00:: tied the waiting cotton---cotton%1:27:01:: strings---string%1:06:00:: around our wrists---wrist%1:08:00:: .
These were to be kept on , to hold in the 32 souls---soul%1:18:00:: .
As we stepped out into the sunlight---sunlight%1:19:00:: , a man---man%1:18:00:: came up to John Cool---person%1:03:00:: and silently showed him his hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
It had a festering hole---hole%1:17:01:: as big as a silver dollar---silver_dollar%1:21:00:: .
We could see maggots---maggot%1:05:00:: moving .
John---person%1:03:00:: said : `` I have some antiseptic salve---salve%1:06:00:: with me , but it 's too late for that '' .
I guided her to the divan---divan%1:06:00:: , turned off the TV---tv%1:06:00:: , faced her .
She sat quietly , staring at me from the wide eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
And what eyes---eye%1:08:00:: they were .
Big and dark , a melting , golden brown---brown%1:07:00:: .
Eyes---eye%1:08:00:: like hot honey---honey%1:13:00:: , eyes---eye%1:08:00:: that sizzled .
Plus flawless skin---skin%1:08:00:: , smooth brow---brow%1:08:00:: and cheeks---cheek%1:08:00:: , lips---lip%1:08:00:: that looked as if you could get a shock---shock%1:04:00:: from them .
It was a disturbingly familiar face---face%1:07:00:: , too , but I could n't remember where we had met .
I said , `` Do we know each other , Miss---miss%1:18:00:: '' ?
`` No , I remembered reading about you in the papers---paper%1:10:03:: and that you lived here , and when it happened all I could think of was - '' .
This time---time%1:11:00:: she stopped the rush---rush%1:11:00:: of words---words%1:10:03:: herself .
It was her first smile---smile%1:10:00:: .
`` But one word---word%1:10:00:: at a time , O. K . '' ?
She was still hugging the stained coat---coat%1:06:00:: around her , so I said , `` Relax , let me take your things---things%1:21:00:: .
Would you like a drink---drink%1:13:04:: , or coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: '' ?
`` No , thanks---thanks%1:10:00:: '' .
She stood up , pulled the coat---coat%1:06:00:: from her shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: and started to slide it off , then let out a high-pitched scream---scream%1:10:00:: and I let out a low-pitched , wobbling sound---sound%1:10:01:: like a muffler---muffler%1:06:01:: blowing out .
She was wearing nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: beneath the coat---coat%1:06:00:: .
She jerked the coat---coat%1:06:00:: back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon enough .
There had been a good second---second%1:28:00:: or two during which my muffler---muffler%1:06:01:: had been blowing out , and now I was certain I 'd seen her somewhere before .
`` You may have seen me on TV---tv%1:10:00:: '' , she said .
`` I 've done several filmed commercials---commercial%1:10:00:: for - '' .
In fact , I was watching you on that little seventeen inch---inch%1:23:00:: screen---screen%1:06:05:: when you rang my bell---bell%1:06:02:: .
Man , you rang - it was in color , too , Miss---miss%1:18:00:: , and & & & Miss---miss%1:18:00:: ?
What 's your name---name%1:10:00:: , anyway ?
I sat by her on the divan---divan%1:06:00:: .
In a waterfall---waterfall%1:17:00:: and all that '' .
I do n't mean to pry , but do they hide the swimsuit---swimsuit%1:06:00:: with the bubbles---bubble%1:17:00:: ?
I mean : Is advertising---advertising%1:10:00:: honest ?
`` I really do have something important to tell you , Mr. Scott---person%1:03:00:: .
About the murder---murder%1:04:00:: '' .
`` Murder---murder%1:04:00:: ?
`` Tell me about the murder---murder%1:04:00:: '' .
ZING was the creation---creation%1:04:00:: of two men---man%1:18:00:: , Louis Thor---person%1:03:00:: and Bill Blake---person%1:03:00:: , partners---partner%1:18:00:: in ZING---group%1:03:00:: !
They 'd peddled the soap---soap%1:06:00:: virtually alone , and without much success---success%1:26:00:: , until about a year---year%1:28:01:: ago , when - with the addition---addition%1:04:02:: of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula---formula%1:10:02:: and the inauguration---inauguration%1:04:01:: of a high-powered advertising campaign---advertising_campaign%1:04:00:: - sales---sale%1:04:00:: had soared practically into orbit---orbit%1:15:00:: .
Their product---product%1:06:01:: had been endorsed by Good Housekeeping , the A. M. A. , and the Veterinary Journal , among other repositories---repository%1:06:00:: of higher wisdom---wisdom%1:09:02:: , and before much longer if you did n't have a cake---cake%1:06:00:: of their soap---soap%1:06:00:: in the john---john%1:06:00:: , even your best friends---friend%1:18:00:: would think you did n't bathe .
My lovely caller---caller%1:18:00:: - Joyce Holland---person%1:03:00:: was her name---name%1:10:00:: - had previously done three filmed commercials---commercial%1:10:00:: for ZING , and this evening , the fourth , a super production---production%1:10:00:: , had been filmed at the home---home%1:06:00:: of Louis Thor---person%1:03:00:: .
The water---water%1:27:00:: in Thor---person%1:03:00:: 's big swimming pool---swimming_pool%1:06:00:: had been covered with a blanket---blanket%1:17:00:: of thick , foamy soapsuds---soapsuds%1:17:00:: - fashioned , of course , from ZING - Joyce---person%1:03:00:: had dived from the board---board%1:06:00:: into the pool---pool%1:06:00:: , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath---bath%1:06:00:: '' while cameras---camera%1:06:01:: rolled .
The finished - and drastically cut - product---product%1:06:00:: would begin with a hazy longshot---longshot%1:06:00:: of Joyce---person%1:03:00:: entering the suds---suds%1:17:00:: , then bursting above the pool---pool%1:06:00:: 's surface---surface%1:06:00:: clad in layers---layer%1:06:00:: of lavender lather---lather%1:17:00:: , and I had a hunch---hunch%1:09:00:: this item---item%1:10:00:: was going to sell tons---tons%1:23:00:: and tons---tons%1:23:00:: of soap---soap%1:06:00:: ; even to clean men---man%1:18:00:: and boys---boy%1:18:00:: .
Joyce---person%1:03:00:: went on , `` When we 'd finished , Lou---person%1:03:00:: - Mr. Thor---person%1:03:00:: - asked me to stay a little longer .
He wanted a few stills---still%1:06:01:: for magazine---magazine%1:10:00:: ads---ad%1:10:00:: , he said .
Everybody left and I stayed in the pool---pool%1:06:00:: , then Lou---person%1:03:00:: came back alone and leaped into the pool---pool%1:06:00:: too .
And he did n't have any clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: on '' .
`` Did leap into the pool---pool%1:06:00:: , and did n't have anything on .
I would n't have the stuff---stuff%1:06:00:: in the house---house%1:06:00:: .
`` So I just scooted out of his clutches---clutches%1:04:00:: .
I swam like mad , got out of the pool---pool%1:06:00:: , grabbed my robe---robe%1:06:00:: , and ran to the car---car%1:06:00:: .
The keys---key%1:06:00:: were still in it , and I was miles---mile%1:23:01:: away before I remembered that my clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: and purse---purse%1:06:00:: and everything were still in the little cabana---cabana%1:06:00:: where I 'd changed '' .
She 'd driven around for a while , Joyce---person%1:03:00:: said , then , thinking Louis Thor---person%1:03:00:: would have calmed down by that time---time%1:11:00:: , she 'd gone back to his home---home%1:06:00:: on Bryn Mawr Drive---location%1:03:00:: , parked in front , and walked toward the pool---pool%1:06:00:: .
While several yards---yard%1:23:00:: from it , still concealed by the shrubbery---shrubbery%1:15:00:: , she 'd seen two men---man%1:18:00:: on her left at the pool---pool%1:06:00:: 's edge---edge%1:15:00:: .
`` A man---man%1:18:00:: was holding onto Lou---person%1:03:00:: , holding him up .
Maybe Lou---person%1:03:00:: was only unconscious , but right then I thought he must be dead .
The man---man%1:18:00:: shoved him into the water---water%1:27:00:: , then ran past the cabana---cabana%1:06:00:: .
There 's a walk---walk%1:06:00:: there that goes out to Quebec Drive---location%1:03:00:: .
I was so scared , well , I just ran to my car---car%1:06:00:: and came here '' .
`` You know who the other man---man%1:18:00:: was '' ?
`` No , I never did see his face---face%1:07:00:: .
I did n't get a good look---look%1:04:00:: at him at all , his back---back%1:08:00:: was to me , and I was so scared .
It was just somebody in a man---man%1:18:00:: 's suit---suit%1:06:00:: .
But I 'm sure the other one was Lou---person%1:03:00:: '' .
What Joyce---person%1:03:00:: wanted me to do was go to Thor---person%1:03:00:: 's house---house%1:06:00:: and `` do whatever detectives---detective%1:18:00:: do '' , and get her clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: - and handbag---handbag%1:06:00:: containing her identification---identification%1:10:01:: .
She realized I 'd have to notify the police---police%1:14:00:: , but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name---name%1:10:00:: .
Her impact---impact%1:04:00:: in the ZING commercials---commercial%1:10:00:: had led to her being considered for an excellent part---part%1:09:01:: in an upcoming TV---tv%1:10:00:: series---series%1:10:01:: , Underwater Western Eye , a documentary---documentary%1:10:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: show---show%1:04:00:: to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits .
But if Joyce---person%1:03:00:: got involved in murder---murder%1:04:00:: or salacious scandal---scandal%1:10:00:: , the role---role%1:09:00:: would probably go to the sponsor---sponsor%1:18:00:: 's wife---wife%1:18:00:: , Mrs. Oatnut Grits---person%1:03:00:: .
Or at least not to Joyce---person%1:03:00:: .
`` And I so want the part---part%1:09:01:: '' , she said .
`` The commercials---commercial%1:10:00:: have just been for money---money%1:21:02:: , there has n't been any real incentive---incentive%1:16:00:: for me to do them , but in Underwater Western Eye I 'd have a chance---chance%1:26:00:: to act .
But I promised Joyce---person%1:03:00:: I would mention her name---name%1:10:00:: , if at all , only as a last resort---last_resort%1:04:00:: .
Seeming much relieved , she smiled one of those worth waiting for smiles---smile%1:10:00:: , and I smiled all the way into the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: .
There I got my Colt---group%1:03:00:: Special and shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: harness---harness%1:06:01:: , slipped my coat---coat%1:06:00:: on , and went back into the front room---front_room%1:06:00:: .
Joyce---person%1:03:00:: squirmed a little on the divan---divan%1:06:00:: .
`` Yes , I 'm still all covered with that soap---soap%1:06:00:: .
I was loaded with suds---suds%1:17:00:: when I ran away , and I have n't had a chance---chance%1:26:00:: to wash it off .
`` You might as well wait here while I 'm gone , so you can use my shower---shower%1:06:00:: if you 'd like '' .
I showed her the shower---shower%1:06:00:: and tub---tub%1:06:01:: , and she said , smiling , `` If you really do n't mind , I think I 'll get clean in the shower---shower%1:06:00:: , then soak for a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: in your tub---tub%1:06:01:: .
I shook my head---head%1:08:00:: .
One of my virtues---virtue%1:07:03:: or vices---vice%1:07:00:: is a sort of three-dimensional imagination---imagination%1:09:02:: complete with sound effects---sound_effect%1:09:00:: and glorious living color---color%1:07:00:: .
`` Soak as long as you want , Joyce---person%1:03:00:: .
It 'll probably be at least an hour---hour%1:28:00:: or two before I can check back with you .
I looked at my watch---watch%1:06:00:: .
Time---time%1:28:06:: to go , I supposed .
`` Well , goodbye---good-bye%1:10:00:: '' , I said .
`` Goodbye---good-bye%1:10:00:: .
I 'll be soaking for at least half an hour---hour%1:28:00:: '' .
But suddenly those hot honey eyes---eye%1:08:00:: seemed to have everything but swarms---swarm%1:14:00:: of bees---bee%1:05:00:: in them .
However , when there 's a job---job%1:04:01:: to be done , I 'm a monstrosity---monstrosity%1:18:00:: of grim determination---determination%1:07:00:: , I like to think .
I spun about and clattered through the front room---front_room%1:06:00:: to the door---door%1:06:01:: .
As I went out , I could hear water---water%1:27:00:: pouring in the shower---shower%1:06:00:: .
Hot water---water%1:27:00:: .
She would n't be taking a cold shower---shower%1:04:00:: .
Bryn Mawr Drive---location%1:03:00:: is only two or three miles---mile%1:23:01:: from the Spartan---group%1:03:00:: , and it took me less than five minutes---minute%1:28:00:: to get there .
But the scene---scene%1:15:00:: was not the quiet , calm scene---scene%1:15:00:: I 'd expected .
Four cars---car%1:06:00:: were parked at the curb---curb%1:06:00:: , and two of them were police---police%1:14:00:: radio---radio%1:10:00:: cars---car%1:06:00:: .
Lights---light%1:06:00:: blazed in the big house---house%1:06:00:: and surrounding grounds---grounds%1:06:00:: .
I followed a shrubbery---shrubbery%1:14:00:: lined gravel path---path%1:04:00:: alongside the house---house%1:06:00:: to the pool---pool%1:06:00:: .
Two uniformed officers---officer%1:18:01:: , a couple of plain-clothesmen---plainclothesman%1:18:00:: I knew , and two other men---man%1:18:00:: stood on a gray cement---cement%1:27:03:: area---area%1:15:01:: next to the pool---pool%1:06:00:: on my left .
At the pool---pool%1:06:00:: 's far end---end%1:15:00:: was the little cabana---cabana%1:06:00:: Joyce---person%1:03:00:: had mentioned , and on the water---water%1:27:00:: 's surface---surface%1:15:00:: floated scattered lavender patches---patch%1:07:00:: of limp looking lather---lather%1:17:00:: .
A few yards---yard%1:23:00:: beyond the group---group%1:03:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: , a man---man%1:18:00:: 's nude body---body%1:08:02:: lay face---face%1:07:00:: down on a patch---patch%1:15:00:: of thick green---green%1:07:00:: dichondra---dichondra%1:20:00:: .
Lieutenant Rawlins---person%1:03:00:: , one of the plain-clothesmen---plainclothesman%1:18:00:: , spotted me and said , `` Hi , Shell---person%1:03:00:: '' , and walked toward me .
I grinned , but ignored the question---question%1:10:00:: .
He did n't push it ; Rawlins---person%1:03:00:: worked out of Central Homicide---location%1:03:00:: and we 'd been friends---friend%1:18:00:: for years---year%1:28:01:: .
A call---call%1:10:01:: to the police---police%1:14:00:: had been placed from here a couple of minutes---minute%1:28:00:: after nine p. m. , and the first police car---police_car%1:06:00:: had arrived two or three minutes---minute%1:28:00:: after that - 10 minutes---minute%1:28:00:: ago now .
Present at the scene---scene%1:15:00:: - in addition to the dead man---man%1:18:00:: , who was indeed Louis Thor---person%1:03:00:: - had been Thor---person%1:03:00:: 's partner---partner%1:18:00:: Bill Blake---person%1:03:00:: , and Antony Rose---person%1:03:00:: , an advertising agency---advertising_agency%1:14:00:: executive---executive%1:18:00:: who handled the ZING account---account%1:26:00:: .
Neither of them , I understood , had been present at the filming---filming%1:04:00:: session---session%1:04:00:: earlier .
I asked Rawlins---person%1:03:00:: .
`` They were supposed to meet Thor---person%1:03:00:: at nine p. m. for a conference---conference%1:14:00:: concerning the ad campaign---ad_campaign%1:04:00:: for their soap---soap%1:06:00:: , a new angle---angle%1:09:00:: based on this SX-21 stuff---stuff%1:27:00:: '' .
`` Yeah , I 've heard more about SX-21 than space---space%1:15:01:: exploration---exploration%1:04:02:: lately .
It 's a secret---secret%1:10:00:: .
That was the new advertising---advertising%1:10:00:: angle---angle%1:09:00:: - something about a Lloyd's of London---group%1:03:00:: policy---policy%1:10:02:: to insure the secrecy---secrecy%1:07:02:: of the secret ingredient---ingredient%1:06:00:: .
Actually , only two men---man%1:18:00:: know what the formula---formula%1:10:02:: is , Blake---person%1:03:00:: and '' - He stopped and looked at Thor---person%1:03:00:: 's body---body%1:08:02:: .
I said , `` O. K. , so now only Blake---person%1:03:00:: knows .
Deputy coroner---coroner%1:18:00:: says it looks like he sucked in a big pile---pile%1:14:00:: of those thick suds---suds%1:17:00:: and strangled on ' em .
The PM---pm%1:04:00:: might show he drowned instead , but that 's what the once-over-lightly gives us .
Accident---accident%1:11:01:: , murder---murder%1:04:00:: , suicide---suicide%1:04:00:: - take your pick---pick%1:09:00:: '' .
`` I 'll pick murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
`` According to Rose---person%1:03:00:: , he arrived here a couple---couple%1:23:01:: minutes---minute%1:28:00:: before nine and spotted Thor---person%1:03:00:: in the water---water%1:27:00:: , got a hooked pole---pole%1:06:00:: from the pool---pool%1:06:00:: equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: locker---locker%1:06:00:: and started hauling him out .
It is not a medieval mental quirk---quirk%1:07:00:: or an attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: `` unnourished by sense---sense%1:09:04:: '' to believe that husbands---husband%1:18:00:: and wives---wife%1:18:00:: should not be subjected to such a risk---risk%1:26:00:: , or that such a possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality---confidentiality%1:26:00:: of the marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: relationship---relationship%1:26:00:: .
While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins---person%1:03:00:: ' pronouncement---pronouncement%1:10:00:: in Pleas of the Crown from a metaphysical point of view---point_of_view%1:09:00:: , the concept---concept%1:09:00:: of the `` oneness---oneness%1:07:00:: '' of a married couple---married_couple%1:14:00:: may reflect an abiding belief---belief%1:09:00:: that the communion---communion%1:10:00:: between husband---husband%1:18:00:: and wife---wife%1:18:00:: is such that their actions---action%1:04:02:: are not always to be regarded by the criminal law---criminal_law%1:10:00:: as if there were no marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: .
By making inroads---inroad%1:04:01:: in the name---name%1:04:00:: of law enforcement---law_enforcement%1:04:00:: into the protection---protection%1:04:00:: which Congress---congress%1:14:01:: has afforded to the marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: relationship---relationship%1:26:00:: , the Court---court%1:14:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: continues in the path---path%1:04:00:: charted by the recent decision---decision%1:09:00:: in Wyatt v. United States , 362 U. S. 525 , where the Court---court%1:14:00:: held that , under the circumstances of that case---case%1:04:00:: , a wife---wife%1:18:00:: could be compelled to testify against her husband---husband%1:18:00:: over her objection---objection%1:04:01:: .
One need not waver in his belief---belief%1:09:00:: in virile law enforcement---law_enforcement%1:04:00:: to insist that there are other things---thing%1:09:00:: in American life---life%1:26:01:: which are also of great importance---importance%1:07:00:: , and to which even law enforcement---law_enforcement%1:04:00:: must accommodate itself .
One of these is the solidarity---solidarity%1:07:00:: and the confidential relationship---relationship%1:26:00:: of marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: .
The Court 's opinion---opinion%1:04:01:: dogmatically asserts that the husband wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality into a rule---rule%1:09:00:: of law '' .
The Court---court%1:14:00:: 's opinion---opinion%1:10:00:: dogmatically asserts that the husband---husband%1:18:00:: wife---wife%1:18:00:: conspiracy---conspiracy%1:14:00:: doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: does not in fact protect this relationship---relationship%1:26:00:: , and that hence the doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: `` enthrone [ s ] an unreality---unreality%1:07:00:: into a rule---rule%1:10:00:: of law---law%1:10:00:: '' .
I am not easily persuaded that a rule---rule%1:10:00:: accepted by so many people---people%1:14:00:: for so many centuries---century%1:28:00:: can be so lightly dismissed .
But in any event , I submit that the power---power%1:07:00:: to depose belongs to Congress---congress%1:14:01:: , not to this Court---court%1:14:00:: .
Petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: , who claims to be a conscientious objector---conscientious_objector%1:18:00:: , was convicted of violating 12 ( a ) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act by refusing to be inducted into the armed forces---armed_forces%1:14:00:: .
He claims that he was denied due process of law---due_process_of_law%1:04:00:: in violation---violation%1:04:04:: of the Fifth Amendment , because ( 1 ) at a hearing---hearing%1:04:01:: before a hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: of the Department of Justice ,---group%1:03:00:: he was not permitted to rebut statements---statement%1:10:00:: attributed to him by the local board---board%1:14:00:: , and ( 2 ) at the trial , he was denied the right---right%1:07:00:: to have the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: 's report---report%1:10:03:: and the original report---report%1:10:03:: of the Federal Bureau of Investigation---group%1:03:00:: as to his claim---claim%1:10:02:: .
Held : On the record---record%1:10:03:: in this case---case%1:04:00:: , the administrative procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: prescribed by the Act were fully complied with ; petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: was not denied due process---due_process%1:04:00:: ; and his conviction---conviction%1:04:00:: is sustained .
Petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: was not denied due process---due_process%1:04:00:: in the administrative proceedings---proceedings%1:04:00:: , because the statement---statement%1:10:00:: in question was in his file---file%1:10:00:: , to which he had access---access%1:07:01:: , and he had opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: to rebut it both before the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: of the Department of Justice---group%1:03:00:: and before the appeal board---appeal_board%1:14:00:: .
Petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: was not entitled to have the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: 's notes---note%1:10:00:: and report---report%1:10:03:: , especially since he failed to show any particular need---need%1:26:00:: for them and he did have a copy---copy%1:10:00:: of the Department of Justice---group%1:03:00:: 's recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: to the appeal board---appeal_board%1:14:00:: .
Petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: was not entitled , either in the administrative hearing---hearing%1:04:01:: at the Department of Justice---group%1:03:00:: or at his trial , to inspect the original report---report%1:10:03:: of the Federal Bureau of Investigation---group%1:03:00:: , since he was furnished a resume---resume%1:10:00:: of it , did not challenge its accuracy---accuracy%1:07:02:: , and showed no particular need---need%1:26:00:: for the original report---report%1:10:03:: .
Haydn C. Covington---person%1:03:00:: argued the cause---cause%1:04:00:: and filed a brief---brief%1:10:01:: for petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: .
Daniel M. Friedman---person%1:03:00:: argued the cause---cause%1:04:00:: for the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: .
On the brief---brief%1:10:01:: were Solicitor General Rankin---person%1:03:00:: , Assistant Attorney General Wilkey---person%1:03:00:: , Beatrice Rosenberg---person%1:03:00:: and J. F. Bishop---person%1:03:00:: .
Mr. Justice Clark---person%1:03:00:: delivered the opinion---opinion%1:10:00:: of the Court---court%1:14:00:: .
This is a prosecution---prosecution%1:04:00:: for refusal---refusal%1:10:01:: to be inducted into the armed services---armed_service%1:14:00:: , in violation---violation%1:04:00:: of the provisions---provision%1:10:00:: of the Universal Military Training and Service Act , 62 Stat. 604 , 622 , 50 U. S. C. App. 462 ( a ) .
Petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: , who claims to be a conscientious objector---conscientious_objector%1:18:00:: , contends that he was denied due process---due_process%1:04:00:: , both in the proceedings---proceedings%1:04:00:: before a hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: of the Department of Justice---group%1:03:00:: and at trial .
He says that he was not permitted to rebut before the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: statements---statement%1:10:00:: attributed to him by the local board---board%1:14:00:: , and , further , that he was denied at trial the right---right%1:07:00:: to have the Department of Justice---group%1:03:00:: hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: 's report---report%1:10:03:: and the original report---report%1:10:03:: of the Federal Bureau of Investigation---group%1:03:00:: as to his claim---claim%1:10:02:: - all in violation---violation%1:04:04:: of the Fifth Amendment .
The trial judge---trial_judge%1:18:00:: decided that the administrative procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: of the Act were fully complied with and refused to require the production---production%1:04:01:: of such documents---document%1:10:00:: .
Petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: was found guilty and sentenced to 15 months---month%1:28:01:: ' imprisonment---imprisonment%1:04:01:: .
The Court of Appeals---group%1:03:00:: affirmed .
We granted certiorari---certiorari%1:10:00:: in view---view%1:09:02:: of the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of the questions---question%1:10:01:: in the administration---administration%1:04:00:: of the Act .
We have concluded that petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: 's claims---claim%1:10:02:: are controlled by the rationale---rationale%1:09:00:: of gonzales v. United States , 348 U. S. 407 ( 1955 ) , and United States v. Nugent , 346 U. S .1 ( 1953 ) , and therefore affirm the judgment---judgment%1:04:00:: .
Petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: registered with Local Board No. 9---group%1:03:00:: , Boulder , Colorado---location%1:03:00:: , on March---march%1:28:00:: 17 , 1952 .
His answers---answer%1:10:01:: to the classification---classification%1:04:00:: questionnaire---questionnaire%1:10:00:: reflected that he was a minister---minister%1:18:00:: of Jehovah's Witnesses---group%1:03:00:: , employed at night---night%1:28:00:: by a sugar---sugar%1:13:00:: producer---producer%1:18:01:: .
He claimed 4 , - D classification---classification%1:14:00:: as a minister---minister%1:18:00:: of religion---religion%1:14:00:: , devoting a minimum---minimum%1:23:00:: of 100 hours---hour%1:28:00:: a month---month%1:28:01:: to preaching---preaching%1:10:00:: .
On November---november%1:28:00:: 13 , 1952 , he was classified in Class---class%1:14:00:: 1 , - A .
On November---november%1:28:00:: 22 , 1952 , he wrote the Board---group%1:03:00:: , protesting this classification---classification%1:04:00:: .
He again stated that he was `` a regular minister---minister%1:18:00:: '' ; that he was `` devoting an average---average%1:09:00:: of 100 hours---hour%1:28:00:: a month---month%1:28:01:: to actual preaching publicly '' , in addition to 50 to 75 hours---hour%1:28:00:: in other ministerial duties---duty%1:04:02:: , and that he opposed war---war%1:04:00:: in any form---form%1:09:01:: .
On April---april%1:28:00:: 1 , 1953 , after some six months---month%1:28:01:: of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: discontinued devoting 100 hours---hour%1:28:00:: a month---month%1:28:01:: to preaching---preaching%1:10:00:: , but failed to so notify his local board---board%1:14:00:: .
In a periodic review---review%1:04:00:: , the local board---board%1:14:00:: on July---july%1:28:00:: 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1 , - A and upheld this classification---classification%1:04:00:: after a personal appearance---appearance%1:04:01:: by petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: , because of his willingness---willingness%1:07:00:: to kill in defense---defense%1:04:03:: of his church---church%1:14:00:: and home---home%1:15:04:: .
Upon administrative approval---approval%1:04:02:: of the reclassification---reclassification%1:04:00:: , he was ordered to report for induction---induction%1:11:00:: on June---june%1:28:00:: 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so .
He was not prosecuted , however , and his case---case%1:04:00:: was subsequently reopened , in the light---light%1:09:01:: of Sicurella v. United States , 348 U. S. 385 ( 1955 ) .
He was again reclassified 1 , - A by the local board---board%1:14:00:: .
There followed a customary Department of Justice---group%1:03:00:: hearing---hearing%1:04:01:: , at which petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: appeared .
In his report---report%1:10:03:: to the Attorney General---person%1:03:00:: , the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: suggested that the petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: be exempt only from combatant training---training%1:04:00:: and service---service%1:14:00:: .
On March---march%1:28:00:: 21 , 1957 , however , the Department---group%1:03:00:: recommended approval---approval%1:04:02:: of the 1 , - A classification---classification%1:04:00:: .
Its ground---ground%1:16:00:: for this recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: was that , while petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: claimed before the local board---board%1:14:00:: August---august%1:28:00:: 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its memorandum---memorandum%1:10:00:: in his file---file%1:10:00:: of that date---date%1:28:00:: ) , that he was devoting 100 hours---hour%1:28:00:: per month---month%1:28:01:: to actual preaching---preaching%1:10:00:: , the headquarters---headquarters%1:06:01:: of the Jehovah's Witnesses---group%1:03:00:: reported that he was no longer doing so and , on the contrary , had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible Student Servant positions---position%1:04:01:: .
It reported that he now devoted only some 6 - 1 2 hours---hour%1:28:00:: per month---month%1:28:01:: to public preaching---preaching%1:10:00:: and from 20 to 25 hours---hour%1:28:00:: per month---month%1:28:01:: to church---church%1:14:00:: activities---activity%1:04:00:: .
His claim---claim%1:10:02:: was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' , the Department---group%1:03:00:: concluded , that it `` cast doubt---doubt%1:07:00:: upon his veracity---veracity%1:07:00:: and , consequently , upon his sincerity---sincerity%1:07:00:: and good faith---good_faith%1:07:00:: '' .
The appeal board---appeal_board%1:14:00:: furnished petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: a copy---copy%1:10:00:: of the recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: .
In his answer---answer%1:10:01:: thereto , he advised the Board---board%1:14:00:: that he had made no such statement---statement%1:10:00:: in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim---claim%1:10:02:: to `` pioneering '' was in 1952 .
The appeal board---appeal_board%1:14:00:: , however , unanimously concurred in the Department---group%1:03:00:: 's recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: .
Upon return---return%1:04:02:: of the file---file%1:10:00:: to the local board---board%1:14:00:: , petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: was again ordered to report for induction---induction%1:11:00:: and this prosecution---prosecution%1:04:00:: followed his failure---failure%1:04:01:: to do so .
Petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: first contends that the Department---group%1:03:00:: denied him procedural due process---due_process%1:04:00:: by not giving him timely opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: , before its final recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: to the appeal board---appeal_board%1:14:00:: , to answer the statement---statement%1:10:00:: of the local board---board%1:14:00:: as to his claim---claim%1:10:02:: of devoting 100 hours---hour%1:28:00:: to actual preaching---preaching%1:10:00:: .
But the statement---statement%1:10:00:: of the local board---board%1:14:00:: attributing this claim---claim%1:10:02:: to petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: was in his file---file%1:10:00:: .
He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times---time%1:28:05:: , and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: .
This he failed to do , asserting that he did not know it to be in his file---file%1:10:00:: .
Apparently he never took the trouble---trouble%1:04:02:: to find out .
Nevertheless he had ample opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to contest the statement---statement%1:10:00:: before the appeal board---appeal_board%1:14:00:: .
After the recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: of the Department---group%1:03:00:: is forwarded to the appeal board---appeal_board%1:14:00:: , that is the appropriate place---place%1:26:02:: for a registrant---registrant%1:18:00:: to lodge his denial---denial%1:10:01:: .
We found in Gonzales v. United States , supra , that this was the controlling reason---reason%1:16:00:: why copies---copy%1:10:00:: of the recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: should be furnished a registrant---registrant%1:18:00:: .
We said there that it was necessary `` that a registrant---registrant%1:18:00:: be given an opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to rebut [ the Department---group%1:03:00:: 's ] recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: when it comes to the Appeal Board , the agency---agency%1:14:00:: with the ultimate responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: for classification---classification%1:04:00:: '' .
We fail to see how such procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: resulted in any prejudice---prejudice%1:09:01:: to petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: 's contention---contention%1:10:02:: , which was considered by the appeal---appeal%1:04:00:: board---board%1:14:00:: and denied by it .
As was said in Gonzales , `` it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service---selective_service%1:14:00:: determination---determination%1:09:00:: considered ' final ' in the courts---court%1:14:00:: , not to be overturned unless there is no basis---basis%1:09:00:: in fact---fact%1:26:01:: .
But there are other contentions---contention%1:10:02:: which might be considered more difficult .
At his trial , petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum---subpoena_duces_tecum%1:10:00:: the longhand notes---note%1:10:00:: of the Department---group%1:03:00:: 's hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: , Evensen---person%1:03:00:: , as well as his report---report%1:10:03:: thereon .
Petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: also claimed at trial the right---right%1:07:00:: to inspect the original Federal Bureau of Investigation---group%1:03:00:: reports---report%1:10:03:: to the Department of Justice---group%1:03:00:: .
He alleged no specific procedural errors---error%1:04:02:: or evidence---evidence%1:10:00:: withheld ; nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence---evidence%1:10:00:: the Federal Bureau of Investigation---group%1:03:00:: reports---report%1:10:03:: might disclose .
Section---section%1:10:00:: 6 ( j ) of the Act , as we have held , does require the Department---group%1:03:00:: 's recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: to be placed in a registrant---registrant%1:18:00:: 's file .
But there is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: in the Act requiring the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: 's report---report%1:10:03:: to be likewise turned over to the registrant---registrant%1:18:00:: .
While the regulations---regulation%1:10:00:: formerly required that the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: 's report---report%1:10:03:: be placed in the registrant---registrant%1:18:00:: 's file , this requirement---requirement%1:09:01:: was eliminated in 1952 .
Moreover , the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: 's report---report%1:10:03:: is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney General---person%1:03:00:: and , of course , is not the recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: of the Department---group%1:03:00:: .
It is not essentially different from a memorandum---memorandum%1:10:00:: of an attorney---attorney%1:18:00:: in the Department of Justice---group%1:03:00:: , of which the Attorney General---person%1:03:00:: receives many , and to which he may give his approval---approval%1:04:02:: or rejection---rejection%1:04:00:: .
It is but part---part%1:24:00:: of the whole process---process%1:04:00:: within the Department---group%1:03:00:: that goes into the making---making%1:04:00:: of the final recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: to the appeal---appeal%1:04:00:: board---board%1:14:00:: .
It is also significant that neither this report---report%1:10:03:: nor the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: 's notes---note%1:10:00:: were furnished to the appeal---appeal%1:04:00:: board---board%1:14:00:: .
Hence the petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: had full opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to traverse the only conclusions---conclusion%1:09:00:: of the Department---group%1:03:00:: on file---file%1:10:00:: with the Board---group%1:03:00:: .
Petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: knew that the Department---group%1:03:00:: 's recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: was based not on the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: 's report---report%1:10:03:: but on the statement---statement%1:10:00:: of the local board---board%1:14:00:: in his file---file%1:10:00:: .
Having had every opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to rebut the finding---finding%1:04:01:: of the local board---board%1:14:00:: before both the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: and the appeal---appeal%1:04:00:: board---board%1:14:00:: , petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: cannot now claim that he was denied due process---due_process%1:04:00:: because he did not succeed .
It appears to us that the same reasoning---reasoning%1:09:00:: applies to the production---production%1:04:01:: of the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: 's report---report%1:10:03:: and notes---note%1:10:00:: at the trial .
In addition , petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: has failed to show any particular need---need%1:17:00:: for the report---report%1:10:03:: and notes---note%1:10:00:: .
While there are now allegations---allegation%1:10:01:: of the withholding---withholding%1:04:01:: of `` favorable evidence---evidence%1:10:00:: developed at the hearing---hearing%1:04:01:: '' and a denial---denial%1:10:00:: of a `` full and fair hearing---hearing%1:04:01:: '' , no such claim---claim%1:10:02:: was made by petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: at any stage---stage%1:26:00:: of the administrative process---process%1:04:00:: .
Moreover , his testimony---testimony%1:10:00:: at trial never developed any such facts---fact%1:09:01:: .
In the light---light%1:09:01:: of these circumstances---circumstance%1:09:00:: , as well as the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that the issue---issue%1:09:01:: at trial in this respect---respect%1:09:00:: centered entirely on the Department---group%1:03:00:: 's recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: , which petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: repudiated but which both the appeal---appeal%1:04:00:: board---board%1:14:00:: and the courts---court%1:14:00:: below found supported by the record---record%1:10:03:: , we find no relevancy---relevancy%1:24:00:: in the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: 's report---report%1:10:03:: and notes---note%1:10:00:: .
Finally petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI---group%1:03:00:: report---report%1:10:03:: during the proceedings---proceedings%1:04:00:: before the hearing officer---hearing_officer%1:18:00:: as well as at the trial .
He did receive a resume---resume%1:10:00:: of it - the same that was furnished the appeal---appeal%1:04:00:: board---board%1:14:00:: - and he made no claim---claim%1:10:02:: of its inaccuracy---inaccuracy%1:07:02:: .
Even now no such claim---claim%1:10:02:: is asserted .
He bases his present contention---contention%1:10:02:: on the general right---right%1:07:00:: to explore , indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy---discrepancy%1:07:00:: in the resume---resume%1:10:00:: .
There we held `` that the statutory scheme---scheme%1:09:00:: for review---review%1:09:00:: , within the selective service system---selective_service_system%1:14:00:: , entitles [ conscientious objectors---conscientious_objector%1:18:00:: ] to no guarantee---guarantee%1:10:01:: that the FBI---group%1:03:00:: reports---report%1:10:03:: must be produced for their inspection '' .
Even if we were not bound by Nugent , petitioner---petitioner%1:18:00:: here would not be entitled to the report---report%1:10:03:: .
The recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: of the Department---group%1:03:00:: - as well as the decision---decision%1:09:00:: of the appeal---appeal%1:04:00:: board---board%1:14:00:: - was based entirely on the local board---board%1:14:00:: file---file%1:10:00:: , not on an FBI---group%1:03:00:: report---report%1:10:03:: .
In general , religious interest---interest%1:09:00:: seems to exist in all parts---part%1:15:00:: of the metropolis---metropolis%1:15:00:: ; congregational membership---membership%1:14:00:: , however , is another thing---thing%1:09:02:: .
A congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership---membership%1:14:00:: ; that is , when it can preserve economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: .
Religious faith---faith%1:09:00:: can be considered a necessary condition---condition%1:10:01:: of membership---membership%1:14:00:: in a congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: , since the decision---decision%1:04:00:: to join a worshiping group---group%1:03:00:: requires some motive force---force%1:07:01:: , but faith---faith%1:09:00:: is not a sufficient condition---condition%1:10:01:: for joining ; the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of other members---member%1:18:00:: of similar social and economic level---level%1:26:01:: is the sufficient condition---condition%1:10:01:: .
The breakdown---breakdown%1:04:02:: of social homogeneity---homogeneity%1:07:00:: in inner city---inner_city%1:15:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: and the spread---spread%1:11:00:: of inner city---inner_city%1:15:00:: blight---blight%1:26:00:: account for the decline---decline%1:22:02:: of central city---central_city%1:15:00:: churches---church%1:14:00:: .
Central cities---central_city%1:15:00:: reveal two adverse features---feature%1:09:00:: for the major denominations---denomination%1:14:00:: :
( 1 ) central cities---central_city%1:15:00:: tend to be areas---area%1:15:01:: of residence---residence%1:15:00:: for lower social classes---social_class%1:14:00:: ; ( 2 ) central cities---central_city%1:15:00:: tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition---composition%1:07:01:: .
The central city---central_city%1:15:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: , in other words , exhibit the two characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: which violate the life principle---life_principle%1:18:00:: of congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: of the major denominations---denomination%1:14:00:: : they have too few middle-class people---people%1:14:00:: ; they mix middle-class people---people%1:14:00:: with lower-class residents---resident%1:18:00:: .
Central city---central_city%1:15:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: have become progressively poorer locales---locale%1:15:00:: for the major denominations---denomination%1:14:00:: since the exodus---exodus%1:04:00:: of middle-class people---people%1:14:00:: from most central cities---central_city%1:15:00:: .
With few exceptions---exception%1:09:00:: , the major denominations---denomination%1:14:00:: are rapidly losing their hold---hold%1:07:00:: on the central city---central_city%1:15:00:: .
The key---key%1:09:00:: to Protestant development---development%1:22:02:: , therefore , is economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: of the nucleus---nucleus%1:14:00:: of the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: .
Members---member%1:18:00:: of higher and lower social status---social_status%1:26:00:: often cluster around this nucleus---nucleus%1:14:00:: , so that Protestant figures---figure%1:23:00:: on social class---social_class%1:14:00:: give the impression---impression%1:07:00:: of spread---spread%1:07:00:: over all social classes---social_class%1:14:00:: ; but this is deceptive , for the core---core%1:14:00:: of membership---membership%1:14:00:: is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum---stratum%1:15:00:: .
The congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core---core%1:14:00:: from the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: ; moreover , residential mobility---mobility%1:07:00:: is so high in metropolitan areas---area%1:15:01:: that churches---church%1:14:00:: have to recruit constantly in their core---core%1:14:00:: stratum---stratum%1:15:00:: in order to survive ; they can lose higher - and lower status---status%1:26:00:: members---member%1:18:00:: from the church---church%1:14:00:: without collapsing , but they need adequate recruits---recruit%1:18:00:: for the core---core%1:14:00:: stratum---stratum%1:15:00:: in order to preserve economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: .
The congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: is first and foremost an economic peer group---peer_group%1:14:00:: ; it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship---fellowship%1:14:00:: .
If it were primarily a believing fellowship---fellowship%1:14:00:: , it would recruit believers---believer%1:18:00:: from all social and economic ranks---rank%1:26:00:: , something which most congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: of the New Protestantism---protestantism%1:09:00:: ( with a few notable exceptions---exception%1:09:00:: ) have not been able to do .
They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers---peer%1:18:00:: .
The vulnerability---vulnerability%1:26:00:: of Protestant congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: to social differences---difference%1:07:00:: has often been attributed to the `` folksy spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: '' of Protestant religious life---life%1:26:01:: ; in fact , a contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: is often drawn in this regard---regard%1:09:00:: with the `` impersonal '' Roman Catholic---roman_catholic%1:18:00:: parish---parish%1:14:00:: .
We have seen that the folksy spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: is confined to economic peers---peer%1:18:00:: ; consequently , the vulnerability---vulnerability%1:26:00:: to social difference---difference%1:07:00:: should not be attributed to the stress---stress%1:26:02:: on personal community in Protestant congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: ; actually , there is little evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: of such personal community in Protestant congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: , as we shall see in another connection---connection%1:24:00:: .
The vulnerability---vulnerability%1:26:00:: of Protestantism---protestantism%1:09:00:: to social differences---difference%1:07:00:: stems from the peculiar role---role%1:07:00:: of the new religious style---style%1:07:00:: in middle-class life---life%1:26:01:: , where the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: is a vehicle---vehicle%1:10:00:: of social and economic group---group%1:03:00:: identity---identity%1:09:00:: and must conform , therefore , to the principle---principle%1:09:00:: of economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: .
This fact---fact%1:09:01:: is evident in the recruitment---recruitment%1:04:00:: of new members---member%1:18:00:: .
The rule---rule%1:09:00:: of economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: in congregational life---life%1:26:01:: can be seen in the missionary---missionary%1:18:00:: outreach---outreach%1:04:00:: of the major denominations---denomination%1:14:00:: .
There is much talk---talk%1:10:00:: in theological circles---circle%1:14:00:: about the `` Church---church%1:14:00:: as Mission---mission%1:14:01:: '' and the `` Church---church%1:14:00:: 's Mission---mission%1:04:00:: '' ; theologians---theologian%1:18:00:: have been stressing the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that the Church---church%1:14:00:: does not exist for its own sake---sake%1:07:00:: but as a testimony---testimony%1:10:02:: in the world---world%1:09:01:: for the healing---healing%1:22:00:: of the world---world%1:09:01:: .
A crucial question---question%1:10:01:: , therefore , is what evangelism and mission---mission%1:04:02:: actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism---protestantism%1:09:00:: .
If economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: really shapes congregational life---life%1:26:01:: , then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: .
The task---task%1:04:00:: of a congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: would be defined , according to economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: , as the work---work%1:04:00:: of co-opting individuals---individual%1:03:00:: and families---family%1:14:02:: of similar social and economic position---position%1:26:00:: to replenish the nuclear core---core%1:14:00:: of the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: .
( Co-optation---co-optation%1:04:00:: means to choose by joint action---action%1:04:02:: in order to fill a vacancy---vacancy%1:26:00:: ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers---center%1:15:01:: of power---power%1:07:00:: from an environment---environment%1:26:00:: in order to strengthen an organization---organization%1:14:00:: . )
In a mobile society---society%1:14:00:: , congregational health---health%1:26:00:: depends on a constant process of recruitment---recruitment%1:04:00:: ; this recruitment---recruitment%1:04:00:: , however , must follow the pattern---pattern%1:09:03:: of economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: or it will disrupt the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: ; therefore , the recruitment---recruitment%1:04:00:: or missionary---missionary%1:18:00:: outreach---outreach%1:04:00:: of the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: will be co-optation---co-optation%1:04:00:: rather than proclamation---proclamation%1:10:00:: - like elements---element%1:09:00:: will have to be assimilated .
Evangelism and congregational outreach---outreach%1:04:00:: have not been carefully studied in the churches---church%1:14:00:: ; one study---study%1:04:00:: in Pittsburgh---pittsburgh%1:15:00:: , however , has illuminated the situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
In a sample---sample%1:09:00:: of new members---member%1:18:00:: of Pittsburgh---pittsburgh%1:15:00:: churches---church%1:14:00:: , almost 60 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: were recruited by initial `` contacts---contact%1:04:02:: with friendly members---member%1:18:00:: '' .
If we add to these contacts---contact%1:04:02:: with friendly members---member%1:18:00:: the `` contacts---contact%1:04:02:: with an organization---organization%1:14:00:: of the church---church%1:14:00:: '' ( 11.2 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the cases---case%1:11:00:: ) , then a substantial two thirds---third%1:23:00:: of all recruitment---recruitment%1:04:00:: is through friendly contact---contact%1:04:02:: .
On the surface---surface%1:09:00:: , this seems a sound approach---approach%1:04:02:: to Christian mission---mission%1:04:02:: : members---member%1:18:00:: of the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: show by their friendly attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: that they care for new people---people%1:14:00:: ; the new people---people%1:14:00:: respond in kind by joining the church---church%1:14:00:: .
Missionary---missionary%1:18:00:: outreach---outreach%1:04:00:: by friendly contact---contact%1:04:02:: looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact---contact%1:04:02:: in metropolitan neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:14:00:: ; the majority---majority%1:07:00:: of such contacts---contact%1:04:02:: are with people---people%1:14:00:: of similar social and economic position---position%1:26:00:: ; association---association%1:04:00:: by level---level%1:26:01:: of achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: is the dominant principle---principle%1:09:03:: of informal relations---relations%1:24:00:: .
This means that the antennae---antenna%1:07:00:: of the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: are extended into the community---community%1:14:00:: , picking up the wave lengths---wavelength%1:09:00:: of those who will fit into the social and economic level---level%1:26:01:: of the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: ; the mission---mission%1:04:00:: of the church---church%1:14:00:: is actually a process---process%1:04:00:: of informal co-optation---co-optation%1:04:00:: ; the lay ministry---ministry%1:14:01:: is a means---means%1:04:00:: to recruit like-minded people---people%1:14:00:: who will strengthen the social class---social_class%1:14:00:: nucleus---nucleus%1:14:00:: of the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: .
Churches---church%1:14:00:: can be strengthened through this process---process%1:04:00:: of co-optation---co-optation%1:04:00:: so long as the environs---environs%1:15:00:: of the church---church%1:14:00:: provide a sufficient pool---pool%1:14:01:: of people---people%1:14:00:: who can fit the pattern---pattern%1:09:03:: of economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: ; once the pool---pool%1:14:01:: of recruits---recruit%1:18:00:: diminishes , the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: is helpless - friendly contacts---contact%1:04:02:: no longer keep it going .
The transmutation---transmutation%1:04:00:: of mission---mission%1:04:02:: to co-optation---co-optation%1:04:00:: is further indicated by the insignificance---insignificance%1:07:00:: of educational activities---educational_activity%1:04:00:: , worship---worship%1:04:00:: , preaching---preaching%1:10:00:: , and publicity---publicity%1:10:00:: in reaching new members---member%1:18:00:: .
The proclamation---proclamation%1:10:00:: of the churches---church%1:14:00:: is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts---contact%1:04:02:: by the clergy---clergy%1:14:00:: ( 17.3 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of new members---member%1:18:00:: ) and friendly contacts---contact%1:04:02:: by members---member%1:18:00:: ( over two thirds---third%1:23:00:: if organizational activities---activity%1:26:00:: are included ) .
Publicity---publicity%1:10:00:: accounted for 1.1 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the initial contacts---contact%1:04:02:: with new members---member%1:18:00:: .
In general , friendly contact---contact%1:04:02:: with a member---member%1:18:00:: followed by contact---contact%1:04:02:: with a clergyman---clergyman%1:18:00:: will account for a major share---share%1:21:00:: of recruitment---recruitment%1:04:00:: by the churches---church%1:14:00:: , making it quite evident that the extension---extension%1:04:02:: of economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: through co-optation---co-optation%1:04:00:: is the principal form---form%1:09:01:: of mission---mission%1:04:02:: in the contemporary church---church%1:14:00:: ; economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: and co-optation---co-optation%1:04:00:: are the two methods by which Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: associate with and recruit from the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:14:00:: .
The inner life---life%1:26:01:: of congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: will prosper so long as like-minded people---people%1:14:00:: of similar social and economic level---level%1:26:01:: can fraternize together ; the outer life---life%1:26:01:: of congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: - the suitability---suitability%1:07:00:: of the environment---environment%1:26:00:: to their survival---survival%1:26:00:: - will be propitious so long as the people---people%1:14:00:: in the area---area%1:15:01:: are of the same social and economic level---level%1:26:01:: as the membership---membership%1:14:00:: .
Economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: ceases when the social and economic statuses---status%1:26:00:: in an area---area%1:15:01:: become too mixed or conflict with the status---status%1:26:00:: of the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: .
In a rapidly changing society---society%1:14:00:: congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: will run into difficulties---difficulty%1:26:00:: repeatedly , since such nice balances---balance%1:07:00:: of economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: are hard to sustain in the metropolis---metropolis%1:15:00:: for more than a single generation---generation%1:14:00:: .
The fact---fact%1:09:01:: that metropolitan churches---church%1:14:00:: of the major denominations---denomination%1:14:00:: have moved approximately every generation---generation%1:28:00:: for the last hundred years---year%1:28:01:: becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light---light%1:09:01:: of this struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: to maintain economic balance---balance%1:26:00:: .
The expense---expense%1:21:00:: of this type---type%1:09:00:: of organization---organization%1:09:00:: in religious life---life%1:26:01:: , when one recalls the number---number%1:23:00:: of city---city%1:15:00:: churches---church%1:06:00:: which deteriorated beyond repair---repair%1:04:00:: before being abandoned , raises fundamental questions---question%1:10:01:: about the principle---principle%1:09:00:: of Protestant survival---survival%1:26:00:: in a mobile society---society%1:14:00:: ; nonetheless , the prevalence---prevalence%1:07:00:: of economic integration---integration%1:04:00:: in congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: illumines the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of the Protestant development---development%1:22:02:: .
It was observed in the introductory chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: that metropolitan life---life%1:26:01:: had split into two trends---trend%1:15:02:: - expanding interdependence---interdependence%1:24:00:: on an impersonal basis---basis%1:24:00:: and growing exclusiveness---exclusiveness%1:07:00:: in local communal groupings---grouping%1:03:00:: .
These trends---trend%1:15:02:: seem to be working at cross-purposes---cross-purpose%1:09:00:: in the metropolis---metropolis%1:15:00:: .
Residential associations---association%1:14:00:: struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions---intrusion%1:11:00:: .
The motifs---motif%1:09:00:: of impersonal interdependence---interdependence%1:24:00:: and insulation---insulation%1:26:00:: of residential communities---community%1:14:00:: have polarized ; the schism---schism%1:04:00:: between central city---central_city%1:15:00:: and suburb---suburb%1:15:00:: , Negro---negro%1:18:00:: and White---white%1:18:00:: , blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization---polarization%1:26:00:: of trends---trend%1:15:02:: in the metropolis---metropolis%1:15:00:: .
It now becomes evident that the denominational church---church%1:14:00:: is intimately involved with the economy---economy%1:14:00:: of middle-class culture---culture%1:09:00:: , for it serves to crystallize the social class---social_class%1:14:00:: identity---identity%1:07:00:: of middle-class residential groupings---grouping%1:03:00:: .
The accelerated pace---pace%1:07:01:: of metropolitan changes---change%1:11:00:: has accentuated the drive---drive%1:04:04:: to conformity---conformity%1:07:02:: in congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: of the major denominations---denomination%1:14:00:: .
This conformity---conformity%1:07:02:: represents a desperate attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment---environment%1:26:00:: .
More than creatures---creature%1:18:02:: of metropolitan forces---force%1:07:01:: , the churches---church%1:14:00:: have taken the lead---lead%1:04:01:: in counteracting the interdependence---interdependence%1:24:00:: of metropolitan life---life%1:26:01:: , crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification---stratification%1:04:00:: of peoples---people%1:14:00:: , giving form---form%1:09:00:: to the struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: for social homogeneity---homogeneity%1:07:00:: in a world---world%1:17:01:: of heterogeneous peoples---people%1:14:00:: .
Since American life---life%1:26:01:: is committed above all to productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: and a higher standard---standard%1:10:00:: of economic life---life%1:26:01:: , the countervailing forces---force%1:07:01:: of residential and religious exclusiveness---exclusiveness%1:07:00:: have fought a desperate , rearguard---rearguard%1:14:00:: action---action%1:04:02:: against the expanding interdependence---interdependence%1:24:00:: of the metropolis---metropolis%1:15:00:: .
Consumer---consumer%1:18:00:: communities---community%1:14:00:: have suffered at the hands of the productive interests---interest%1:14:00:: .
Negroes---negro%1:18:00:: , Puerto Ricans---puerto_rican%1:18:00:: , and rural newcomers---newcomer%1:18:00:: are slowly making their way into the cities---city%1:15:00:: .
Soon they will fight their way---way%1:15:00:: into the lower middle-class suburbs---suburb%1:15:00:: , and the churches---church%1:14:00:: will experience the same decay---decay%1:22:01:: and rebuilding---rebuilding%1:04:00:: cycle---cycle%1:11:02:: which has characterized their history---history%1:28:00:: for a century---century%1:28:00:: .
The identification---identification%1:04:00:: of the basic unit---unit%1:17:00:: of religious organization---organization%1:09:00:: - the parish---parish%1:14:00:: or congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: - with a residential area---area%1:15:01:: is self defeating in a modern metropolis---metropolis%1:15:00:: , for it simply means the closing---closing%1:04:01:: of an iron trap---iron_trap%1:09:00:: on the outreach---outreach%1:04:00:: of the Christian fellowship---fellowship%1:14:00:: and the transmutation---transmutation%1:04:00:: of mission---mission%1:04:02:: to co-optation---co-optation%1:04:00:: .
Mission---mission%1:04:02:: to the metropolis---metropolis%1:15:00:: contradicts survival---survival%1:26:00:: of the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: in the residential community---community%1:14:00:: , because the middle classes---middle_class%1:14:00:: are fighting metropolitan interdependence---interdependence%1:24:00:: with residential exclusion---exclusion%1:26:00:: .
This interpretation---interpretation%1:09:01:: of the role---role%1:04:00:: of residence---residence%1:15:00:: in the economy---economy%1:14:00:: of middle-class culture---culture%1:09:00:: could lead to various projections---projection%1:09:01:: for the churches---church%1:14:00:: .
It could be argued that any fellowship---fellowship%1:14:00:: which centers in residential neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:14:00:: is doomed to become an expression---expression%1:10:02:: of the panic---panic%1:26:01:: for stable identity---identity%1:07:00:: among the middle classes---middle_class%1:14:00:: .
It could be argued that only such neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:14:00:: can sustain religious activity---activity%1:26:00:: , since worship---worship%1:04:00:: presupposes some local stabilities---stability%1:07:00:: .
Whatever projection---projection%1:09:01:: one makes , the striking fact---fact%1:09:01:: about congregational and parochial life---life%1:26:01:: is the extent---extent%1:26:00:: to which it is a vehicle---vehicle%1:10:00:: of the social identity---identity%1:07:00:: of middle-class people---people%1:14:00:: .
Attention---attention%1:09:00:: will be given in the next chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: to the style---style%1:07:00:: of association---association%1:04:00:: in the denominational churches---church%1:14:00:: ; this style---style%1:07:00:: is characteristically an expression---expression%1:10:02:: of the communal style---style%1:07:00:: of the middle classes---middle_class%1:14:00:: .
The keynotes---keynote%1:09:00:: of this style---style%1:07:00:: are activism---activism%1:09:00:: and emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: on achievements---achievement%1:04:00:: in gaining self-esteem---self-esteem%1:12:00:: .
These values---values%1:09:00:: give direction---direction%1:10:00:: to the life---life%1:09:00:: of the middle-class man---man%1:18:00:: or woman---woman%1:18:00:: , dictating the methods---method%1:09:00:: of child---child%1:18:00:: rearing---rearing%1:04:00:: , determining the pattern---pattern%1:09:03:: of community---community%1:14:00:: participation---participation%1:04:00:: , setting the style---style%1:09:00:: for the psychiatric treatment---treatment%1:04:00:: of middle-class illness---illness%1:26:00:: , and informing the congregational life---life%1:26:01:: of the major denominations---denomination%1:14:00:: .
`` Fellowship---fellowship%1:14:00:: by likeness---likeness%1:07:00:: '' and `` mission---mission%1:04:02:: by friendly contact---contact%1:04:02:: '' form the iron cage---iron_cage%1:26:00:: of denominational religion---religion%1:09:00:: .
Its contents---content%1:14:00:: are another matter---matter%1:09:01:: , for they reveal the kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of interests---interest%1:09:00:: pursued by the congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: .
What goes on in the cage---cage%1:26:00:: will occupy our attention---attention%1:09:00:: under the rubric---rubric%1:10:02:: of the organization---organization%1:04:00:: church---church%1:14:00:: .
An understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of the new role---role%1:04:00:: of residential association---association%1:04:00:: in an industrial society---society%1:14:00:: serves to illuminate the forces---force%1:07:01:: which have fashioned the iron cage---iron_cage%1:26:00:: of conformity---conformity%1:09:00:: which imprisons the churches---church%1:14:00:: in their suburban captivity---captivity%1:26:01:: .
The perplexing question---question%1:10:01:: still remains as to why the middle classes---middle_class%1:14:00:: turn to the churches---church%1:14:00:: as a vehicle---vehicle%1:10:00:: of social identity---identity%1:07:00:: when their clubs---club%1:14:00:: and charities---charity%1:14:00:: should fill the same need---need%1:17:00:: .
While no larger than Dutch Springs---location%1:03:00:: , this mining---mining%1:04:00:: supply---supply%1:22:00:: town---town%1:15:00:: had the appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: of being far busier and more prosperous .
Men---man%1:18:00:: crowded the streets---street%1:06:00:: and freight---freight%1:06:00:: rigs---rig%1:06:00:: and teams---team%1:14:01:: were moving about .
Although they were forced to maintain a sharper watch---watch%1:04:00:: , this activity---activity%1:04:00:: enabled them to ride in and rack their broncs---bronc%1:05:00:: without any particular attention---attention%1:09:00:: being paid them .
`` Gyp---person%1:03:00:: 'll be holdin ' forth in some bar---bar%1:06:04:: if he 's here at all '' , Cobb---person%1:03:00:: declared , glancing along the street---street%1:06:00:: as they stretched their legs---leg%1:08:01:: .
There were no less than six or seven saloons---saloon%1:06:01:: in Ganado---location%1:03:00:: , not counting the lower class---lower_class%1:14:00:: dives---dive%1:06:01:: , all vying for the trade---trade%1:04:01:: of celebrating miners---miner%1:18:00:: and teamsters---teamster%1:18:02:: .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: only nodded .
`` Take one side---side%1:15:02:: of the street---street%1:06:00:: , and I 'll take the other '' , he proposed .
`` If you spot Carmer---person%1:03:00:: give a yell---yell%1:10:00:: before you move in '' .
Cobb---person%1:03:00:: 's assent---assent%1:10:00:: was tight .
It 's all I ask , Stevens---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Separating , they took different sides---side%1:15:02:: of the main drag---main_drag%1:06:00:: and systematically combed the bars---bar%1:06:04:: .
Russ---person%1:03:00:: visited two places---place%1:15:04:: without result---result%1:11:00:: and his blood pressure---blood_pressure%1:19:00:: was down to zero .
Suddenly it seemed to him insane that they might hope to locate Gyp Carmer---person%1:03:00:: so casually , even were he to prove the thief---thief%1:18:00:: .
He tramped out of the Miners Rest---location%1:03:00:: with his hopes---hope%1:09:00:: plummeting , and headed doggedly for the Palace Saloon---location%1:03:00:: , the last place---place%1:15:04:: of any consequence---consequence%1:07:00:: on this side---side%1:15:02:: of the street---street%1:06:00:: .
The Palace---location%1:03:00:: was an elaborate establishment---establishment%1:06:00:: , built practically on stilts---stilt%1:06:01:: in front , with long flights---flight%1:06:00:: of wooden steps---steps%1:06:00:: running up to the porch---porch%1:06:00:: .
Behind its ornate facade---facade%1:06:00:: the notorious dive---dive%1:06:01:: clung like a bird---bird%1:05:00:: 's nest---nest%1:17:00:: to the rocky ribs---rib%1:06:00:: of the canyonside---canyonside%1:17:00:: .
Russ---person%1:03:00:: ran up the steps---steps%1:06:00:: quickly to the plank---plank%1:27:00:: porch---porch%1:06:00:: .
The front---front%1:15:00:: windows---window%1:06:00:: of the place---place%1:15:04:: were long and narrow , reaching nearly to the floor---floor%1:06:00:: and affording an unusually good view---view%1:04:00:: of the interior---interior%1:15:01:: .
Heading for the batwings---batwing%1:06:00:: , Cobb---person%1:03:00:: glanced perfunctorily through the nearest window---window%1:06:00:: , and suddenly dodged aside .
Nerves---nerve%1:08:00:: tight as a bowstring---bowstring%1:06:00:: , he paused to gather his wits---wit%1:09:00:: .
Against all expectation---expectation%1:09:00:: , Carmer---person%1:03:00:: was inside , clearly enjoying himself to the hilt and already so tipsy that it seemed unlikely he was bothering to note anything or anyone about him .
Fierce anger---anger%1:12:00:: surged through Russ---person%1:03:00:: .
He fought down the impulse---impulse%1:12:01:: to rush in and collar the vicious puncher---puncher%1:18:00:: on the spot .
Reaching the porch---porch%1:06:00:: rail---rail%1:06:02:: beyond view---view%1:04:00:: of the bar---bar%1:06:04:: windows---window%1:06:00:: , he feverishly scanned the busy street---street%1:06:00:: below .
Stevens---person%1:03:00:: was nowhere in sight .
Muffling an exclamation---exclamation%1:10:00:: , Russ---person%1:03:00:: sprang to the nearest steps---steps%1:06:00:: and ran down .
As luck---luck%1:19:00:: had it , he had not gone twenty feet---foot%1:23:00:: in the street---street%1:06:00:: before Pat---person%1:03:00:: appeared .
`` What luck---luck%1:26:00:: , Cobb---person%1:03:00:: '' ? he said swiftly .
Russ---person%1:03:00:: pointed upward .
`` He 's there '' , he got out tersely , curbing his rising excitement---excitement%1:26:01:: .
Hitching his cartridge belt---cartridge_belt%1:06:00:: around , Pat---person%1:03:00:: glanced upward briefly at the Palace---location%1:03:00:: and started that way---way%1:15:00:: with Cobb---person%1:03:00:: at his side---side%1:15:02:: .
Climbing the steps---steps%1:06:00:: steadily , they reached the top---top%1:15:02:: and headed for the door---door%1:06:01:: .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: pushed through first .
Forced behind him momentarily , Russ---person%1:03:00:: followed at once and halted two steps---step%1:23:00:: inside .
His eyes---eye%1:08:00:: widened .
While five minutes---minute%1:28:00:: ago the place---place%1:15:04:: had presented a scene---scene%1:11:00:: of easy revelry---revelry%1:04:00:: , with Gyp Carmer---person%1:03:00:: a prominent figure---figure%1:18:00:: , it was now as somnolent and dull as the day---day%1:28:00:: before payday---payday%1:28:00:: .
Carmer---person%1:03:00:: himself was nowhere to be seen .
A man---man%1:18:00:: knocked the roulette ball---roulette_ball%1:06:00:: about idly in its track---track%1:17:00:: , and another dozed at one of the card tables---card_table%1:06:01:: .
Two men---man%1:18:00:: murmured with their heads---head%1:08:00:: together at the end---end%1:15:00:: of the bar---bar%1:06:05:: , while the sleek headed bartender---bartender%1:18:00:: absently polished a glass---glass%1:06:00:: .
Looking the setup---setup%1:07:00:: over , Stevens---person%1:03:00:: started coolly for the rear---rear%1:15:01:: of the place---place%1:15:04:: .
It was the barkeep---barkeep%1:18:00:: .
Halting , Pat---person%1:03:00:: turned to survey him deliberately .
He did not reply , going on toward the back---back%1:15:02:: .
Less assured than the tall , wide shouldered man---man%1:18:00:: in the lead , Cobb---person%1:03:00:: followed alertly , a hand---hand%1:08:00:: on his gun---gun%1:06:00:: butt---butt%1:06:00:: .
The bartender---bartender%1:18:00:: measured this situation---situation%1:26:00:: with heavy eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and decided he wanted no part---part%1:09:02:: of it .
A hall---hall%1:06:03:: opened in back of the bar---bar%1:06:05:: , running toward an ell---ell%1:06:00:: .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: moved into it .
Small rooms---room%1:06:00:: , probably for cards---cards%1:04:00:: , opened off on either side---side%1:15:02:: .
All the doors---door%1:06:00:: were open at this hour---hour%1:28:01:: except one , and it was toward this that Stevens---person%1:03:00:: made his way---way%1:15:00:: with Russ---person%1:03:00:: close at his shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
The door---door%1:06:00:: was locked .
A single kick---kick%1:04:00:: made it spring open , shuddering .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: saw Gyp Carmer---person%1:03:00:: staggering forward , a half filled bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: upraised as if to strike .
Russ---person%1:03:00:: sprang through to bat it nimbly aside .
With a bellow---bellow%1:10:00:: Carmer---person%1:03:00:: lunged at him .
But he was more than half drunk , and his faculties---faculty%1:09:00:: were dulled .
Cobb---person%1:03:00:: unleashed a single powerful jab---jab%1:04:00:: that sent Gyp---person%1:03:00:: reeling wildly and crashing down with a whining groan---groan%1:10:00:: .
Russ---person%1:03:00:: gave him a brutal thrust---thrust%1:04:01:: that tumbled him over flat on his stomach---stomach%1:08:01:: .
Kneeling , Cobb---person%1:03:00:: planted a sturdy knee---knee%1:08:00:: in the small---small%1:08:00:: of his back---back%1:08:00:: , holding him pinned .
`` Okay , Stevens---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Go through his pockets---pocket%1:06:00:: , will you ?
Complying methodically , Pat---person%1:03:00:: pulled pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: after pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: inside out without finding a thing---thing%1:06:01:: .
Cobb---person%1:03:00:: watched this with hunted eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , his desperate hope---hope%1:12:01:: waning by the moment---moment%1:28:01:: .
Stevens---person%1:03:00:: was grunting over the last empty pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: when Russ---person%1:03:00:: abruptly rose and lunged toward Carmer---person%1:03:00:: 's hat---hat%1:06:00:: , which had tumbled half-a-dozen---half_a_dozen%1:23:00:: feet---foot%1:23:00:: away when he first fell .
Cobb---person%1:03:00:: got it .
Straightening up , his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: ablaze , he held out the battered Stetson---stetson%1:06:00:: .
Inside the crown---crown%1:06:00:: , stuffed behind the stained sweatband---sweatband%1:06:01:: , could be seen thin , crumpled wads---wads%1:23:00:: of currency---currency%1:21:00:: .
Carmer---person%1:03:00:: 's ingenious cache---cache%1:06:00:: for his loot---loot%1:21:00:: had been found .
`` By golly , Stevens---person%1:03:00:: !
You were right '' , Russ---person%1:03:00:: exclaimed , tearing the loose bills---bill%1:21:00:: out of Carmer---person%1:03:00:: 's hat---hat%1:06:00:: .
`` That is , if we can be sure this is Colcord---person%1:03:00:: 's money---money%1:21:00:: '' -
Pat---person%1:03:00:: grunted .
Count what you 've got there , Cobb---person%1:03:00:: .
Russ---person%1:03:00:: ran through the bills---bill%1:21:00:: and named an amount---amount%1:21:00:: it was highly unlikely any cowpuncher---cowpuncher%1:18:00:: would come by honestly .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: nodded .
`` It 's within a hundred of what Crip---person%1:03:00:: had '' , he declared .
`` We know Penny---person%1:03:00:: spent some - and Carmer---person%1:03:00:: must have dropped a few dollars---dollar%1:21:00:: getting that load---load%1:23:01:: on '' .
Handing the money---money%1:21:00:: over , Russ---person%1:03:00:: wiped his hands---hand%1:08:00:: on his pants-legs---pant_leg%1:06:00:: as if ridding himself of something unclean .
His glance---glance%1:04:00:: at Gyp Carmer---person%1:03:00:: was disdainful .
Leaving the card room---cardroom%1:06:00:: , they moved back through the Palace---location%1:03:00:: the way---way%1:15:00:: they had come .
Glowering looks---look%1:07:01:: met them in the bar---bar%1:06:04:: , but there was no attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to halt them .
Pausing in the outside door---outside_door%1:06:00:: to glance behind him , Pat---person%1:03:00:: looked his unspoken warning---warning%1:10:01:: and stepped out .
He and Cobb---person%1:03:00:: clattered down the high steps---steps%1:06:00:: to the street---street%1:06:00:: .
Neither spoke till they reached their horses---horse%1:05:00:: .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: paused there , looking across at the young fellow---fellow%1:18:00:: .
It 'll be a pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: for you to return this money---money%1:21:00:: to Colcord---person%1:03:00:: and tell him about it , Russ---person%1:03:00:: `` .
To his faint surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: Russ---person%1:03:00:: held up his hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
It was you that tracked it down anyway , Stevens---person%1:03:00:: `` , he pursued strictly .
'' I 'll shove along home---home%1:15:04:: `` .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: swung into the saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: , yet still he delayed , his brows---brow%1:08:01:: puckered .
`` You owe it to Penny---person%1:03:00:: to give her a chance---chance%1:26:00:: to explain that she was defending you , really '' , he observed mildly .
`` Old Crip---person%1:03:00:: was n't '' , retorted Cobb---person%1:03:00:: tartly .
Then maybe next time---time%1:11:00:: he won n't be so quick on the trigger---trigger%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Pat---person%1:03:00:: had never pretended to give advice---advice%1:10:00:: in such affairs---affairs%1:09:00:: .
'' You 're the doctor `` , he returned with a smile---smile%1:10:00:: .
'' But I still think Penny---person%1:03:00:: 's an awful nice girl---girl%1:18:00:: , Russ---person%1:03:00:: `` -
`` You do n't have to tell me '' , flashed Cobb---person%1:03:00:: .
Giving the other a dark look---look%1:07:01:: , he hauled his bronc---bronc%1:05:00:: around and trotted down off the street---street%1:06:00:: .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: let him go , following more leisurely .
At the first restaurant---restaurant%1:06:00:: he sensibly pulled up to go in for his dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: , and as a consequence---consequence%1:19:00:: did not see Cobb---person%1:03:00:: strike the open range---range%1:15:02:: at the mouth---mouth%1:17:01:: of the canyon---canyon%1:17:00:: and head straight across the swells---swell%1:17:00:: for Antler---location%1:03:00:: .
The truth---truth%1:26:00:: was , the puncher---puncher%1:18:00:: was both bewildered and dismayed by his own mixed luck---luck%1:26:00:: .
`` Penny---person%1:03:00:: 's always glad to see me over there '' , he mused bleakly .
Yet had he not visited the girl---girl%1:18:00:: at Saw Buck---location%1:03:00:: he would never have been involved in this latest tangle---tangle%1:09:00:: .
Over and above that , however , was his growing suspicion---suspicion%1:09:01:: of Chuck Stober---person%1:03:00:: 's part---part%1:04:01:: in recent events---event%1:26:00:: .
`` Gyp Carmer---person%1:03:00:: could n't have known about Colcord---person%1:03:00:: 's money---money%1:21:00:: unless he was told - and who else would have told him '' ? he asked himself .
`` It 's the second time---time%1:11:00:: War Ax hands---hands%1:14:00:: made a play---play%1:04:03:: for that money---money%1:21:00:: .
How much of an accident---accident%1:11:00:: could that be `` ?
Nearing home---home%1:15:04:: , he jerked to attention---attention%1:09:01:: at the distant crack of a gun---gun%1:06:00:: .
In town no one paid much attention---attention%1:09:02:: to an occasional shot ; but on the range gunfire had a meaning .
In town---town%1:15:00:: no one paid much attention---attention%1:09:00:: to an occasional shot---shot%1:04:00:: ; but on the range---range%1:15:02:: gunfire---gunfire%1:04:00:: had a meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: .
Hauling up , Russ---person%1:03:00:: listened carefully .
Two minutes---minute%1:28:00:: later it came again - a double explosion---explosion%1:11:00:: , followed by a third , sounding more distant .
As near as Cobb---person%1:03:00:: could determine the shots---shot%1:04:00:: came from the direction---direction%1:15:00:: of the Antler---location%1:03:00:: ranch house---ranch_house%1:06:00:: .
He tightened up in a twinkling---twinkling%1:28:00:: .
So far as he knew , only his father---father%1:18:00:: could be there .
Clapping spurs---spur%1:06:00:: to the bronc---bronc%1:05:00:: he set off at a sharp canter---canter%1:04:00:: , with growing alarm---alarm%1:12:00:: .
His first glimpse---glimpse%1:04:00:: of the ranch house---ranch_house%1:06:00:: across the brushy swells---swell%1:17:00:: told him nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
Still a quarter-mile---quarter_mile%1:23:00:: away , the fresh clap---clap%1:11:00:: of guns---gun%1:06:00:: only served to increase his speed---speed%1:04:00:: .
Setting a course---course%1:17:00:: straight for the house---house%1:06:00:: , he was covering ground---ground%1:17:00:: fast when an angry bee---bee%1:05:00:: buzzed past close to his face---face%1:08:00:: .
When it was followed by a second , whining even closer , Cobb---person%1:03:00:: swerved sharply aside into a depression---depression%1:17:00:: .
Whoever was out there hiding in the brushy cover---cover%1:06:02:: was besieging the Antler---location%1:03:00:: house---house%1:06:00:: and , having spotted his approach---approach%1:04:00:: , was determined to drive him off before he could get into the fight---fight%1:04:02:: .
Cursing himself for having ridden out the last few days---day%1:28:00:: without a rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: in his saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: boot---boot%1:06:01:: , Russ---person%1:03:00:: drew his Colt---colt%1:06:00:: and examined it briefly .
If he wondered whether the attackers---attacker%1:18:00:: would allow him to pull away unmolested , he had his answer---answer%1:10:01:: a moment---moment%1:28:00:: later .
`` Over this way---way%1:15:00:: !
He ai n't gone far '' ! a harsh cry---cry%1:10:00:: floated to him across the brush---brush%1:14:00:: .
A carbine---carbine%1:06:00:: cracked more loudly , and a slug---slug%1:06:00:: clipped fragments---fragment%1:17:01:: from the brush---brush%1:14:00:: off at one side---side%1:15:02:: .
The would-be assassin---assassin%1:18:00:: had his position---position%1:15:00:: figured pretty close .
Dismounting , Russ---person%1:03:00:: looked about hastily .
Toward the west this depression---depression%1:17:00:: led toward a draw---draw%1:17:00:: .
Leading his pony---pony%1:05:02:: , he hurried that way---way%1:15:00:: , not remounting till he was well below the level---level%1:07:01:: of the surrounding range---range%1:15:02:: .
Swinging up then , and bending forward over the horn---horn%1:06:04:: , he urged his mount---mount%1:05:00:: down the meandering draw---draw%1:17:00:: .
He had not covered a hundred yards---yard%1:23:00:: before a gun---gun%1:06:00:: crashed from somewhere behind .
He had been sighted , and his attacker---attacker%1:18:00:: pumping shot---shot%1:06:00:: after shot---shot%1:06:00:: .
A shot---shot%1:06:00:: or two went wild before Cobb---person%1:03:00:: felt something tug at his foot---foot%1:08:01:: .
A slug---slug%1:06:00:: had torn half---half%1:23:00:: of his stirrup---stirrup%1:06:00:: guard---guard%1:06:00:: away .
A second twitched his shirtsleeve---shirtsleeve%1:06:00:: , and he felt a brief burn---burn%1:26:00:: on his upper arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
At the first shot---shot%1:04:00:: Russ---person%1:03:00:: had hurled his mount---mount%1:05:00:: to the left toward the side---side%1:15:02:: of the winding draw---draw%1:17:00:: .
The long minute---minute%1:28:02:: before he reached effective cover---cover%1:04:00:: seemed endless .
Sweeping a look---look%1:04:00:: around , he saw that he was safe for the moment .
He heard cries---cry%1:10:00:: from behind him , but he could make out no words---words%1:10:03:: .
He dashed madly for the next elbow---elbow%1:06:01:: turn---turn%1:25:00:: in the draw---draw%1:17:00:: , and made it .
Recklessly hurling the bronc---bronc%1:05:00:: sidewise into an intersecting draw---draw%1:17:00:: , he plunged forward with undiminished speed---speed%1:04:00:: .
Gradually the wash---wash%1:17:00:: climbed upward , forcing him toward open range---range%1:15:02:: .
He clambered out of the dwindling wash---wash%1:17:00:: , the loose dirt---dirt%1:27:01:: flying behind him , and flashed a look---look%1:04:00:: about .
It will be shown that the objectives---objective%1:09:00:: of the cooperative people---people%1:14:00:: in an organization---organization%1:14:00:: determine the type---type%1:09:00:: of network---network%1:14:00:: required , because the type---type%1:09:00:: of network---network%1:14:00:: functions according to the characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: of the messages---message%1:10:00:: enumerated in Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 .
Great stress---stress%1:26:03:: is placed on the role---role%1:04:00:: that the monitoring---monitoring%1:04:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness---effectiveness%1:07:00:: of the network---network%1:14:00:: .
By monitoring---monitoring%1:04:00:: , we mean some system---system%1:06:00:: of control---control%1:24:00:: over the types---type%1:09:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: sent from the various centers---center%1:15:02:: .
As a word---word%1:10:03:: of caution---caution%1:10:00:: , we should be aware that in actual practice---practice%1:04:04:: no message---message%1:10:00:: is purely one---one%1:23:00:: of the four types---type%1:09:00:: , question---question%1:10:03:: , command---command%1:10:00:: , statement---statement%1:10:00:: , or exclamation---exclamation%1:10:00:: .
For example , suppose a man---man%1:18:00:: wearing a $ 200 watch---watch%1:06:00:: , driving a 1959 Rolls Royce , stops to ask a man---man%1:18:00:: on the sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: , `` What time---time%1:28:03:: is it '' ?
This sentence---sentence%1:10:00:: would have most of the characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: of a question---question%1:10:03:: , but it has some of the characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: of a statement---statement%1:10:00:: because the questioner---questioner%1:18:00:: has conveyed the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that he has no faith---faith%1:09:01:: in his own timepiece---timepiece%1:06:00:: or the one attached to his car---car%1:06:00:: .
If the man---man%1:18:00:: on the sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: is surprised at this question---question%1:10:03:: , it has served as an exclamation---exclamation%1:10:00:: .
Also , since the man---man%1:18:00:: questioned feels a strong compulsion---compulsion%1:16:01:: to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: of being thought queer ) the question---question%1:10:03:: has assumed some measurable properties---property%1:07:00:: of a command---command%1:10:00:: .
However , for convenience---convenience%1:26:00:: we will stick to the idea---idea%1:09:00:: that information---information%1:10:00:: can be classified according to Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 .
On this basis---basis%1:09:00:: , certain extreme kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of networks---network%1:14:00:: will be discussed for illustrative purposes---purpose%1:07:00:: .
Presumably a cocktail party---cocktail_party%1:11:00:: is expected to fulfill the host---host%1:18:02:: 's desire---desire%1:07:00:: to get together a number---number%1:07:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level---level%1:07:00:: of acquaintance---acquaintance%1:26:00:: up to adequacy---adequacy%1:07:00:: for future cooperative endeavors---endeavor%1:04:01:: .
The party---party%1:14:00:: is usually in a room---room%1:06:00:: small enough so that all guests---guest%1:18:00:: are within sight---sight%1:09:02:: and hearing---hearing%1:15:00:: of one---one%1:23:00:: another .
The information---information%1:10:00:: is furnished by each of the guests---guest%1:18:00:: , is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves---air_wave%1:11:00:: , and is received by the ears---ear%1:08:00:: .
Since the air---air%1:27:00:: is a continuum---continuum%1:28:00:: , the network---network%1:14:00:: of communication---communication%1:10:01:: remains intact regardless of the positions---position%1:07:00:: or motions---motion%1:11:00:: of the points---point%1:15:00:: ( the people---people%1:14:00:: ) in the net---net%1:06:01:: .
As shown in Figure 1 , there is a connection---connection%1:26:00:: for communication between every pair of points .
As shown in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 1 , there is a connection---connection%1:06:00:: for communication---communication%1:10:01:: between every pair---pair%1:23:00:: of points---point%1:15:00:: .
This , and other qualifications---qualification%1:04:00:: , make the cocktail party---cocktail_party%1:11:00:: the most complete and most chaotic communication system---communication_system%1:06:01:: ever dreamed up .
All four types---type%1:09:00:: of message---message%1:10:00:: listed in Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 are permitted , although decorum---decorum%1:07:00:: and cocktail---cocktail_party%1:11:00:: tradition---tradition%1:09:02:: require holding the commands---command%1:10:00:: to a minimum---minimum%1:23:00:: , while exclamations---exclamation%1:10:00:: having complimentary intonations---intonation%1:10:00:: are more than customarily encouraged .
The completeness---completeness%1:26:00:: of the connections---connection%1:06:00:: provide that , for N people---people%1:14:00:: , there are * * f lines---line%1:15:00:: of communication---communication%1:24:00:: between the pairs---pair%1:23:00:: , which can become a large number---large_number%1:23:00:: ( 1225 ) for a party---party%1:14:00:: of fifty guests---guest%1:18:00:: .
The completeness of the connections---connection%1:26:00:: provide that , for N people , there are * * f lines of communication between the pairs , which can become a large number ( 1225 ) for a party of fifty guests .
Looking at the diagram , we see that * * f connection---connection%1:26:00:: lines come in to each member .
Looking at the diagram---diagram%1:06:00:: , we see that * * f connection---connection%1:06:00:: lines---line%1:15:00:: come in to each member---member%1:18:00:: .
Thus the cocktail party---cocktail_party%1:11:00:: would appear to be the ideal system---system%1:06:00:: , but there is one weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: .
In spite of the dreams---dream%1:12:00:: of the host for oneness in the group , the * * f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond comprehension if N exceeds about six .
In spite of the dreams---dream%1:09:02:: of the host---host%1:18:02:: for oneness---oneness%1:07:00:: in the group---group%1:03:00:: , the * * f incoming messages---message%1:10:00:: for each guest---guest%1:18:00:: overload his receiving system---receiving_system%1:06:00:: beyond comprehension---comprehension%1:09:00:: if N exceeds about six .
The crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: consequently breaks up into temporary groups---group%1:03:00:: ranging in size---size%1:07:00:: from two---two%1:23:00:: to six---six%1:23:00:: , with a half-life---half_life%1:28:00:: for the cluster---cluster%1:14:00:: ranging from three to twenty minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
For the occasion---occasion%1:11:01:: on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host---host%1:18:02:: wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers---newcomer%1:18:01:: , then the `` open house---open_house%1:14:00:: '' system---system%1:06:00:: is advantageous because the honored guests---guest%1:18:00:: are fixed connective points---point%1:15:00:: and the drifting guests---guest%1:18:00:: make and break connections---connection%1:24:00:: at the door---door%1:06:01:: .
We consider a rural community as an assemblage---assemblage%1:14:00:: of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence .
We consider a rural community---community%1:14:00:: as an assemblage---assemblage%1:04:00:: of inhabited dwellings---dwelling%1:06:00:: whose configuration---configuration%1:09:00:: is determined by the location---location%1:03:00:: and size---size%1:07:00:: of the arable land sites---land_site%1:15:00:: necessary for family---family%1:14:02:: subsistence---subsistence%1:26:01:: .
We assume for this illustration---illustration%1:10:01:: that the size---size%1:07:00:: of the land---land%1:21:01:: plots---plot%1:15:00:: is so great that the distance---distance%1:07:00:: between dwellings---dwelling%1:06:00:: is greater than the voice---voice%1:07:00:: can carry and that most of the communication---communication%1:10:01:: is between nearest neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: only , as shown in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 .
Information---information%1:10:00:: beyond nearest neighbor---neighbor%1:18:00:: is carried second - , third - , and fourth hand---hand%1:15:00:: as a distortable rumor---rumor%1:10:00:: .
In Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 , the points---point%1:15:00:: in the network---network%1:14:00:: are designated by a letter---letter%1:10:01:: accompanied by a number---number%1:10:01:: .
The numbers---number%1:10:01:: indicate the number---number%1:07:00:: of nearest neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: .
It will be noted that point---point%1:09:00:: f has seven nearest neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: , h and e have six , and p has only one , while the remaining points---point%1:09:00:: have intermediate numbers---number%1:23:00:: .
In any social system---social_system%1:14:00:: in which communications---communication%1:10:01:: have an importance---importance%1:07:00:: comparable with that of production---production%1:04:00:: and other human factors---factor%1:11:00:: , a point---point%1:09:00:: like f in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 would ( other things---thing%1:09:00:: being equal ) be the dwelling---dwelling%1:06:00:: place---place%1:09:00:: for the community---community%1:14:00:: leader---leader%1:18:00:: , while e and h would house the next most important citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: .
A point---point%1:09:00:: like p gets information---information%1:10:00:: directly from n , but all information---information%1:10:00:: beyond n is indirectly relayed through n .
The dweller---dweller%1:18:00:: at p is last to hear about a new cure---cure%1:06:00:: , the slowest to announce to his neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: his urgent distresses---distress%1:26:01:: , the one who goes the farthest to trade , and the one with the greatest difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: of all in putting over an idea---idea%1:09:01:: or getting people---people%1:14:00:: to join him in a cooperative effort---effort%1:04:00:: .
Since the hazards---hazard%1:19:00:: of poor communication---communication%1:10:01:: are so great , p can be justified as a habitable site---site%1:15:00:: only on the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of unusual productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: such as is made available by a waterfall---waterfall%1:17:00:: for milling purposes---purpose%1:07:00:: , a mine---mine%1:06:01:: , or a sugar maple---sugar_maple%1:20:00:: camp---camp%1:14:00:: .
Location---location%1:03:00:: theorists---theorist%1:18:00:: have given these matters---matter%1:09:00:: much consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: .
Location theorists have given these matters---matter%1:09:01:: much consideration .
The networks---network%1:14:00:: for military communications---communication%1:10:01:: are one---one%1:23:00:: of the best examples---example%1:09:00:: of networks---network%1:14:00:: which not only must be changed with the changes---change%1:19:00:: in objectives---objective%1:09:00:: but also must be changed with the addition---addition%1:04:02:: of new machines---machine%1:06:00:: of war---war%1:04:00:: .
They also furnish proof---proof%1:09:00:: that , in modern war---war%1:04:00:: , message---message%1:10:01:: sending---sending%1:04:00:: must be monitored .
Without monitoring , a military hookup---hookup%1:06:01:: becomes a noisy party---party%1:14:02:: .
The need---need%1:26:00:: for monitoring became greater when radio---radio%1:10:00:: was adopted for military signaling---signaling%1:10:00:: .
Alexander the Great---alexander_the_great%1:18:00:: , who used runners---runner%1:18:03:: as message---message%1:10:01:: carriers---carrier%1:18:03:: , did not have to worry about having every officer---officer%1:18:03:: in his command---command%1:14:00:: hear what he said and having hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of them comment at once .
As time---time%1:03:00:: has passed and science has progressed , the speed---speed%1:28:00:: of military vehicles---military_vehicle%1:06:00:: has increased , the range---range%1:15:01:: of missiles---missile%1:06:01:: has been extended , the use---use%1:04:00:: of target-hunting noses---nose%1:06:00:: on the projectiles---projectile%1:06:00:: has been adopted , and the range---range%1:15:01:: and breadth---breadth%1:09:00:: of message---message%1:10:01:: sending has increased .
As time has passed and science has progressed , the speed of military vehicles has increased , the range---range%1:07:00:: of missiles has been extended , the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted , and the range---range%1:07:00:: and breadth of message sending has increased .
Next to the old problem---problem%1:26:00:: of the slowness---slowness%1:09:02:: of decision making---decision_making%1:09:00:: , network---network%1:14:00:: structure---structure%1:06:00:: seems to be paramount , and without monitoring no network---network%1:14:00:: has value---value%1:07:00:: .
On the parade ground---parade_ground%1:15:00:: the net---net%1:06:01:: may be similar to that shown in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 .
The monitoring---monitoring%1:04:00:: is the highest and most restrictive of any organization---organization%1:14:01:: in existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
No questions---question%1:10:00:: , statements---statement%1:10:00:: , or explanations---explanation%1:10:00:: are permitted - only commands---command%1:10:00:: .
Commands---command%1:10:00:: go only from an officer---officer%1:18:03:: to the man---man%1:18:03:: of nearest lower rank---lower_rank%1:26:00:: .
The same command---command%1:10:00:: is repeated as many times---time%1:11:00:: as there are levels---level%1:26:01:: in rank---rank%1:26:00:: from general---general%1:18:00:: to corporal---corporal%1:18:00:: .
All orders---order%1:10:03:: originate with the officer---officer%1:18:03:: of highest rank---rank%1:26:00:: and terminate with action---action%1:04:03:: of the men---man%1:18:03:: in the ranks---rank%1:14:01:: .
Even the officer---officer%1:18:03:: in charge , be it a captain---captain%1:18:05:: ( for small display---display%1:10:01:: ) or a general---general%1:18:00:: , is restrained by monitoring .
This is done for simplicity---simplicity%1:07:02:: of commands---command%1:10:00:: and to bring the hidden redundancy---redundancy%1:10:00:: up to where misunderstanding---misunderstanding%1:10:00:: has almost zero possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: .
The commands---command%1:10:00:: are specified by the military regulations---regulation%1:10:00:: ; are few in number---number%1:23:00:: , briefly worded , all different in sound---sound%1:07:00:: ; and are combinable into sequences---sequence%1:14:00:: which permit any marching---march%1:04:00:: maneuver---maneuver%1:04:02:: that could be desired on a parade ground---parade_ground%1:15:00:: .
This monitoring---monitoring%1:04:00:: is necessary because , on a parade ground---parade_ground%1:15:00:: , everyone can hear too much , and without monitoring a confused social event---social_event%1:11:00:: would develop .
With troops---troops%1:14:00:: dispersed on fields of battle---field_of_battle%1:15:00:: rather than on the parade ground---parade_ground%1:15:00:: , it may seem that a certain amount---amount%1:03:00:: of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines---line%1:14:02:: of communication---communication%1:10:01:: .
Years---years%1:28:01:: ago this was true , but with the replacement---replacement%1:04:00:: of wires---wire%1:10:00:: or runners---runner%1:18:04:: by radio---radio%1:06:00:: and radar---radar%1:06:00:: ( and perhaps television---television%1:06:00:: ) , these restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard .
In contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: to cocktail parties---cocktail_party%1:11:00:: , military organizations---organization%1:14:00:: , even in the field---field%1:15:03:: , are more formal .
In the extreme and oversimplified example---example%1:09:00:: suggested in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 , the organization---organization%1:09:00:: is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: .
A military organization---organization%1:14:01:: has an objective---objective%1:09:00:: chosen by the higher command---command%1:14:00:: .
This objective---objective%1:09:00:: is adhered to throughout the duration---duration%1:28:02:: of the action---action%1:04:03:: .
The connective system---system%1:06:00:: , or network---network%1:14:00:: , is tailored to meet the requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: of the objective---objective%1:09:00:: , and it is therefore not surprising that a military body---body%1:14:00:: acting as a single coordinated unit---unit%1:14:00:: has a different communication---communication%1:10:01:: network---network%1:14:00:: than a factory---factory%1:06:00:: , a college---college%1:14:00:: , or a rural village---village%1:14:00:: .
The assumptions---assumption%1:10:00:: upon which the example---example%1:09:00:: shown in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 is based are : ( a ) One man---man%1:18:03:: can direct about six subordinates---subordinate%1:18:00:: if the subordinates---subordinate%1:18:00:: are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching , indoctrinating , etc. .
( b ) A message---message%1:10:01:: runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times---time%1:11:00:: .
( c ) Decisions---decision%1:04:00:: of a general kind---kind%1:09:00:: are made by the central command---command%1:14:00:: .
And ( d ) all action---action%1:04:03:: of a physical kind---kind%1:09:00:: pertinent to the mission---mission%1:04:00:: is relegated to the line---line%1:14:03:: of men---man%1:18:03:: on the lower rank---lower_rank%1:26:00:: .
And ( d ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission---mission%1:04:01:: is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank .
These assumptions---assumption%1:10:00:: lead to an organization---organization%1:14:00:: with one man---man%1:18:03:: at the top---top%1:15:01:: , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels---level%1:26:01:: of personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: .
These assumptions lead to an organization---organization%1:14:01:: with one man at the top , six directly under him , six under each of these , and so on until there are six levels of personnel .
The number---number%1:07:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: acting as one body---body%1:14:00:: by this scheme---scheme%1:09:00:: gives a surprisingly large army---army%1:14:00:: of * * f 55987 men---man%1:18:03:: .
This organizational network---network%1:14:00:: would be of no avail---avail%1:07:00:: if there were no regulations---regulation%1:09:00:: pertaining to the types---type%1:09:00:: of message---message%1:10:01:: sent .
Of types---type%1:09:00:: of message---message%1:10:01:: listed in Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 , commands---command%1:10:00:: and statements---statement%1:10:00:: are the only ones sent through the vertical network---network%1:14:00:: shown in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 .
A further regulation---regulation%1:09:00:: is that commands---command%1:10:00:: always go down , unaccompanied by statements---statement%1:10:00:: , and statements---statement%1:10:00:: always go up , unaccompanied by commands---command%1:10:00:: .
Questions---question%1:10:03:: and , particularly , exclamations---exclamation%1:10:00:: are usually channeled along informal , horizontal lines---line%1:14:02:: not indicated in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor---neighbor%1:18:00:: .
It will readily be seen that in this suggested network---network%1:14:00:: ( not materially different from some of the networks---network%1:14:00:: in vogue today---today%1:28:00:: ) greater emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice---practice%1:04:04:: .
Furthermore , the network---network%1:14:00:: in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 is only the basic net---net%1:06:01:: through which other networks---network%1:14:00:: pertaining to logistics---logistics%1:04:00:: and the like---the_like%1:09:00:: are interlaced .
Not discussed here are some military problems---problem%1:26:00:: of modern times---modern_times%1:28:00:: such as undersea warfare---warfare%1:04:00:: , where the surveillance---surveillance%1:04:01:: , sending---sending%1:04:00:: , transmitting---transmitting%1:04:00:: , and receiving are all so inadequate that networks---network%1:14:00:: and decision making---decision_making%1:09:00:: are not the bottlenecks---bottleneck%1:25:00:: .
Such problems---problem%1:26:00:: are of extreme interest---interest%1:09:00:: as well as importance---importance%1:07:00:: and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare---warfare%1:04:00:: at night---night%1:28:00:: in tall grass---grass%1:20:00:: that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts---conflict%1:04:00:: for what they could teach .
This is an unsolved problem---problem%1:26:00:: which probably has never been seriously investigated , although one frequently hears the comment---comment%1:10:00:: that we have insufficient specialists---specialist%1:18:00:: of the kind---kind%1:09:00:: who can compete with the Germans---german%1:18:00:: or Swiss---swiss%1:18:00:: , for example , in precision---precision%1:07:00:: machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: and mathematics---mathematics%1:09:00:: , or the Finns---finn%1:18:00:: in geochemistry---geochemistry%1:09:00:: .
We hear equally fervent concern---concern%1:12:01:: over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes .
We hear equally fervent concern---concern%1:09:01:: over the belief---belief%1:09:00:: that we have not enough generalists---generalist%1:18:00:: who can see the over-all picture---picture%1:26:00:: and combine our national skills---skill%1:09:01:: and knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: for useful purposes---purpose%1:07:00:: .
This problem---problem%1:26:00:: of the optimum balance---balance%1:26:00:: in the relative numbers---number%1:07:00:: of generalists---generalist%1:18:00:: and specialists---specialist%1:18:00:: can be investigated on a communicative network---network%1:14:00:: basis---basis%1:09:00:: .
Since the difficulty---difficulty%1:07:00:: of drawing the net---net%1:06:01:: is great , we will merely discuss it .
First , we realize that a pure specialist---specialist%1:18:00:: does not exist .
But , for practical purposes---purpose%1:07:00:: , we have people---people%1:14:00:: who can be considered as such .
For example , there are persons---person%1:03:00:: who are in physical science---physical_science%1:09:00:: , in the field---field%1:09:00:: of mineralogy---mineralogy%1:09:00:: , trained in crystallography---crystallography%1:09:00:: , who use only X-rays---x_ray%1:19:00:: , applying only the powder technique---powder_technique%1:22:00:: of X-ray diffraction---x-ray_diffraction%1:19:00:: , to clay---clay%1:27:00:: minerals---mineral%1:27:00:: only , and who have spent the last fifteen years---year%1:28:01:: concentrating on the montmorillonites ; or persons---person%1:03:00:: in the social sciences---social_science%1:09:00:: in the field---field%1:09:00:: of anthropology---anthropology%1:09:00:: , studying the lung---lung%1:08:00:: capacity---capacity%1:23:00:: of seven Andean Indians---indian%1:18:00:: .
So we see that a specialist---specialist%1:18:00:: is a man---man%1:18:00:: who knows more and more about less and less as he develops , as contrasted to the generalist---generalist%1:18:00:: , who knows less and less about more and more .
During the last years---year%1:28:01:: of Woodrow Wilson---person%1:03:00:: 's administration---administration%1:28:00:: , a red scare---red_scare%1:26:00:: developed in our country---country%1:14:00:: .
Many Americans---american%1:18:00:: reacted irrationally to the challenge---challenge%1:26:00:: of Russia---russia%1:15:00:: and turned to the repression---repression%1:26:00:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: by force---force%1:04:01:: .
Postmaster General---postmaster_general%1:18:00:: Burleson---person%1:03:00:: set about to protect the American people---people%1:14:01:: against radical propaganda---propaganda%1:10:00:: that might be spread through the mails---mail%1:10:00:: .
Attorney General---attorney_general%1:04:00:: Palmer---person%1:03:00:: made a series---series%1:14:00:: of raids---raid%1:04:00:: that sent more than 4000 so-called radicals---radical%1:18:01:: to the jails---jail%1:06:00:: , in direct violation---violation%1:04:01:: of their constitutional rights---right%1:07:00:: .
Then , not many years---year%1:28:01:: later , the Un-American Activities Committee---group%1:03:00:: , under the leadership---leadership%1:04:00:: of Martin Dies---person%1:03:00:: , pilloried hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of decent , patriotic citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: .
Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects---defect%1:07:01:: in our form---form%1:09:01:: of democracy---democracy%1:14:00:: was denounced as a traitorous red---red%1:18:00:: whose real purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: was the destruction---destruction%1:11:00:: of our government---government%1:14:00:: .
This hysteria---hysteria%1:12:01:: reached its height---height%1:26:00:: under the leadership---leadership%1:04:00:: of Senator Joseph McCarthy---person%1:03:00:: .
Demagogues---demagogue%1:18:00:: of this sort---sort%1:09:00:: found communist bogeys---bogey%1:18:00:: lurking behind any new idea---idea%1:09:00:: that would run counter to stereotyped notions---notion%1:09:02:: .
New ideas---idea%1:09:00:: were dangerous and must be repressed , no matter how .
Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: , credit ideas---idea%1:09:00:: with high potency---potency%1:07:01:: .
They give strict interpretation---interpretation%1:09:01:: to William James---william_james%1:18:00:: ' statement---statement%1:10:00:: that `` Every idea---idea%1:09:00:: that enters the mind---mind%1:09:00:: tends to express itself '' .
They seem to believe that a person---person%1:03:00:: will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new .
Hence , the only defensible procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: is to repress any and every notion---notion%1:09:02:: , unless it gives evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that it is perfectly safe .
Despite this danger---danger%1:04:00:: , however , we are informed on every hand---hand%1:15:00:: that ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , not machines---machine%1:06:00:: , are our finest tools---tool%1:04:00:: ; they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger---ledger%1:06:00:: page---page%1:10:00:: ; they are the most valuable of commodities---commodity%1:06:00:: - and the most salable , for their demand---demand%1:22:00:: far exceeds supply---supply%1:22:00:: .
So all-important are ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , we are told , that persons---person%1:03:00:: successful in business---business%1:04:01:: and happy in social life---life%1:26:01:: usually fall into two classes---class%1:14:00:: : those who invent new ideas---idea%1:09:00:: of their own , and those who borrow , beg , or steal from others .
Seemingly , with an unrestricted flow---flow%1:22:00:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , all will be well , and we are even assured that `` an idea---idea%1:09:00:: a day---day%1:28:00:: will keep the sheriff---sheriff%1:18:00:: away '' .
That , however , may also bring the police---police%1:14:00:: , if the thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: does not meet with social approval---approval%1:12:00:: .
Criminals---criminal%1:18:00:: , as well as model citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: , exercise their minds---mind%1:09:00:: .
Merely having a mental image---mental_image%1:09:00:: of some sort---sort%1:09:00:: is not the all-important consideration---consideration%1:09:01:: .
Of course , there must be clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: : a single distinct impression---impression%1:09:00:: is more valuable than many fuzzy ones .
But clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: is not enough---enough%1:23:00:: .
The writer---writer%1:18:01:: took a class---class%1:14:03:: of college students---college_student%1:18:00:: to the state hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: for the mentally ill in St. Joseph---location%1:03:00:: , Missouri---missouri%1:15:00:: .
An inmate---inmate%1:18:01:: , a former university---university%1:14:00:: professor---professor%1:18:00:: , expounded to us , logically and clearly , that someone was pilfering his thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: .
He appealed to us to bring his case---case%1:26:00:: to the attention---attention%1:09:00:: of the authorities---authority%1:18:01:: that justice might be done .
Despite the clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: of his presentation---presentation%1:04:01:: , his idea---idea%1:09:00:: was not of Einsteinian calibre---calibre%1:07:00:: .
True , ideas---idea%1:09:00:: are important , perhaps life---life%1:09:00:: 's most precious treasures---treasure%1:06:00:: .
But have we not gone overboard in stressing their significance---significance%1:07:00:: ?
Have we not actually developed idea---idea%1:09:00:: worship---worship%1:04:00:: ?
Ideas---idea%1:09:00:: we must have , and we seek them everywhere .
We scour literature---literature%1:10:00:: for them ; here we find stored the wisdom---wisdom%1:09:02:: of great minds---mind%1:18:00:: .
But are all these works---work%1:06:00:: worthy of consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: ?
Can they stand rigid scrutiny---scrutiny%1:04:00:: ?
Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: 's wit---wit%1:10:00:: and wisdom---wisdom%1:09:01:: , his profound insight---insight%1:09:02:: into human nature---nature%1:07:02:: , have stood the test---test%1:04:03:: of centuries---century%1:28:00:: .
But was he infallible in all things---thing%1:09:02:: ?
What of his treatment---treatment%1:07:00:: of the Jew---jew%1:18:00:: in The Merchant of Venice ?
Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: gives us a vivid picture---picture%1:09:00:: of Shylock---person%1:03:00:: , but probably he never saw a Jew---jew%1:18:00:: , unless in some of his travels---travel%1:04:00:: .
The Jews---jew%1:18:00:: had been banished from England---england%1:15:00:: in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655 , when Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: had been dead for thirty-nine years---year%1:28:01:: .
If any had escaped expulsion---expulsion%1:04:01:: by hiding , they certainly would not frequent the market-place---marketplace%1:06:00:: .
Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: did not usually invent the incidents---incident%1:11:00:: in his plays---play%1:10:01:: , but borrowed them from old stories---story%1:10:00:: , ballads---ballad%1:10:00:: , and plays---play%1:10:01:: , wove them together , and then breathed into them his spark---spark%1:07:00:: of life---life%1:07:01:: .
Rather than from a first-hand study---study%1:04:00:: of Jewish people---people%1:14:00:: , his delineation---delineation%1:10:01:: of Shylock---person%1:03:00:: stems from a collection---collection%1:10:00:: of Italian stories---story%1:10:00:: , Il Pecorone , published in 1558 , although written almost two centuries---century%1:28:00:: earlier .
He could learn at second hand---second_hand%1:18:00:: from books---book%1:10:00:: , but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: .
Harris J. Griston---person%1:03:00:: , in Shaking The Dust From Shakespeare ( 216 ) , writes : `` There is not a word---word%1:10:00:: spoken by Shylock---person%1:03:00:: which one would expect from a real Jew---jew%1:18:00:: '' .
He took the story---story%1:10:00:: of the pound---pound%1:23:09:: of flesh---flesh%1:08:01:: and had to fasten it on someone .
The Jew---jew%1:18:00:: was the safest victim---victim%1:18:00:: .
No Jew---jew%1:18:00:: was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater---theater%1:06:00:: .
It would have been unwise policy---policy%1:09:00:: , for instance , to apply the pound---pound%1:23:09:: of flesh---flesh%1:08:01:: characterization---characterization%1:10:00:: to the thrifty Scotchman---scotchman%1:18:00:: .
Just as now anyone may hurl insults---insult%1:10:00:: at a citizen---citizen%1:18:00:: of Mars---mars%1:17:00:: , or even of Tikopia---location%1:03:00:: , and no senatorial investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: will result .
Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: does not tell us that Shylock---person%1:03:00:: was an aberrant individual---individual%1:03:00:: .
He sets him forth as being typical of the group---group%1:03:00:: .
He tells of his `` Jewish heart---heart%1:09:00:: '' - not a Shylockian heart---heart%1:09:00:: ; but a Jewish heart---heart%1:09:00:: .
This would make anyone crafty and cruel , capable of fiendish revenge---revenge%1:04:00:: .
There is no justification---justification%1:09:00:: for such misrepresentation---misrepresentation%1:10:00:: .
If living Jews---jew%1:18:00:: were unavailable for study---study%1:04:00:: , the Bible---bible%1:10:00:: was at hand .
Reading the Old Testament---old_testament%1:10:00:: would have shown the dramatist---dramatist%1:18:00:: that the ideas---idea%1:09:00:: attributed to Shylock---person%1:03:00:: were abhorrent to the Jews---jew%1:18:00:: .
Are we better off for having Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: 's idea---idea%1:09:00:: of Shylock---person%1:03:00:: ?
Studying The Merchant of Venice in high school---high_school%1:14:00:: and college---college%1:14:00:: has given many young people---people%1:14:00:: their notions---notion%1:09:02:: about Jews---jew%1:18:00:: .
Does this help the non-Jew---non-jew%1:18:00:: to understand this group---group%1:03:00:: ?
Thomas de Torquemada---person%1:03:00:: , Inquisitor-General of the Spanish Inquisition---group%1:03:00:: , put many persons---person%1:03:00:: to death .
His name---name%1:10:00:: became synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty---cruelty%1:04:00:: .
Would we gain by keeping alive his memory---memory%1:09:02:: and besmirching today---today%1:28:00:: 's Roman Catholics---roman_catholic%1:18:00:: by saying he had a Catholic heart---heart%1:09:00:: ?
Let his bones---bone%1:08:00:: and his memory---memory%1:09:02:: rest in the fifteenth century---century%1:28:00:: where they belong ; he is out of place in our times---times%1:28:01:: .
Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: 's Shylock---person%1:03:00:: , too , is of dubious value---value%1:07:00:: in the modern world---modern_world%1:28:00:: .
Ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , in and of themselves , are not necessarily the greatest good---good%1:07:02:: .
A successful businessman---businessman%1:18:00:: recently prefaced his address---address%1:10:00:: to a luncheon---luncheon%1:13:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: with the statement---statement%1:10:00:: that all economists---economist%1:18:00:: should be sent to the hospitals---hospital%1:06:00:: for the mentally deranged where they and their theories---theory%1:09:00:: might rot together .
Will his words---words%1:10:03:: come to be treasured and quoted through the years---year%1:28:01:: ?
Frequently we are given assurance---assurance%1:10:01:: that automatically all ideas---idea%1:09:00:: will be sifted and resifted and in the end only the good ones will survive .
But is that not like going to a chemistry laboratory---chemistry_laboratory%1:06:00:: and blindly pouring out liquids---liquid%1:27:00:: and powders---powder%1:27:00:: from an array---array%1:14:00:: of bottles---bottle%1:06:00:: and then , after stirring , expecting a new wonder drug inevitably to result ?
What of the efficiency---efficiency%1:24:00:: of this natural instrument---instrument%1:04:00:: of free discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: ?
Is there some magic---magic%1:09:00:: in it that assures results---result%1:19:00:: ?
When Peter B. Kyne---person%1:03:00:: ( Pride of Palomar , 43 ) informed us in 1921 that we had an instinctive dislike---dislike%1:12:00:: for the Japanese---japanese%1:18:00:: , did the heated debates---debate%1:10:01:: of the Californians---californian%1:18:00:: settle the truth---truth%1:26:00:: or falsity---falsity%1:26:00:: of the proposition---proposition%1:10:00:: ?
The Leopard 's Spots came from the pen---pen%1:06:00:: of Thomas Dixon---person%1:03:00:: in 1902 , and in this he announced an `` unchangeable '' law---law%1:09:00:: .
If a child---child%1:18:00:: had a single drop---drop%1:23:00:: of Negro---negro%1:18:00:: blood---blood%1:14:00:: , he would revert to the ancestral line---line%1:14:00:: which , except as slaves---slave%1:18:00:: under a superior race---race%1:14:00:: , had not made one step---step%1:23:00:: of progress---progress%1:04:01:: in 3000 years---year%1:28:01:: .
That doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: has been accepted by many , but has it produced good results---result%1:19:00:: ?
In the same vein---vein%1:10:00:: , a certain short-story---short_story%1:10:00:: plot---plot%1:10:00:: has been overworked .
The son---son%1:18:00:: and heir---heir%1:18:00:: of a prominent family---family%1:14:01:: marries a girl---girl%1:18:00:: who has tell-tale shadows---shadow%1:26:01:: on the half-moons---half-moon%1:08:00:: of her finger nails---fingernail%1:08:00:: .
In time she presents her aristocratic husband---husband%1:18:00:: with a coal-black child---child%1:18:01:: .
Is the world better for having this idea---idea%1:09:00:: thrust upon it ?
Will argument---argument%1:10:03:: and debate---debate%1:10:01:: decide its truth---truth%1:26:00:: or falsity---falsity%1:10:00:: ?
For answers---answer%1:10:02:: to such questions---question%1:10:00:: we must turn to the anthropologists---anthropologist%1:18:00:: , the biologists---biologist%1:18:00:: , the historians---historian%1:18:00:: , the psychologists---psychologist%1:18:00:: , and the sociologists---sociologist%1:18:00:: .
Long ago they consigned the notions---notion%1:09:02:: of Kyne---person%1:03:00:: and Dixon---person%1:03:00:: to the scrap heap---scrapheap%1:15:00:: .
False ideas---idea%1:09:00:: surfeit another sector---sector%1:09:00:: of our life---life%1:26:01:: .
For several generations---generation%1:28:00:: much fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: has appeared dealing with the steprelationship---steprelationship%1:24:00:: .
The stepmother---stepmother%1:18:00:: , almost without exception---exception%1:09:00:: , has been presented as a cruel ogress---ogress%1:18:00:: .
Children---child%1:18:00:: , conditioned by this mistaken notion---notion%1:09:02:: , have feared stepmothers---stepmother%1:18:00:: , while adults---adult%1:18:00:: , by their antagonistic attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: , have made the role---role%1:04:00:: of the substitute parents---parent%1:18:00:: a difficult one .
Debate---debate%1:10:01:: is not likely to resolve the tensions---tension%1:26:03:: and make the lot---lot%1:26:00:: of the stepchild---stepchild%1:18:00:: a happier one .
Research---research%1:04:00:: , on the other hand , has shown many stepmothers---stepmother%1:18:00:: to be eminently successful , some far better than the real mothers---mother%1:18:00:: .
Helen Deutsch---person%1:03:00:: informed us ( The Psychology of Women , Vol. 2 , , 434 ) that in all cultures---culture%1:14:00:: `` the term---term%1:10:00:: ' stepmother---stepmother%1:18:00:: ' automatically evokes deprecatory implications---implication%1:09:01:: '' , a conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: accepted by many .
Will mere debate---debate%1:10:01:: on that proposition---proposition%1:10:00:: , even though it be free and untrammeled , remove the dross---dross%1:27:01:: and leave a residue---residue%1:27:00:: of refined gold---gold%1:21:00:: ?
Research---research%1:04:00:: into several cultures---culture%1:14:00:: has proven her position---position%1:09:00:: to be a mistaken one .
Most assuredly ideas---idea%1:09:00:: are invaluable .
But ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , just for the sake---sake%1:07:00:: of having them , are not enough---enough%1:23:00:: .
In the 1930 's , cures---cure%1:06:00:: for the depression---depression%1:26:02:: literally flooded Washington---washington%1:15:01:: .
For a time---time%1:28:05:: the President---president%1:18:00:: received hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of them every day , most of them worthless .
Ideas---idea%1:09:00:: need to be tested , and not merely by argument---argument%1:10:03:: and debate---debate%1:10:01:: .
When some question---question%1:10:00:: arises in the medical field---field%1:09:00:: concerning cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: , for instance , we do not turn to free and open discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: as in a political campaign---political_campaign%1:11:00:: .
We have recourse---recourse%1:04:00:: to the scientifically trained specialist---specialist%1:18:00:: in the laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: .
The merits---merit%1:07:01:: of the Salk---person%1:03:00:: anti polio---polio%1:26:00:: vaccine---vaccine%1:06:00:: were not established on the forensic platform---platform%1:06:00:: or in newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: editorials---editorial%1:10:00:: , but in the laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: and by tests---test%1:09:02:: in the field---field%1:15:01:: on thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of children---child%1:18:00:: .
Our presidential campaigns---campaign%1:11:00:: provide much debate---debate%1:10:01:: and argument---argument%1:10:03:: .
But is the result---result%1:19:00:: new barnsful---barnful%1:23:00:: of tested knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: on the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of which we can with confidence solve our domestic and international problems---problem%1:26:00:: ?
Man , we are told , is endowed with reason---reason%1:09:00:: and is capable of distinguishing good---good%1:07:01:: from bad---bad%1:07:00:: .
But what a super Herculean task---task%1:04:01:: it is to winnow anything of value---value%1:07:00:: from the mud beplastered arguments---argument%1:10:02:: used so freely , particularly since such common use---use%1:07:02:: is made of cliches---cliche%1:10:00:: and stereotypes---stereotype%1:09:00:: , in themselves declarations---declaration%1:10:00:: of intellectual bankruptcy---bankruptcy%1:26:01:: .
We are reminded , however , that freedom of thought---freedom_of_thought%1:07:00:: and discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: , the unfettered exchange---exchange%1:04:03:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , is basic under our form of government---form_of_government%1:14:00:: .
Assuredly in our political campaigns---political_campaign%1:11:00:: there is freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: to think , to examine any and all issues---issue%1:09:01:: , and to speak without restraint---restraint%1:04:00:: .
But have the results---result%1:19:00:: been heartening ?
May we state with confidence that in such an exhibition---exhibition%1:04:00:: a republic---republic%1:14:00:: will find its greatest security---security%1:26:00:: ?
We must not forget , to be sure , that free discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: and debate---debate%1:10:01:: have produced beneficial results---result%1:19:00:: .
In truth , we can say that this broke the power---power%1:07:00:: of Senator Joseph McCarthy---person%1:03:00:: , who was finally exposed in full light---light%1:09:01:: to the American people---people%1:14:01:: .
If he had been `` liquidated '' in some way , he would have become a martyr---martyr%1:18:00:: , a rallying point---rallying_point%1:10:00:: for people---people%1:14:00:: who shared his ideas---idea%1:09:00:: .
Debate---debate%1:10:01:: in the political arena---political_arena%1:26:00:: can be productive of good---good%1:07:02:: .
But it is a clumsy and wasteful process---process%1:04:00:: : it can produce negative results---result%1:19:00:: but not much---much%1:23:00:: that is positive .
Debate---debate%1:10:01:: rid us of McCarthy---person%1:03:00:: but did not give us much---much%1:23:00:: that is positive .
It did something to clear the ground---ground%1:17:00:: , but it erected no striking new structure---structure%1:06:00:: ; it did not even provide the architect---architect%1:18:00:: 's plan---plan%1:06:00:: for anything new .
In the field---field%1:09:00:: of the natural sciences---natural_science%1:09:00:: , scientifically verified data---data%1:14:00:: are quite readily available and any discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: can be shortened with good results---result%1:19:00:: .
In the field---field%1:09:00:: of the social sciences---social_science%1:09:00:: a considerable fund---fund%1:21:01:: of tested knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: has been accumulated that can be used to good advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: .
By no means would we discourage the production---production%1:04:00:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: : they provide raw materials---raw_material%1:27:00:: with which to work ; they provide stimulations---stimulation%1:09:00:: that lead to further production---production%1:04:00:: .
We would establish no censorship---censorship%1:04:01:: .
My interviews---interview%1:10:01:: with teen-agers---teenager%1:18:00:: confirmed this portrait---portrait%1:10:00:: of the weakening---weakening%1:11:00:: of religious and ethnic bonds---bond%1:24:00:: .
Jewish identity---identity%1:09:00:: was often confused with social and economic strivings---striving%1:04:00:: .
`` Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive---drive%1:07:00:: '' , a boy---boy%1:18:00:: remarked .
When I pressed for a purely religious definition---definition%1:10:00:: , I encountered the familiar blend---blend%1:11:00:: of liberal piety---piety%1:07:00:: , interfaith good will---good_will%1:07:00:: , and a small residue---residue%1:24:00:: of ethnic loyalty---loyalty%1:12:00:: .
`` I like the tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: '' , a girl---girl%1:18:00:: said .
`` I like to follow the holidays---holiday%1:28:01:: when they come along .
But you do n't have to worship in the traditional way---way%1:07:01:: .
You can communicate in your own way---way%1:07:01:: .
As I see it , there 's no real difference---difference%1:07:00:: between being Jewish , Catholic , or Protestant '' .
Another teen-ager---teenager%1:18:00:: remarked : `` Most Jews---jew%1:18:00:: do n't believe in God---god%1:18:00:: , but they believe in people---people%1:14:00:: - in helping people---people%1:14:00:: '' .
Still another boy---boy%1:18:00:: asserted : `` To be a good Jew---jew%1:18:00:: is to do no wrong---wrong%1:07:01:: ; it 's to be a good person---good_person%1:18:00:: '' .
When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant---protestant%1:18:00:: , the boy---boy%1:18:00:: answered , `` It 's the same thing---thing%1:26:00:: '' .
This accords with the study---study%1:10:00:: by Maier---person%1:03:00:: and Spinrad---person%1:03:00:: .
They discovered that , although 42 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of a sample---sample%1:09:01:: of Catholic students---student%1:18:00:: and 15 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: believed it important to live in accordance---accordance%1:10:00:: with the teachings---teaching%1:09:00:: of their religion---religion%1:14:00:: , only 8 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the Jewish students---student%1:18:00:: had this conviction---conviction%1:09:00:: .
The most important aims---aim%1:09:00:: of the Jewish students---student%1:18:00:: were as follows : to make the world---world%1:17:00:: a better place---place%1:15:00:: to live in - 30 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: ; to get happiness---happiness%1:26:00:: for yourself - 28 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: ; and financial independence---independence%1:26:00:: - 21 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: .
Nevertheless , most of the teen-agers---teenager%1:18:00:: I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity---identity%1:07:00:: and even envisioned joining a synagogue---synagogue%1:06:00:: or temple---temple%1:06:00:: .
However , they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy---orthodoxy%1:07:00:: , professing to believe in Judaism---judaism%1:14:00:: `` but in a moderate way---way%1:07:01:: '' .
One boy---boy%1:18:00:: said querulously about Orthodox Jews---jew%1:18:00:: : `` It 's the twentieth century---century%1:28:00:: , and they do n't have to wear beards---beard%1:08:00:: '' .
The reason---reason%1:16:00:: offered for clinging to the ancestral faith---faith%1:14:00:: lacked force---force%1:07:01:: and authority---authority%1:09:00:: even in the teen-agers---teenager%1:18:00:: ' minds---mind%1:09:00:: .
`` We were brought up that way---way%1:04:00:: '' was one statement---statement%1:10:00:: which won general assent---assent%1:10:00:: .
`` I want to show respect---respect%1:04:02:: for my parents---parent%1:18:00:: ' religion---religion%1:14:00:: '' was the way---way%1:07:01:: in which a boy---boy%1:18:00:: justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism---judaism%1:14:00:: .
Still another suggested that he would join a temple---temple%1:06:00:: `` for social reasons---reason%1:16:00:: , since I 'll be living in a suburb---suburb%1:15:00:: '' .
Intermarriage---intermarriage%1:26:02:: , which is generally regarded as a threat---threat%1:26:00:: to Jewish survival---survival%1:26:00:: , was regarded not with horror---horror%1:12:01:: or apprehension---apprehension%1:12:00:: but with a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of mild , clinical disapproval---disapproval%1:12:00:: .
Most of the teen-agers---teenager%1:18:00:: I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds---ground%1:16:00:: .
`` When you marry , you want to have things---thing%1:07:00:: in common '' , a girl---girl%1:18:00:: said , `` and it 's hard when you do n't marry someone with your own background---background%1:07:00:: '' .
A fourteen year---year%1:28:01:: old girl---girl%1:18:00:: from the Middle West---middle_west%1:15:00:: observed wryly that , in her community---community%1:14:00:: , religion---religion%1:09:00:: inconveniently interfered with religious activities---activity%1:04:00:: - at least with the peripheral activities---activity%1:04:00:: that many middle class Jews---jew%1:18:00:: now regard as religious .
It appears that an Orthodox girl---girl%1:18:00:: in the community---community%1:14:00:: disrupted plans---plan%1:09:00:: for an outing---outing%1:04:00:: sponsored by one of the Jewish service---service%1:04:00:: groups---group%1:03:00:: because she would not travel on Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: and , in addition , required kosher food---food%1:03:00:: .
Another girl---girl%1:18:00:: from a relatively large midwestern city---city%1:15:00:: described herself as `` the only Orthodox girl---girl%1:18:00:: in town---town%1:15:00:: '' .
This is , no doubt , inaccurate , but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army---army%1:14:01:: of the nonobservant .
One of the significant things---thing%1:26:00:: about Jewish culture---culture%1:09:00:: in the older teen years---years%1:28:00:: is that it is largely college---college%1:14:00:: oriented .
Sixty five per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the Jewish teen-agers---teenager%1:18:00:: of college---college%1:14:00:: age---age%1:28:00:: attend institutions---institution%1:14:00:: of higher learning---learning%1:09:02:: .
This is substantially higher than the figures---figure%1:23:00:: for the American population---population%1:14:00:: at large - 45.6 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: for males---male%1:18:00:: and 29.2 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: for females---female%1:18:00:: .
This may help explain a phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: described by a small town---small_town%1:14:00:: Jewish boy---boy%1:18:00:: .
In their first two years---year%1:28:01:: in high school---high_school%1:14:00:: , Jewish boys---boy%1:18:00:: in this town---town%1:15:00:: make strenuous exertions---exertion%1:04:00:: to win positions---position%1:04:02:: on the school---school%1:14:00:: teams---team%1:14:00:: .
In their first two years---year%1:28:02:: in high school , Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams .
However , in their junior and senior years---year%1:28:02:: , they generally forego their athletic pursuits , presumably in the interest of better academic achievement .
However , in their junior and senior years---year%1:28:01:: , they generally forego their athletic pursuits---pursuit%1:04:00:: , presumably in the interest---interest%1:07:01:: of better academic achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: .
It is significant , too , that the older teen-agers---teenager%1:18:00:: I interviewed believed , unlike the younger ones , that Jewish students---student%1:18:00:: tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts---counterpart%1:09:00:: .
The percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of Jewish girls---girl%1:18:00:: who attend college---college%1:14:00:: is almost as high as that of boys---boy%1:18:00:: .
The motivations---motivation%1:03:00:: for both sexes---sex%1:14:00:: , to be sure , are different .
The vocational motive---motive%1:03:00:: is the dominant one for boys---boy%1:18:00:: , while Jewish girls---girl%1:18:00:: attend college---college%1:14:00:: for social reasons---reason%1:16:00:: and to become culturally developed .
One of the significant developments---development%1:11:01:: in American Jewish life---life%1:26:01:: is that the cultural consumers---consumer%1:18:00:: are largely the women---woman%1:18:00:: .
It is they who read - and make - Jewish best-sellers---best_seller%1:10:00:: and then persuade their husbands---husband%1:18:00:: to read them .
In upper teen Jewish life---life%1:26:01:: , the non college---college%1:14:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: tends to have a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of marginality---marginality%1:07:00:: .
`` People---people%1:14:00:: automatically assume that I 'm in college---college%1:14:00:: '' , a nineteen year---year%1:28:01:: old machinist---machinist%1:18:00:: observed irritably .
However , among the girls---girl%1:18:00:: , there are some morale---morale%1:26:00:: enhancing compensations---compensation%1:21:00:: for not going to college---college%1:14:00:: .
The Jewish working girl---working_girl%1:18:00:: almost invariably works in an office---office%1:06:00:: - in contradistinction---contradistinction%1:09:00:: to gentile factory workers---factory_worker%1:18:00:: - and , buttressed by a respectable income---income%1:21:00:: , she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student---college_student%1:18:00:: .
She is even prone to regard the college girl---college_girl%1:18:00:: as immature .
One of the reasons---reason%1:10:01:: for the high percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of Jewish teen-agers---teenager%1:18:00:: in college---college%1:14:00:: is that a great many urban Jews---jew%1:18:00:: are enabled to attend local colleges---college%1:14:00:: at modest cost---cost%1:21:00:: .
This is particularly true in large centers---center%1:15:01:: of Jewish population---population%1:14:00:: like New York---new_york%1:15:01:: , Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: , and Philadelphia---philadelphia%1:15:00:: .
What is noteworthy about this large group---group%1:03:00:: of teen-agers---teenager%1:18:00:: is that , although their attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts---counterpart%1:09:00:: , they actually lead their lives---life%1:26:02:: in a vast self enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact---contact%1:04:02:: with the non Jewish world---world%1:14:01:: .
Perhaps the Jewish students---student%1:18:00:: at Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: - constituting 85 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of those who attend the day---day%1:28:02:: session---session%1:28:00:: - can serve as a paradigm---paradigm%1:09:00:: of the urban , lower middle class Jewish student---student%1:18:00:: .
There is , to begin , an important sex---sex%1:14:00:: difference---difference%1:07:00:: .
Typically , in a lower-middle class Jewish family---family%1:14:00:: , a son---son%1:18:00:: will be sent to an out-of-town school---school%1:14:00:: , if financial resources---resource%1:21:00:: warrant it , while the daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: will attend the local college---college%1:14:00:: .
There are two reasons---reason%1:16:00:: for this .
First , the girl---girl%1:18:00:: 's education---education%1:09:01:: has a lower priority---priority%1:26:00:: than the son---son%1:18:00:: 's .
Second , the attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: in Jewish families---family%1:14:00:: is far more protective toward the daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: than toward the son---son%1:18:00:: .
Most Jewish mothers---mother%1:18:00:: are determined to exercise vigilance---vigilance%1:09:00:: over the social and sexual lives---life%1:26:01:: of their daughters---daughter%1:18:00:: by keeping them home .
The consequence---consequence%1:19:00:: of this is that the girls---girl%1:18:00:: at Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: outnumber the boys---boy%1:18:00:: and do somewhat better academically .
One can assume that some of the brightest boys---boy%1:18:00:: are out of town---town%1:15:00:: .
Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: students---student%1:18:00:: have an ambivalent attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: toward their school---school%1:14:00:: .
On the one hand , there is a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of not having moved beyond the ambiance---ambiance%1:26:00:: of their high school---high_school%1:14:00:: .
This is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood High School---group%1:03:00:: directly across the street---street%1:06:00:: from Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: .
They have a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of marginality---marginality%1:07:00:: at being denied that special badge---badge%1:10:00:: of status---status%1:26:00:: , the out-of-town school---school%1:14:00:: .
At the same time , there is a good deal---good_deal%1:23:00:: of self---self%1:09:00:: congratulation---congratulation%1:10:00:: at attending a good college---college%1:14:00:: - they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues---virtue%1:07:03:: - and they express pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: at the cozy in-group---ingroup%1:14:00:: feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: that the college---college%1:14:00:: generates .
`` It 's people---people%1:14:00:: of your own kind---kind%1:09:00:: '' , a girl---girl%1:18:00:: remarked .
Of course , I would like to go to an out-of-town school---school%1:14:00:: where there are all kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: , but I would want lots---lots%1:23:00:: of Jewish kids---kid%1:18:00:: there '' .
For most Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: students---student%1:18:00:: , college---college%1:14:00:: is at once a perpetuation---perpetuation%1:04:00:: of their ethnic attachments---attachment%1:12:00:: and a breaking away---breaking_away%1:04:01:: from the cage---cage%1:26:00:: of neighborhood---neighborhood%1:14:00:: and family---family%1:14:00:: .
Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: is unequivocally Jewish in tone---tone%1:26:01:: , and efforts---effort%1:04:00:: to detribalize the college---college%1:14:00:: by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types---type%1:18:00:: on the faculty---faculty%1:14:00:: have been unavailing .
However , a growing intellectual sophistication---sophistication%1:09:00:: and the new certitudes---certitude%1:09:00:: imparted by courses---course%1:04:01:: in psychology---psychology%1:09:00:: and anthropology---anthropology%1:09:00:: make the students---student%1:18:00:: increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents---parent%1:18:00:: .
And the rebellion---rebellion%1:04:00:: of these third generation---generation%1:14:01:: Jews---jew%1:18:00:: is not the traditional conflict---conflict%1:04:00:: of culture---culture%1:09:00:: but , rather , a protest---protest%1:04:00:: against a culture---culture%1:09:00:: that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping .
`` As long as I 'm home , I 'll never grow up '' , a nineteen year---year%1:28:01:: old boy---boy%1:18:00:: observed sadly .
It 's so much trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: , I do n't usually bother '' .
For girls---girl%1:18:00:: , the overprotection---overprotection%1:04:00:: is far more pervasive .
Parents---parent%1:18:00:: will drive on Friday---friday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: to pick up their daughters---daughter%1:18:00:: after a sorority---sorority%1:14:00:: or House---house%1:06:00:: Plan---plan%1:09:00:: meeting---meeting%1:11:00:: .
A freshman---freshman%1:18:00:: girl---girl%1:18:00:: 's father---father%1:18:00:: not too long ago called a dean---dean%1:18:00:: at Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: and demanded the `` low-down---low-down%1:10:00:: '' on a boy---boy%1:18:00:: who was going out with his daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: .
The domestic tentacles---tentacle%1:07:00:: even extend to the choice---choice%1:04:00:: of a major field---field%1:09:00:: .
Under pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: from parents---parent%1:18:00:: , the majority---majority%1:07:00:: of Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: girls---girl%1:18:00:: major in education---education%1:04:01:: since that co-ordinates best with marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: plans---plan%1:09:00:: - limited graduate study---study%1:09:03:: requirement---requirement%1:09:00:: and convenient working hours---hours%1:28:00:: .
This means that a great many academically talented girls---girl%1:18:00:: are discouraged from pursuing graduate work---work%1:04:00:: of a more demanding nature---nature%1:07:02:: .
A kind---kind%1:09:00:: of double standard---double_standard%1:10:00:: exists here for Jewish boys---boy%1:18:00:: and girls---girl%1:18:00:: as it does in the realm---realm%1:26:01:: of sex---sex%1:04:00:: .
The breaking away---breaking_away%1:04:01:: from the prison house---prison_house%1:26:00:: of Brooklyn---brooklyn%1:15:00:: is gradual .
First , the student---student%1:18:00:: trains on his hapless parents---parent%1:18:00:: the heavy artillery---artillery%1:10:00:: of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights---insight%1:12:00:: .
Then , with the new affluence---affluence%1:26:00:: , there is actually a sallying forth---sallying_forth%1:04:00:: into the wide , wide world---world%1:17:00:: beyond the precincts---precinct%1:15:00:: of New York---new_york%1:15:01:: .
It is significant that the Catskills---location%1:03:00:: , which used to be the summer---summer%1:28:00:: playground---playground%1:15:00:: for older teen-agers---teenager%1:18:00:: , a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of summer---summer%1:28:00:: suburb---suburb%1:15:00:: of New York---new_york%1:15:01:: , no longer attracts them in great numbers---number%1:07:00:: - except for those who work there as waiters---waiter%1:18:00:: , bus boys---busboy%1:18:00:: , or counselors---counselor%1:18:02:: in the day camps---day_camp%1:06:00:: .
The great world---world%1:17:02:: beyond beckons .
But it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places---watering_place%1:15:00:: - Fire Island---location%1:03:00:: , Nantucket---location%1:03:00:: , Westhampton---location%1:03:00:: , Long Island---long_island%1:15:00:: , for example - tend to be homogeneously Jewish .
Although Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: does not yet have a junior year---year%1:28:01:: abroad program---program%1:09:00:: , a good number---number%1:07:00:: of students---student%1:18:00:: spend summers---summer%1:28:00:: in Europe---europe%1:17:00:: .
Although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior year---year%1:28:02:: abroad program , a good number of students spend summers in Europe .
In general , however , the timetable---timetable%1:10:01:: of travel---travel%1:04:00:: lags considerably behind that of the student---student%1:18:00:: at Harvard---harvard%1:06:00:: or Smith---group%1:03:00:: .
And acculturation---acculturation%1:04:00:: into the world at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: student---student%1:18:00:: after college---college%1:14:00:: rather than during the four school years---school_year%1:28:00:: .
Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: is Marjorie Morningstar---person%1:03:00:: territory---territory%1:09:00:: , as much as the Bronx or Central Park West---location%1:03:00:: .
There are hordes---horde%1:14:00:: of nubile young women---young_woman%1:18:00:: there who , prodded by their impatient mothers---mother%1:18:00:: , are determined to marry .
It is interesting that , although the percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of married students---student%1:18:00:: is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn---group%1:03:00:: than elsewhere - about 30 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the women---woman%1:18:00:: and 25 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the men---man%1:18:00:: in the graduating class---graduating_class%1:14:00:: - the anxiety---anxiety%1:12:00:: of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate---estimate%1:09:00:: .
`` Almost everybody in the senior class---senior_class%1:14:00:: is married '' , students---student%1:18:00:: say dogmatically .
And the school---school%1:14:00:: newspaper---newspaper%1:14:00:: sells space---space%1:10:01:: to jubilant fraternities---fraternity%1:14:01:: , sororities---sorority%1:14:00:: , and houses---house%1:06:00:: ( in the House Plan Association---group%1:03:00:: ) that have good news---news%1:10:01:: to impart .
These announcements---announcement%1:10:00:: are , in effect , advertisements---advertisement%1:10:00:: for themselves as thriving marriage marts---marriage_mart%1:14:00:: .
There are boxed proclamations---proclamation%1:10:00:: in the newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: of watchings---watching%1:04:00:: , pinnings---pinning%1:10:00:: , ringings---ringing%1:10:00:: , engagements---engagement%1:10:00:: , and marriages---marriage%1:04:00:: in a scrupulously graded hierarchy---hierarchy%1:14:00:: of felicity---felicity%1:07:00:: .
`` Witt House---group%1:03:00:: happily announces the engagement---engagement%1:10:00:: of Fran Horowitz---person%1:03:00:: to Erwin Schwartz---person%1:03:00:: of Fife House---group%1:03:00:: '' .
The Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: student---student%1:18:00:: shows some striking departures---departure%1:11:01:: from prevailing collegiate models---model%1:09:01:: .
The Ivy League---group%1:03:00:: enjoys no easy dominion---dominion%1:26:00:: here , and the boys---boy%1:18:00:: are as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion---fashion%1:07:00:: , or even in nondescript working class manner---manner%1:07:02:: , as they are in the restrained , button-down Ivy---group%1:03:00:: way---way%1:07:01:: .
The girls---girl%1:18:00:: are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts---counterpart%1:09:00:: out of town---town%1:15:00:: , and eye shadow---eyeshadow%1:06:00:: , mascara---mascara%1:06:00:: , and elaborate bouffant hairdos---hairdo%1:08:00:: - despite the admonitions---admonition%1:10:01:: of cautious guidance---guidance%1:04:01:: personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: - are not unknown even in early morning classes---class%1:04:00:: .
Among the boys---boy%1:18:00:: , there is very little bravado---bravado%1:10:00:: about drinking---drinking%1:04:01:: .
Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: is distinctive for not having an official drinking---drinking%1:04:01:: place---place%1:15:04:: .
The Fort Lauderdale---location%1:03:00:: encampment---encampment%1:15:00:: for drinking---drinking%1:04:01:: is foreign to most Brooklyn College---group%1:03:00:: boys---boy%1:18:00:: .
Another recent achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: was the successful development---development%1:22:02:: of a method---method%1:09:00:: for the complete combustion---combustion%1:22:00:: in a bomb calorimeter---bomb_calorimeter%1:06:00:: of a metal---metal%1:27:00:: in fluorine---fluorine%1:27:00:: when the product---product%1:27:00:: is relatively non-volatile .
This work---work%1:06:00:: gave a heat of formation---heat_of_formation%1:19:00:: of aluminum---aluminum%1:27:00:: fluoride---fluoride%1:27:00:: which closely substantiates a value---value%1:09:00:: which had been determined by a less direct method---method%1:09:00:: , and raises this property---property%1:07:00:: to 15 percent---percent%1:24:00:: above that accepted a few years---year%1:28:01:: ago .
Similar measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: are being initiated to resolve a large discrepancy---discrepancy%1:07:00:: in the heat of formation---heat_of_formation%1:19:00:: of another important combustion---combustion%1:22:00:: product---product%1:06:00:: , beryllium---beryllium%1:27:00:: fluoride---fluoride%1:27:00:: .
The development---development%1:04:01:: and testing---testing%1:04:00:: of new apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: to measure other properties---property%1:07:00:: is nearing completion .
In one---one%1:23:00:: of these , an exploding wire---wire%1:06:01:: device---device%1:06:00:: to study systems---system%1:06:00:: thermodynamically up to 6000 * * f---f%1:23:02:: and 100 atmospheres---atmosphere%1:23:00:: pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: , a major goal---goal%1:09:00:: was achieved .
The accuracy---accuracy%1:07:02:: of measuring the total electrical energy---energy%1:19:00:: entering an exploding wire---wire%1:06:01:: during a few microseconds---microsecond%1:28:00:: was verified when two independent types---type%1:09:00:: of comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: with the heat energy---heat_energy%1:19:00:: produced had an uncertainty---uncertainty%1:07:00:: of less than 2 percent---percent%1:24:00:: .
This agreement---agreement%1:07:00:: is considered very good for such short time---time%1:28:05:: intervals---interval%1:28:00:: .
The method---method%1:09:00:: of calibration---calibration%1:04:00:: employs a fixed resistance---resistance%1:19:01:: element---element%1:06:00:: as a calorimeter---calorimeter%1:06:00:: .
The element---element%1:06:00:: is inserted in the discharge---discharge%1:04:04:: circuit---circuit%1:06:00:: in place of the exploding wire---wire%1:06:01:: , and the calorimetric heating---heating%1:22:00:: of the element---element%1:06:00:: is measured with high accuracy---accuracy%1:07:02:: .
This is used as a reference---reference%1:10:06:: for comparing the ohmic heating---heating%1:22:00:: and the electrical energy---energy%1:19:00:: obtained from the measured current---current%1:19:01:: through the element---element%1:06:00:: and the measured voltage---voltage%1:19:01:: across the element---element%1:09:00:: .
A high-speed shutter---shutter%1:06:01:: has been developed in order to permit photographic observation---observation%1:04:01:: of any portion---portion%1:06:00:: of the electrical wire---wire%1:06:00:: explosion---explosion%1:11:00:: .
The shutter---shutter%1:06:01:: consists of two parts---part%1:06:00:: : a fast opening---opening%1:04:01:: part---part%1:06:00:: and a fast closing---closing%1:04:01:: part---part%1:06:00:: .
Using Edgerton---person%1:03:00:: 's method---method%1:09:00:: , the fast closing action---action%1:26:00:: is obtained from the blackening---blackening%1:04:00:: of a window---window%1:06:00:: by exploding a series---series%1:14:00:: of parallel lead---lead%1:27:00:: wires---wire%1:06:00:: .
The fast opening of the shutter---shutter%1:06:01:: consists of a piece---piece%1:06:00:: of aluminum foil---aluminum_foil%1:06:00:: ( approximately * * f ) placed directly in front of the camera lens---camera_lens%1:06:00:: so that no light---light%1:19:00:: may pass into the camera---camera%1:06:00:: .
The opening---opening%1:04:02:: action---action%1:26:00:: is obtained when a capacitor---capacitor%1:06:00:: , charged to high voltage---voltage%1:19:01:: , is suddenly discharged through the foil---foil%1:06:01:: .
During the discharge---discharge%1:19:00:: the magnetic forces---magnetic_force%1:19:00:: set up by the passage---passage%1:08:00:: of current---current%1:19:01:: cause the edges---edge%1:15:00:: of the foil---foil%1:06:01:: to roll inward toward its center line---center_line%1:25:00:: , thus allowing light---light%1:19:00:: to pass into the camera---camera%1:06:00:: .
Experiments---experiment%1:09:00:: have shown that the shutter---shutter%1:06:01:: is 75 percent---percent%1:24:00:: open in about 60 - 80 microseconds---microsecond%1:28:00:: .
The shutter---shutter%1:06:01:: aperture---aperture%1:06:01:: may be made larger or smaller by changing the foil---foil%1:06:01:: area---area%1:07:00:: and adjusting the electrical energy---energy%1:19:00:: input---input%1:10:00:: to the foil---foil%1:06:01:: .
Besides the well-known hydrogen---hydrogen%1:27:00:: line---line%1:19:00:: at 21 cm---cm%1:23:00:: wavelength---wavelength%1:07:00:: , the spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: of extraterrestrial radio sources---radio_source%1:17:00:: may contain sharp lines---line%1:19:00:: characteristic of other atoms---atom%1:27:00:: , ions---ion%1:17:00:: , and small molecules---molecule%1:27:00:: .
The detection---detection%1:09:00:: and study---study%1:04:00:: of such line---line%1:19:00:: spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: would add considerably to present information---information%1:10:00:: on interstellar gas---gas%1:26:00:: clouds---cloud%1:19:01:: and , perhaps , planetary atmospheres---atmosphere%1:15:00:: .
Among the most likely producers---producer%1:11:00:: of detectable radio---radio%1:10:00:: line---line%1:19:00:: spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: are the light diatomic hydrides---hydride%1:27:00:: OH and CH ; somewhat less likely sources---source%1:15:00:: are the heavier hydrides---hydride%1:27:00:: SH , SiH , and ScH .
Very small concentrations---concentration%1:07:02:: of these hydrides---hydride%1:27:00:: should be detectable ; in interstellar gas---gas%1:26:00:: , concentrations---concentration%1:07:02:: as low as * * f molecules---molecule%1:27:00:: / * * f may be sufficient , as compared to the * * f hydrogen atoms---hydrogen_atom%1:27:00:: * * f required for detection---detection%1:09:00:: of the 21 - cm---cm%1:23:00:: line---line%1:19:00:: .
High sensitivity---sensitivity%1:09:00:: in radio telescopes---radio_telescope%1:06:00:: is achieved by reducing the bandwidth---bandwidth%1:23:00:: of the receiver---receiver%1:06:00:: ; therefore , only with precise foreknowledge---foreknowledge%1:10:00:: of the line---line%1:19:00:: frequencies---frequency%1:28:00:: is an astronomical search---search%1:04:02:: for the radio spectra---radio_spectrum%1:19:00:: of these molecules---molecule%1:27:00:: feasible .
To secure precise measurements of these frequencies---frequency%1:28:00:: , a research---research%1:04:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: in free radical---free_radical%1:27:00:: microwave---microwave%1:19:00:: spectroscopy---spectroscopy%1:04:00:: has been started .
Since conventional methods---method%1:09:00:: are insensitive at the low frequencies---low_frequency%1:07:01:: of these molecular transitions---transition%1:11:01:: , the paramagnetic resonance---resonance%1:19:00:: method---method%1:09:00:: is being used instead .
This involves the application---application%1:04:03:: of a strong magnetic field---magnetic_field%1:19:00:: to the radical---radical%1:27:02:: vapor---vapor%1:22:00:: , which shifts the low-frequency---low_frequency%1:07:01:: spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: to a conveniently high microwave---microwave%1:19:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: , where they may be measured with optimum sensitivity---sensitivity%1:07:00:: .
The first diatomic hydride---hydride%1:27:00:: investigated by the paramagnetic resonance---resonance%1:19:00:: method---method%1:09:00:: was the OH radical---radical%1:27:02:: .
Results---result%1:11:00:: of this experiment---experiment%1:09:00:: include the frequencies---frequency%1:28:00:: of the two strong spectral lines---line%1:19:00:: by which OH may be identified in interstellar gas---gas%1:26:00:: ; the frequencies---frequency%1:28:00:: are 1665.32 and 1667.36 * * f , with an uncertainty---uncertainty%1:07:00:: of 0.10 * * f .
Success---success%1:04:00:: in observing these spectral lines---line%1:19:00:: has so far , apparently , been confined to the laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: ; extraterrestrial observations---observation%1:04:01:: have yet to be reported .
Preparations---preparation%1:09:00:: are being made for similar experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: on CH and SH radicals---radical%1:27:02:: .
The Bureau---group%1:03:00:: is pursuing an active program---program%1:09:01:: to provide a temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: scale---scale%1:24:03:: and thermometer---thermometer%1:06:00:: calibration---calibration%1:04:00:: services---service%1:04:00:: in the range---range%1:07:00:: 1.5 to 20 * * f .
The efforts---effort%1:04:00:: and accomplishments---accomplishment%1:04:00:: fall into three main categories---category%1:09:02:: : absolute thermometry---thermometry%1:04:00:: based upon the velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: of sound---sound%1:19:00:: in helium---helium%1:27:00:: gas---gas%1:26:00:: , secondary thermometry---thermometry%1:04:00:: involving principally studies---study%1:09:03:: of the behavior---behavior%1:26:00:: of germanium---germanium%1:27:00:: resistors---resistor%1:06:00:: , and helium---helium%1:27:00:: 4 vapor-pressure---vapor_pressure%1:19:00:: measurements ( see p. 144 ) .
An acoustical interferometer---interferometer%1:06:00:: has been constructed and used , with helium---helium%1:27:00:: gas---gas%1:27:00:: as the thermometric fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: , to measure temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: near 4.2 and 2.1 * * f .
Such an interferometer---interferometer%1:06:00:: provides a means---means%1:04:00:: of absolute temperature---absolute_temperature%1:07:00:: measurement---measurement%1:04:00:: , and may be used as an alternative to the gas thermometer---gas_thermometer%1:06:00:: .
When values---value%1:09:00:: of temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: derived with this instrument---instrument%1:04:00:: were compared with the accepted values---value%1:09:00:: associated with liquid helium---helium%1:27:00:: 4 vapor pressures---vapor_pressure%1:19:00:: , differences of about 10 and 7 millidegrees---millidegree%1:23:00:: respectively were found .
This result---result%1:11:00:: is preliminary , and work---work%1:04:00:: is continuing .
Carbon---carbon%1:27:00:: resistors---resistor%1:06:00:: and impurity---impurity%1:27:00:: doped germanium---germanium%1:27:00:: resistors---resistor%1:06:00:: have been investigated for use---use%1:04:00:: as precision---precision%1:07:00:: secondary thermometers---thermometer%1:06:00:: in the liquid helium---helium%1:27:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: region---region%1:15:00:: .
Several germanium---germanium%1:27:00:: resistors---resistor%1:06:00:: have been thermally cycled from 300 to 4.2 * * f and their resistances---resistance%1:19:01:: have been found to be reproducible within 1 3 millidegree---millidegree%1:23:00:: when temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: were derived from a vapor pressure---vapor_pressure%1:19:00:: thermometer---thermometer%1:06:00:: whose tubing---tubing%1:06:00:: is jacketed through most of the liquid helium---helium%1:27:00:: .
Preliminary calibrations---calibration%1:04:00:: of the resistors---resistor%1:06:00:: have been made from 4.21 to 2.16 * * f at every 0.1 * * f .
The estimated standard deviations---standard_deviation%1:09:00:: of the data---datum%1:09:00:: for two of the resistors---resistor%1:06:00:: were 1 millidegree---millidegree%1:23:00:: ; and for the third resistor---resistor%1:06:00:: , 3.3 millidegrees---millidegree%1:23:00:: .
The reproducibilities---reproducibility%1:07:00:: of helium---helium%1:27:00:: vapor-pressure---vapor_pressure%1:19:00:: thermometers---thermometer%1:06:00:: have been investigated in conjunction---conjunction%1:07:00:: with a `` constant temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: '' liquid helium---helium%1:27:00:: bath---bath%1:06:02:: from 4.2 to 1.8 * * f .
Surface---surface%1:15:00:: temperature gradients---temperature_gradient%1:24:00:: have been found to exist in liquid helium---helium%1:27:00:: baths---bath%1:06:02:: contained in 15 - and 25 - liter---liter%1:23:00:: metallic storage---storage%1:04:01:: dewars---dewar%1:06:00:: .
The gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: was about one half---one-half%1:23:00:: of a millidegree---millidegree%1:23:00:: at 4.2 * * f but increased to several millidegrees---millidegree%1:23:00:: for bath---bath%1:06:02:: temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: slightly greater than the |---one%1:23:00:: l---l%1:23:00:: point---point%1:26:00:: .
A hydrostatic head---hydrostatic_head%1:19:00:: correction---correction%1:23:00:: has been neither necessary nor applicable in the determination---determination%1:04:00:: of vapor pressures---vapor_pressure%1:19:00:: or temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: for the bulk---bulk%1:07:02:: liquid helium---helium%1:27:00:: .
However , the surface---surface%1:15:00:: temperature gradient---temperature_gradient%1:24:00:: can produce erroneous vapor-pressure---vapor_pressure%1:19:00:: measurements for the bulk---bulk%1:07:02:: liquid helium---helium%1:27:00:: unless precautions---precaution%1:04:00:: are taken to isolate the tube---tube%1:06:00:: ( which passes through the surface---surface%1:15:00:: to the vapor pressure---vapor_pressure%1:19:00:: bulb---bulb%1:06:01:: ) from the liquid helium---helium%1:27:00:: surface---surface%1:15:00:: .
It has also been observed , in helium---helium%1:27:00:: 2 , , that large discrepancies---discrepancy%1:07:00:: can exist between surface---surface%1:15:00:: vapor pressures---vapor_pressure%1:19:00:: and those pressures---pressure%1:19:00:: measured by a vapor pressure---vapor_pressure%1:19:00:: thermometer---thermometer%1:06:00:: .
This has been attributed to helium---helium%1:27:00:: film---film%1:06:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: in the vapor pressure---vapor_pressure%1:19:00:: thermometer---thermometer%1:06:00:: .
In this case---case%1:26:00:: also the design---design%1:09:01:: of the thermometer---thermometer%1:06:00:: can be modified to reduce the helium---helium%1:27:00:: film---film%1:06:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: .
Precise pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: volume---volume%1:23:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: measurements on corrosive gases---gas%1:26:00:: are dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: transducer---transducer%1:06:00:: .
A prototype---prototype%1:09:00:: which fulfills the requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: was developed and thoroughly tested .
The transducer---transducer%1:06:00:: is a null type---type%1:09:00:: instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: and employs a stretched diaphragm---diaphragm%1:06:00:: , 0.001 in.---in%1:23:00:: thick and 1 in.---in%1:23:00:: in diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: .
A small pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: unbalance---unbalance%1:26:00:: displaces the diaphragm---diaphragm%1:06:00:: and changes the capacitance---capacitance%1:19:00:: between the diaphragm---diaphragm%1:06:00:: and an electrically insulated plate---plate%1:06:02:: spaced 0.001 in.---in%1:23:00:: apart ( for * * f ) .
Spherical concave backing---backing%1:06:00:: surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: support the diaphragm---diaphragm%1:06:00:: when excessive pressures---pressure%1:19:00:: are applied and prevent the stresses---stress%1:19:00:: within the diaphragm---diaphragm%1:06:00:: from exceeding the elastic limit---limit%1:07:00:: .
Over a temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: from 25 to 200 * * f and at pressures---pressure%1:19:00:: up to 250 atm---atm%1:23:00:: , an overload---overload%1:06:02:: of 300 psi---psi%1:23:00:: , applied for a period---period%1:28:00:: of one day---day%1:28:00:: , results in an uncertainty---uncertainty%1:07:00:: in the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: of , at most , one millimeter of mercury---millimeter_of_mercury%1:23:00:: .
A 6 - year---year%1:28:01:: study---study%1:04:00:: of the transport---transport%1:06:00:: properties---property%1:07:00:: of air---air%1:27:00:: at elevated temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: has been completed .
This project---project%1:04:00:: was carried out under sponsorship---sponsorship%1:04:01:: of the Ballistic Missile Division of the Air Research and Development Command---group%1:03:00:: , U. S. Air Force---group%1:03:00:: , and had as its goal---goal%1:09:00:: the investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: of the transport---transport%1:22:00:: by diffusion---diffusion%1:22:00:: of the heat energy---heat_energy%1:19:00:: of chemical---chemical%1:27:00:: binding---binding%1:07:00:: .
A significant effect---effect%1:19:00:: discovered during the study---study%1:04:00:: is the existence---existence%1:26:00:: of Prandtl---person%1:03:00:: numbers---number%1:23:00:: reaching values---value%1:09:00:: of more than unity---unity%1:23:00:: in the nitrogen---nitrogen%1:27:00:: dissociation---dissociation%1:04:00:: region---region%1:15:00:: .
Another effect---effect%1:19:00:: discovered is the large coefficient---coefficient%1:23:00:: of thermal diffusion---diffusion%1:22:00:: tending to separate nitrogen---nitrogen%1:27:00:: from the oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: when temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: differences---difference%1:11:00:: straddling the nitrogen---nitrogen%1:27:00:: dissociation---dissociation%1:04:00:: region---region%1:15:00:: are present .
The results---result%1:19:00:: of the study---study%1:04:00:: , based on collision integrals---integral%1:09:00:: computed from the latest critically evaluated data---data%1:14:00:: on intermolecular forces---force%1:19:00:: in air---air%1:27:00:: , will be reported in the form---form%1:09:00:: of a table---table%1:14:00:: of viscosity---viscosity%1:07:00:: , thermal conductivity---conductivity%1:19:00:: , thermal diffusion---diffusion%1:22:00:: , and diffusion---diffusion%1:22:00:: coefficients---coefficient%1:23:00:: at temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: of 1000 to 10000 * * f and of logarithm---logarithm%1:10:00:: of pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: in atmospheres---atmosphere%1:23:00:: from * * f---f%1:23:02:: to * * f---f%1:23:02:: times normal density---density%1:07:00:: .
In March---march%1:28:00:: , 1961 , representatives---representative%1:18:00:: of the national laboratories---laboratory%1:06:00:: of Australia---australia%1:15:00:: , Canada---canada%1:15:00:: , The Netherlands---the_netherlands%1:15:00:: , United Kingdom---united_kingdom%1:15:00:: , U. S. S. R.---location%1:03:00:: , United States---united_states%1:15:00:: , and West Germany---location%1:03:00:: , met at the NBS---group%1:03:00:: to devise means---means%1:04:00:: for reaching international agreement---agreement%1:26:01:: on a temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: scale---scale%1:24:03:: between 10 and 90 * * f---f%1:23:02:: .
As a first step---first_step%1:04:00:: toward this goal---goal%1:09:00:: , arrangements---arrangement%1:09:01:: were worked out for comparing the scales---scale%1:24:03:: now in use through circulation---circulation%1:10:00:: of a group---group%1:03:00:: of standard platinum---platinum%1:27:00:: resistance thermometers---resistance_thermometer%1:06:00:: for calibration---calibration%1:04:00:: by each national laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: .
Such a group---group%1:03:00:: of thermometers---thermometer%1:06:00:: was obtained and calibrated at the NBS---group%1:03:00:: .
These thermometers---thermometer%1:06:00:: have now been sent to the United Kingdom---united_kingdom%1:15:00:: for calibration---calibration%1:04:00:: at the National Physical Laboratory---location%1:03:00:: .
During the last week---week%1:28:00:: of march---march%1:28:00:: 1961 , Columbus---columbus%1:15:00:: , Ohio---ohio%1:15:00:: was the site---site%1:15:00:: of the Fourth Symposium on Temperature---group%1:03:00:: , Its Measurement and Control in Science and Industry---group%1:03:00:: .
The Symposium---symposium%1:14:00:: , which was jointly sponsored by the American Institute of Physics , the Instrument Society of America , and the National Bureau of Standards , attracted nearly one thousand registrants---registrant%1:18:00:: , including many from abroad .
The Bureau---group%1:03:00:: contributed to the planning---planning%1:04:00:: and success---success%1:26:00:: of the Symposium through the efforts---effort%1:04:00:: of Mr. W. A. Wildhack---person%1:03:00:: , General Chairman---person%1:03:00:: , and Dr. C. M. Herzfeld---person%1:03:00:: , Program Chairman---person%1:03:00:: .
Dr. A. V. Astin---person%1:03:00:: , NBS Director---person%1:03:00:: , opened the 5 - day---day%1:28:00:: session---session%1:10:00:: with introductory remarks---remark%1:10:00:: , following which a total---total%1:06:00:: of twenty-six papers---paper%1:10:01:: were given throughout the week---week%1:28:00:: by NBS---group%1:03:00:: scientists---scientist%1:18:00:: , from both the Washington---washington%1:15:01:: and Boulder Laboratories---group%1:03:00:: .
In addition to the basic programs---program%1:09:01:: in wavelength---wavelength%1:07:00:: standards---standard%1:10:00:: , spectroscopy---spectroscopy%1:04:00:: , solid state physics---physics%1:09:00:: , interactions---interaction%1:04:00:: of the free electron---electron%1:17:00:: and atomic constants---constant%1:09:00:: which are necessary to provide the foundation---foundation%1:24:00:: for technological progress---progress%1:04:01:: , the Bureau---group%1:03:00:: has strengthened its activities---activity%1:04:00:: in laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: astrophysics---astrophysics%1:09:00:: .
The programs---program%1:09:01:: in infrared spectroscopy---spectroscopy%1:04:00:: are undergoing reorientation---reorientation%1:09:00:: toward wavelength---wavelength%1:07:00:: standards---standard%1:10:00:: in the far infrared---infrared%1:07:00:: , the application---application%1:04:02:: of infrared techniques---technique%1:09:00:: to solid state studies---study%1:04:00:: , and increased emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: on high resolution---resolution%1:09:00:: instrumentation---instrumentation%1:06:00:: .
Two data---data%1:14:00:: centers---center%1:06:00:: have been established for the collection---collection%1:04:00:: , indexing---indexing%1:04:00:: , critical evaluation---evaluation%1:09:00:: , and dissemination---dissemination%1:10:00:: of bibliographies---bibliography%1:10:00:: and critical values---value%1:09:00:: in the fields---field%1:09:00:: of transition---transition%1:04:00:: probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: and collision---collision%1:11:01:: cross sections---cross_section%1:15:00:: .
Under the sponsorship---sponsorship%1:04:01:: of the Office of Naval Research---group%1:03:00:: and the Advanced Research Projects Agency---group%1:03:00:: , a data---data%1:14:00:: center---center%1:06:00:: was established to gather and index all published information---information%1:09:00:: on atomic transition---transition%1:04:00:: probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: .
An exhaustive survey---survey%1:04:02:: was made of the literature---literature%1:10:01:: , and a primary reference---reference%1:10:04:: file---file%1:10:00:: of approximately 600 references---reference%1:10:04:: was catalogued .
Selected bibliographies---bibliography%1:10:00:: and tables---table%1:14:00:: of available data---data%1:14:00:: are now in preparation---preparation%1:04:02:: .
A wall---wall%1:06:00:: stabilized high current---current%1:19:01:: arc---arc%1:19:00:: source---source%1:15:00:: was constructed and used to study transition---transition%1:04:00:: probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: of atomic hydrogen---hydrogen%1:27:00:: and oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: .
This apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: will also be used to measure transition---transition%1:04:00:: probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: of a large number---large_number%1:23:00:: of other elements---element%1:27:00:: .
A study---study%1:04:00:: of the hydrogen---hydrogen%1:27:00:: line---line%1:19:00:: profiles---profile%1:10:01:: indicates that a measurement of these profiles---profile%1:10:01:: can be used to calculate a temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: for the arc---arc%1:19:00:: plasma that is reliable to about * * f percent---percent%1:24:00:: .
A set---set%1:14:00:: of tables---table%1:14:00:: containing spectral intensities---intensity%1:07:03:: for 39000 lines---line%1:19:00:: of 70 elements---element%1:27:00:: , as observed in a copper---copper%1:27:00:: matrix---matrix%1:14:00:: in a d-c---dc%1:19:00:: arc---arc%1:19:00:: , was completed and published .
Studies---study%1:04:00:: of the intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: data---data%1:14:00:: indicate that they may be converted to approximate transition---transition%1:04:00:: probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: .
These data---data%1:14:00:: are not of the precision---precision%1:07:00:: obtainable by the methods---method%1:09:00:: previously mentioned , but the vast number---number%1:23:00:: of approximate values---value%1:09:00:: available will be useful in many areas---area%1:09:00:: .
Research---research%1:04:00:: continues on the very complex spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: of the rare earth---rare_earth%1:27:00:: elements---element%1:27:00:: .
New computer---computer%1:06:00:: and automation---automation%1:04:00:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: were applied to these spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: with considerable success---success%1:04:00:: .
Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: 's feeling of identity with Sara Sullam---person%1:03:00:: was crowned by her discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: of the coincidence---coincidence%1:11:00:: that Sara---person%1:03:00:: 's epitaph---epitaph%1:10:00:: in the Jewish cemetery---cemetery%1:15:00:: in Venice---venice%1:15:00:: referred to her as `` the Sulamite '' .
Into the texture---texture%1:09:00:: of this tapestry---tapestry%1:07:00:: of history---history%1:28:02:: and human drama---drama%1:11:00:: Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: , as every artist---artist%1:18:00:: delights to do , wove strands---strand%1:09:00:: of her own intuitive insights---insight%1:09:02:: into human nature---nature%1:07:02:: and - especially in the remarkable story---story%1:10:03:: of the attraction---attraction%1:07:00:: and conflict---conflict%1:26:00:: between two so disparate and fervent characters---character%1:18:00:: as this pair---pair%1:14:00:: - into the relations---relations%1:24:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: and women---woman%1:18:00:: : `` In their relations---relations%1:24:00:: , she was the giver---giver%1:18:01:: and he the receiver---receiver%1:18:00:: , nay the demander---demander%1:18:00:: .
His feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: always exacted sacrifices---sacrifice%1:04:01:: from her .
One is so accustomed to think of men---man%1:18:00:: as the privileged who need but ask and receive , and women---woman%1:18:00:: as submissive and yielding , that our sympathies---sympathy%1:09:00:: are usually enlisted on the side---side%1:14:00:: of the man---man%1:18:00:: whose love---love%1:12:00:: is not returned , and we condemn the woman---woman%1:18:00:: as a coquette---coquette%1:18:00:: .
The very firmness---firmness%1:07:01:: of her convictions---conviction%1:09:00:: and logical clearness---clearness%1:07:01:: of her arguments---argument%1:10:02:: captivated and stimulated him to make greater efforts---effort%1:04:00:: ; usually , this is most exasperating to men---man%1:18:00:: , who expect every woman---woman%1:18:00:: to verify their preconceived notions---preconceived_notion%1:09:00:: concerning her sex---sex%1:14:00:: , and when she does not , immediately condemn her as eccentric and unwomanly .
She had the opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: that few clever women---woman%1:18:00:: can resist , of showing her superiority---superiority%1:07:00:: in argument---argument%1:10:00:: over a man---man%1:18:00:: .
Women---woman%1:18:00:: themselves have come to look upon matters---matter%1:09:01:: in the same light---light%1:09:01:: as the outside world---world%1:09:00:: , and scarcely find any wrong---wrong%1:07:01:: in submitting to the importunities---importunity%1:10:00:: of a stronger will---will%1:09:00:: , even when their affections---affection%1:12:00:: are withheld .
She was exposing herself to temptation---temptation%1:09:00:: which it is best to avoid where it can consistently be done .
One who invites such trials---trial%1:09:00:: of character---character%1:07:01:: is either foolhardy , overconfident or too simple and childlike in faith---faith%1:09:01:: in mankind to see the danger---danger%1:26:00:: .
In any case---case%1:11:00:: but the last , such a course---course%1:17:00:: is sure to avenge itself upon the individual---individual%1:03:00:: ; the moral powers---power%1:09:01:: no more than the physical and mental , can bear overstraining .
And , in the last case---case%1:11:00:: , a bitter disappointment---disappointment%1:12:00:: but too often meets the confiding nature---nature%1:07:02:: '' .
Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: was discovering in the process---process%1:04:00:: of writing , as the born writer---writer%1:18:00:: does , not merely a channel---channel%1:10:00:: for the discharge---discharge%1:04:04:: of accumulated information---information%1:09:00:: but a stimulus---stimulus%1:09:00:: to the development---development%1:22:02:: of the creative powers---power%1:09:01:: of observation---observation%1:04:01:: , insight---insight%1:12:00:: and intuition---intuition%1:09:00:: .
Dr. Isaacs---person%1:03:00:: was so pleased with the quality---quality%1:07:02:: of her biographical study---study%1:10:00:: of Sara Sullam---person%1:03:00:: that he considered submitting it to the Century Magazine or Harper 's but he decided that its Jewish subject---subject%1:09:01:: probably would not interest them and published it in The Messenger , `` so our readers---reader%1:18:02:: will be benefited instead '' .
Under her father---father%1:18:00:: 's influence---influence%1:07:00:: it did not occur to Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: that she might write on subjects---subject%1:09:01:: outside the Jewish field---field%1:09:00:: , but she did begin writing for other Anglo Jewish papers---paper%1:10:03:: and thus increased her output---output%1:06:00:: and her audience---audience%1:14:01:: .
And she wrote the libretto---libretto%1:10:00:: for an oratorio---oratorio%1:10:00:: on the subject---subject%1:10:00:: of Judas Maccabeus---person%1:03:00:: performed at the Hanukkah---hanukkah%1:28:00:: festival---festival%1:28:00:: which came in December---december%1:28:00:: .
By her eighteenth birthday---birthday%1:28:00:: her bent---bent%1:09:01:: for writing---writing%1:04:02:: was so evident that Papa---papa%1:18:00:: and Mamma---mamma%1:18:00:: gave her a Life of Dickens as a spur---spur%1:10:00:: to her aspiration---aspiration%1:07:00:: .
Another source---source%1:06:00:: of intellectual stimulus---stimulus%1:09:00:: was opened to her at that time---time%1:28:00:: by the founding---founding%1:04:00:: of Johns Hopkins University---group%1:03:00:: within walking distance---distance%1:07:00:: of home---home%1:15:04:: .
It was established in a couple of buildings---building%1:06:00:: in the shopping---shopping%1:04:00:: district---district%1:15:00:: , with only a few professors---professor%1:18:00:: , but all eminent men---man%1:18:00:: , and a few hundred eager students---student%1:18:00:: housed in nearby dwellings---dwelling%1:06:00:: .
In September---september%1:28:00:: ' 76 Thomas Huxley---person%1:03:00:: , Darwin---darwin%1:18:00:: 's famous disciple---disciple%1:18:00:: , came from England---england%1:15:00:: to speak in a crowded auditorium---auditorium%1:06:00:: at the formal opening---opening%1:11:01:: of the University---university%1:06:00:: ; and although it was a school---school%1:14:00:: for men---man%1:18:00:: only , it afforded Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: an opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to attend its public lectures---public_lecture%1:10:00:: .
In the following year---year%1:28:01:: her father---father%1:18:00:: undertook to give a course---course%1:04:01:: in Hebrew theology---theology%1:09:00:: to Johns Hopkins---group%1:03:00:: students---student%1:18:00:: , and this brought to the Szold---person%1:03:00:: house---house%1:06:00:: a group---group%1:03:00:: of bright young Jews---jew%1:18:00:: who had come to Baltimore---baltimore%1:15:00:: to study , and who enjoyed being fed and mothered by Mamma---mamma%1:18:00:: and entertained by Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: and Rachel---person%1:03:00:: , who played and sang for them in the upstairs sitting room---sitting_room%1:06:00:: on Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: evenings---evening%1:28:00:: .
From Philadelphia---philadelphia%1:15:00:: came Cyrus Adler---person%1:03:00:: and Joseph Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: .
Adler---person%1:03:00:: , Judge Sulzberger---person%1:03:00:: 's nephew---nephew%1:18:00:: , came to study Assyriology---assyriology%1:09:00:: .
A smart , shrewd and ambitious young man---man%1:18:00:: , well connected , and with a knack---knack%1:09:00:: for getting in the good graces---grace%1:07:03:: of important people---people%1:14:00:: , he was bound to go far .
Joseph Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: , the younger son---son%1:18:00:: of the distinguished rabbi---rabbi%1:18:00:: , Marcus Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: , was a friendly , round-faced fellow---fellow%1:18:00:: with a little mustache---mustache%1:08:00:: , whose field---field%1:09:00:: was psychology---psychology%1:09:00:: , and who was also a punster---punster%1:18:00:: and a jolly tease---tease%1:18:00:: .
His father---father%1:18:00:: was a good friend---friend%1:18:00:: of Rabbi Szold---person%1:03:00:: , and Joe---person%1:03:00:: lived with the Szolds---person%1:03:00:: for a while .
Both these youths---youth%1:18:00:: , who greatly admired Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: , were somewhat younger than she , as were also the neighboring Friedenwald---person%1:03:00:: boys---boy%1:18:02:: , who were then studying medicine---medicine%1:04:00:: ; and bright though they all were , they could not possibly compete for her interest---interest%1:09:00:: with Papa---papa%1:18:00:: , whose mind---mind%1:09:00:: - although he never tried to dazzle or patronize lesser lights---light%1:18:00:: with it - naturally eclipsed theirs and made them seem to her even younger than they were .
Besides , Miss Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: - as she was generally known since she had put up her hair---hair%1:08:00:: with a chignon---chignon%1:08:00:: in the back---back%1:06:00:: - had little time---time%1:28:05:: to spare them from her teaching---teaching%1:04:00:: and writing---writing%1:04:02:: ; so Cyrus Adler---person%1:03:00:: became interested in her friend---friend%1:18:00:: Racie Friedenwald---person%1:03:00:: , and Joe Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: - the only young man---young_man%1:18:00:: who when he wrote had the temerity---temerity%1:07:00:: to address her as Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: , and signed himself Joe---person%1:03:00:: - fell in love with pretty sister---sister%1:18:00:: Rachel---person%1:03:00:: .
Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: , however , was at that time---time%1:28:00:: engaged in a lengthy correspondence---correspondence%1:10:00:: with Joe---person%1:03:00:: 's older and more serious brother---brother%1:18:00:: , Morris---person%1:03:00:: , who was just about her own age---age%1:07:00:: and whom she had got to know well during trips---trip%1:04:00:: to Philadelphia---philadelphia%1:15:00:: with Papa---papa%1:18:00:: , when he substituted for Rabbi Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: at Rodeph Shalom Temple---group%1:03:00:: there during its Rabbi---rabbi%1:18:00:: 's absence---absence%1:04:00:: in Europe---europe%1:17:00:: .
Young Morris---person%1:03:00:: , who , while attending the University of Pennsylvania---group%1:03:00:: , also taught and edited a paper---paper%1:10:03:: , found time---time%1:28:05:: to write Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: twenty page---page%1:10:00:: letters---letter%1:10:00:: on everything that engaged his interest---interest%1:09:00:: , from the acting---acting%1:04:00:: of Sarah Bernhardt---person%1:03:00:: in Philadelphia---philadelphia%1:15:00:: to his reactions---reaction%1:09:00:: to the comments---comment%1:10:01:: of `` Sulamith---person%1:03:00:: '' on the Jewish reform movement---reform_movement%1:14:00:: being promulgated by the Hebrew Union College---group%1:03:00:: in Cincinnati---cincinnati%1:15:00:: .
Unlike his younger brother---brother%1:18:00:: , Joe---person%1:03:00:: , he never presumed to address her more familiarly than as `` My dear friend---friend%1:18:00:: '' , although he praised and envied the elegance---elegance%1:07:00:: and purity---purity%1:26:00:: of her style---style%1:10:00:: .
And when he complained of the lack---lack%1:26:00:: of time---time%1:28:05:: for all he wanted to do , Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: advised him to rise at five in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: as she and Papa---papa%1:18:00:: did .
One thing---thing%1:09:02:: Papa---papa%1:18:00:: had not taught Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: was how to handle a young man---young_man%1:18:00:: as high-spirited and opinionated as herself .
She could not resist the opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: `` of showing her superiority---superiority%1:07:00:: in argument---argument%1:10:03:: over a man---man%1:18:00:: '' which she had remarked as one of the `` feminine follies---folly%1:07:00:: '' of Sara Sullam---person%1:03:00:: ; and in her forthright way---way%1:07:01:: , Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: , who in her story---story%1:10:00:: of Sara---person%1:03:00:: had indicated her own unwillingness---unwillingness%1:07:00:: `` to think of men---man%1:18:00:: as the privileged '' and `` women---woman%1:18:00:: as submissive and yielding '' , felt obliged to defend vigorously any statement---statement%1:10:00:: of hers to which Morris Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: took the slightest exception - he objected to her stand---stand%1:09:00:: on the Corbin---person%1:03:00:: affair---affair%1:09:00:: , as well as on the radical reforms---reform%1:04:01:: of Dr. Wise---person%1:03:00:: of Hebrew Union College---group%1:03:00:: - until once , in sheer desperation---desperation%1:26:01:: , he wrote that he had given up hope---hope%1:12:01:: they would ever agree on anything .
But that did not prevent him from writing more long letters---letter%1:10:00:: , or from coming to spend his Christmas---christmas%1:28:01:: vacations---vacation%1:28:00:: with the hospitable , lively Szolds---person%1:03:00:: in their pleasant house---house%1:06:00:: on Lombard Street---location%1:03:00:: .
`` We 've got Father---father%1:18:00:: and Mother---mother%1:18:00:: and each other , '' said Beth---person%1:03:00:: on the first page---page%1:10:00:: of Louisa Alcott---person%1:03:00:: 's Little Women ; and , `` I do think that families---family%1:14:00:: are the most beautiful things---thing%1:26:00:: in all the world---world%1:17:01:: '' , burst out Jo---person%1:03:00:: some five hundred pages---page%1:10:00:: later in that popular story---story%1:10:00:: of the March---person%1:03:00:: family---family%1:14:00:: , which had first appeared when Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: was eight ; and the Szold---person%1:03:00:: family---family%1:14:00:: , as it developed , bore a striking resemblance---resemblance%1:07:00:: to the Marches---person%1:03:00:: .
Mr. March---person%1:03:00:: , like Benjamin Szold---person%1:03:00:: , was a clergyman---clergyman%1:18:00:: , although of an indeterminate denomination---denomination%1:14:00:: ; and `` Marmee '' March---person%1:03:00:: , like Sophie Szold---person%1:03:00:: , was the competent manager---manager%1:18:00:: of her brood---brood%1:14:00:: of girls---girl%1:18:04:: , of whom the Marches---person%1:03:00:: had only four to the Szolds---person%1:03:00:: ' five .
But the March---person%1:03:00:: girls---girl%1:18:04:: had their counterparts---counterpart%1:09:00:: in the Szold---person%1:03:00:: girls---girl%1:18:04:: .
Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: could easily identify herself with Jo March---person%1:03:00:: , although Jo---person%1:03:00:: was not the eldest sister---sister%1:18:00:: .
Neither was Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: hoydenish like Jo---person%1:03:00:: , who frankly wished she were a boy---boy%1:18:00:: and had deliberately shortened her name---name%1:10:00:: , which , like Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: 's , was the feminine form---form%1:09:01:: of a boy---boy%1:18:00:: 's name---name%1:10:00:: .
But both were high-spirited and vivacious , both had tempers---temper%1:07:02:: to control , both loved languages---language%1:10:00:: , especially English---english%1:10:00:: and German---german%1:10:00:: , both were good teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: and wrote for publication---publication%1:04:01:: .
Each was her mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's assistant---assistant%1:18:00:: and confidante---confidante%1:18:00:: ; and each stood out conspicuously in the family---family%1:14:00:: picture---picture%1:06:00:: .
Bertha Szold---person%1:03:00:: was more like Meg---person%1:03:00:: , the eldest March---person%1:03:00:: girl---girl%1:18:04:: , who `` learned that a woman---woman%1:18:00:: 's happiest kingdom---kingdom%1:15:00:: is home---home%1:15:04:: , her highest honor---honor%1:10:00:: the art---art%1:09:00:: of ruling it , not as a queen---queen%1:18:00:: , but a wise wife---wife%1:18:00:: and mother---mother%1:18:00:: '' .
Bertha---person%1:03:00:: , blue-eyed like Mamma---mamma%1:18:00:: , was from the start---start%1:11:00:: her mother---mother's_daughter%1:18:00:: 's daughter , destined for her mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's role---role%1:04:00:: in life---life%1:09:00:: .
Sadie---person%1:03:00:: , like Beth March---person%1:03:00:: , suffered ill health---ill_health%1:26:00:: - got rheumatic fever---rheumatic_fever%1:26:00:: and had to be careful of her heart---heart%1:08:00:: - but that never dampened her spirits---spirit%1:26:01:: .
When her right hand---right_hand%1:08:00:: was incapacitated by the rheumatism---rheumatism%1:26:00:: , Sadie---person%1:03:00:: learned to write with her left hand---left_hand%1:08:00:: .
She wrote gay plays---play%1:10:01:: about the girls---girl%1:18:04:: for family---family%1:14:02:: entertainments---entertainment%1:04:00:: , like `` Oh , What Fun !
A comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: in Three Acts---act%1:10:00:: '' , in which , under `` Personages---personage%1:18:00:: '' , Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: appeared as `` A Schoolmarm---schoolmarm%1:18:00:: '' , and Bertha---person%1:03:00:: , who was only a trifle less brilliant in high school---high_school%1:14:00:: than Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: had been , appeared as `` Dummkopf---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Sadie---person%1:03:00:: studied piano---piano%1:06:00:: ; played Chopin---chopin%1:10:00:: in the `` Soiree Musicale---soiree_musicale%1:14:00:: of Mr. Guthrie---person%1:03:00:: 's Pupils---pupil%1:18:00:: '' ; and she recited `` Hector 's Farewell to Andromache '' most movingly , to the special delight---delight%1:12:00:: of Rabbi Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: at his home---home%1:06:00:: in Germantown---location%1:03:00:: near Philadelphia---philadelphia%1:15:00:: , where the Szold---person%1:03:00:: girls---girl%1:18:04:: took turns visiting between the visits---visit%1:04:02:: of the Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: boys---boy%1:18:03:: at the Szolds---person%1:03:00:: ' in Baltimore---baltimore%1:15:00:: .
Adele---person%1:03:00:: , like Amy---person%1:03:00:: , the youngest of the Marches---person%1:03:00:: , was the rebellious , mischievous , rather calculating and ambitious one .
For Rachel---person%1:03:00:: , conceded to be the prettiest of the Szold---person%1:03:00:: girls---girl%1:18:04:: - and she did make a pretty picture---picture%1:06:00:: sitting in the grape-arbor---grape_arbor%1:06:00:: strumming her guitar---guitar%1:06:00:: and singing in her silvery tones---tone%1:07:01:: - there was no particular March---person%1:03:00:: counterpart---counterpart%1:09:00:: ; but both groups---group%1:03:00:: were so closely knit that despite individual differences---difference%1:07:00:: the family---family%1:14:00:: life---life%1:26:01:: in both cases---case%1:11:00:: was remarkably similar in atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: if not entirely in content---content%1:14:00:: - the one being definitely Jewish and the other vaguely Christian .
The Szolds---person%1:03:00:: , like the Marches---person%1:03:00:: , enjoyed and loved living together , even in troubled times---times%1:28:01:: ; and , as in the March---person%1:03:00:: home---home%1:15:04:: , any young man---young_man%1:18:00:: who called on the Szolds---person%1:03:00:: found himself confronted with a phalanx---phalanx%1:14:01:: of femininity---femininity%1:07:00:: which made it rather difficult to direct his particular attention---attention%1:09:00:: to any one of them .
This included Mamma---mamma%1:18:00:: , jolly , generous , and pretty , with whom they all fell in love , just as Papa---papa%1:18:00:: had first fallen in love with her Mamma before he chose her ; and when a young man---young_man%1:18:00:: like Morris Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: had enjoyed the Szold---person%1:03:00:: hospitality---hospitality%1:10:00:: , he felt obliged to send his respects---respects%1:10:00:: and his gifts---gift%1:21:00:: not merely to Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: , in whom he was really interested , but to all the Szold---person%1:03:00:: girls---girl%1:18:04:: and Mamma---mamma%1:18:00:: .
And just as `` Laurie---person%1:03:00:: '' Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: was first attracted to bright Jo March---person%1:03:00:: , who found him immature by her high standards---standard%1:10:00:: , and then had to content himself with her younger sister---sister%1:18:00:: Amy---person%1:03:00:: , so Joe Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: , who had also been writing Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: before he came to Johns Hopkins---group%1:03:00:: , had to content himself with her younger sister---sister%1:18:00:: , pretty Rachel---person%1:03:00:: .
And like Jo March---person%1:03:00:: , who saw her sisters---sister%1:18:00:: Meg---person%1:03:00:: and Amy---person%1:03:00:: involved in `` lovering '' before herself , Henrietta---person%1:03:00:: saw her sisters---sister%1:18:00:: Rachel---person%1:03:00:: and Sadie---person%1:03:00:: drawn outside their family---family%1:14:00:: circle---circle%1:14:00:: by the attraction---attraction%1:07:00:: of suitors---suitor%1:18:00:: , Rachel---person%1:03:00:: by Joe Jastrow---person%1:03:00:: , and Sadie---person%1:03:00:: by Max Lobl---person%1:03:00:: , a young businessman---businessman%1:18:00:: who would write her romantic descriptions---description%1:10:01:: of his trips---trip%1:04:00:: by steamboat---steamboat%1:06:00:: down the Mississippi---mississippi%1:17:00:: .
A man---man%1:18:00:: with a sketch pad---sketch_pad%1:06:00:: in hand---hand%1:08:00:: sat with a large pink woman---woman%1:18:00:: in a small office---office%1:06:00:: at the end---end%1:15:00:: of a long , dim corridor---corridor%1:06:00:: and made pencil---pencil%1:06:00:: lines---line%1:10:01:: on paper and said , `` Is this more like it , Mrs. MacReady---person%1:03:00:: ?
Or are the eyebrows---eyebrow%1:08:00:: more like this '' ?
When he had finished with that , he would go to another part---part%1:06:00:: of the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: and say much the same things---thing%1:10:00:: to someone else , most probably a busboy---busboy%1:18:00:: .
Different about the mouth---mouth%1:08:00:: , huh ?
Men---man%1:18:00:: blew dust---dust%1:27:00:: on objects---object%1:03:00:: in a room---room%1:06:00:: on the seventeenth floor---floor%1:06:01:: of the Hotel Dumont---location%1:03:00:: and blew it off again , and did the same in a tiny , almost airless room---room%1:06:00:: in a tenement---tenement%1:06:00:: in the West Forties---location%1:03:00:: .
And men---man%1:18:00:: also used vacuum cleaners---vacuum_cleaner%1:06:00:: in both rooms---room%1:06:00:: , sucking dust---dust%1:27:00:: up once more .
Men---man%1:18:00:: from the Third Detective District , Eighteenth Precinct---location%1:03:00:: , had the longest , the most tedious , job---job%1:04:01:: .
At the Hotel Dumont---location%1:03:00:: there had , at the time---time%1:28:00:: in issue , been twenty-three overnighters---overnighter%1:18:00:: , counting couples---couple%1:14:00:: as singular .
These included , as one , Mr.---person%1:03:00:: and Mrs. Anthony Payne---person%1:03:00:: , who had checked in a little---little%1:23:00:: after noon---noon%1:28:00:: the day---day%1:28:00:: before , and had not checked out together .
But Gardner Willings---person%1:03:00:: was not included ; he had been at the Dumont---location%1:03:00:: for almost a week---week%1:28:00:: .
There was , of course , no special reason---reason%1:16:00:: to believe that the man---man%1:18:00:: or woman---woman%1:18:00:: they sought had stayed only overnight at the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: .
The twenty-three---twenty-three%1:23:00:: ( or twenty-two---twenty-two%1:23:00:: with the Paynes---person%1:03:00:: themselves omitted ) provided merely a place---place%1:09:00:: to start , and their identification---identification%1:04:00:: was the barest of starts---start%1:11:00:: .
With names---name%1:10:00:: and addresses---address%1:15:00:: listed , verification---verification%1:09:00:: came next .
It would take time---time%1:28:05:: ; it would , almost inevitably , trouble some water .
( `` I certainly was not at the Dumont---location%1:03:00:: last night---night%1:28:00:: and my husband---husband%1:18:00:: could n't have been .
He 's in Boston---boston%1:15:00:: .
The Hotel King Arthur---location%1:03:00:: across the street---street%1:06:00:: provided almost twice as many problems---problem%1:26:00:: .
The King Arthur---location%1:03:00:: offered respectable and convenient lodgings---lodgings%1:06:00:: to people---people%1:14:00:: from the suburbs---suburb%1:15:00:: who wanted to see a show---show%1:04:00:: and did n't want - heaven knew did n't want !
- to lunge anxiously through crowded streets---street%1:06:00:: to railroad stations---railroad_station%1:06:00:: and , at odd hours---hours%1:28:01:: of night---night%1:28:00:: , drive from smaller stations---railroad_station%1:06:00:: to distant homes---home%1:06:00:: , probably through rain---rain%1:19:00:: or , in November---november%1:28:00:: , something worse .
The King Arthur---location%1:03:00:: was less expensive than the Dumont---location%1:03:00:: .
The King Arthur---location%1:03:00:: had fifty-four overnighters---overnighter%1:18:00:: , again counting rooms---room%1:06:00:: rather than people---people%1:14:00:: .
Check the overnighters---overnighter%1:18:00:: out .
Failing to find what was wanted , as was most likely , check out other guests---guest%1:18:00:: , with special - but not exclusive - attention---attention%1:09:00:: to those with rooms---room%1:06:00:: on the street---street%1:06:00:: .
( Anyone active enough can reach a roof---roof%1:06:00:: , wherever his room---room%1:06:00:: may be . )
And know , while all this went on , that there was no real reason---reason%1:16:00:: to suppose that the murderer---murderer%1:18:00:: had been a guest---guest%1:18:00:: in either hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: .
It was not even certain the shot---shot%1:06:00:: had been fired from either hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: .
There were other roofs---roof%1:06:00:: , less convenient but not impossible .
It is dull business---business%1:04:00:: , detecting---detecting%1:04:00:: , and hard on feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
There was also the one salient question---question%1:10:00:: to ask , and ask widely : Did you notice anything out of the way ?
Like , for example , a man---man%1:18:00:: carrying a twenty-two rifle---twenty-two_rifle%1:06:00:: , probably with a telescopic sight---telescopic_sight%1:06:00:: attached ?
There was , of course , no hope---hope%1:09:00:: it really would be that simple .
The sniper---sniper%1:18:00:: , whether psychopathic marksman---marksman%1:18:00:: or murderer---murderer%1:18:00:: by intent---intent%1:09:00:: , would hardly have walked to his vantage point---vantage_point%1:15:00:: with rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: over shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: , whistling a marching tune---tune%1:10:00:: .
Anybody carrying anything that might hide a rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: ?
Long thin suitcase---suitcase%1:06:00:: ?
Or long fat suitcase---suitcase%1:06:00:: , for that matter ?
Shrugs---shrug%1:10:00:: met that , from room clerks---room_clerk%1:18:00:: , from bellhops---bellhop%1:18:00:: .
But nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: , it appeared , long enough to attract attention---attention%1:09:00:: .
Cases---case%1:06:00:: , say , for musical instruments---musical_instrument%1:06:00:: ?
None noted at the Dumont---location%1:03:00:: .
Several at the King Arthur---location%1:03:00:: .
A combo---combo%1:14:00:: was staying there .
And had been for a week---week%1:28:00:: .
Shrugs---shrug%1:10:00:: met that .
( Detective Pearson---person%1:03:00:: , Eighteenth Precinct---location%1:03:00:: , thought for a time---time%1:28:00:: he might be on to something .
A refuse---refuse%1:27:00:: bin---bin%1:06:00:: at the Dumont---location%1:03:00:: turned up a florist---florist%1:06:00:: 's box---box%1:06:00:: - a very long box---box%1:06:00:: for very long stemmed flowers---flower%1:20:00:: .
Traces---trace%1:23:00:: of oil---oil%1:27:00:: on green tissue---tissue%1:27:02:: ?
The lab---lab%1:06:00:: to check .
The lab---lab%1:06:00:: : Sorry .
No oil---oil%1:27:00:: . )
Well , a man---man%1:18:00:: had tried , at the King Arthur---location%1:03:00:: , to register with an ocelot---ocelot%1:05:00:: .
At the Dumont---location%1:03:00:: , a guest---guest%1:18:00:: had come in a collapsible wheel chair---wheelchair%1:06:00:: .
At the King Arthur---location%1:03:00:: one guest---guest%1:18:00:: had had his head---head%1:08:00:: heavily bandaged , and another had a bandaged foot---foot%1:08:01:: and had walked with crutches---crutch%1:06:00:: .
There had also been a man---man%1:18:00:: who must have had St. Vitus or something , because he kept jerking his head---head%1:08:00:: .
As reports---report%1:10:01:: dribbled in , William Weigand---person%1:03:00:: tossed them into the centrifuge---centrifuge%1:06:00:: which had become his head---head%1:09:00:: .
Mullins---person%1:03:00:: came in .
There was no sign---sign%1:10:05:: of Mrs. Lauren Payne---person%1:03:00:: at her house---house%1:06:00:: on Nod Road---location%1:03:00:: , Ridgefield---location%1:03:00:: , Connecticut---connecticut%1:15:00:: .
The house---house%1:06:00:: was modern , large , on five acres---acre%1:23:00:: .
Must have cost plenty---plenty%1:23:00:: .
The State cops---cop%1:18:00:: would check from time to time ; pass word---word%1:10:02:: when there was word---word%1:10:02:: to pass .
Weigand---person%1:03:00:: tossed this news---news%1:10:00:: into the centrifuge---centrifuge%1:06:00:: .
Sort things---thing%1:09:02:: out , damn it .
Sort out the next move---move%1:04:00:: .
Try to forget motive---motive%1:03:00:: for the moment .
Consider opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: .
Only those actually with Payne---person%1:03:00:: when he was shot , or who had left the party---party%1:11:00:: within not more than five minutes---minute%1:28:00:: ( make five---five%1:23:00:: arbitrary ) positively had none .
The Norths---person%1:03:00:: ; Hathaway---person%1:03:00:: , Jerry---person%1:03:00:: 's publicity---publicity%1:10:00:: director---director%1:18:00:: ; Livingston Birdwood---person%1:03:00:: , producer---producer%1:18:02:: of Uprising .
They had been with Payne---person%1:03:00:: when he was shot , could not therefore have shot him from above .
Take Gardner Willings---person%1:03:00:: .
He had left after the scuffle---scuffle%1:04:00:: ; had been seen to leave .
He would have had ample time---time%1:28:05:: to go into a blind---blind%1:06:01:: somewhere and wait his prey---prey%1:18:00:: .
Intangibles---intangible%1:21:00:: entered , then - hunches---hunch%1:09:00:: which felt like facts---fact%1:09:01:: .
Willings---person%1:03:00:: would ambush , certainly ; Willings---person%1:03:00:: undoubtedly had .
Willings---person%1:03:00:: was , presumably , a better than average shot---shot%1:18:00:: .
But - hunch---hunch%1:09:00:: , now - Willings---person%1:03:00:: would not ambush anything which went on two legs---leg%1:08:02:: instead of four .
Because , if for no other reason---reason%1:16:00:: , Willings---person%1:03:00:: would never for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: suppose he was not bigger , tougher , than anything else that went on two legs---leg%1:08:02:: .
Ambushes---ambush%1:04:00:: are laid by those who doubt themselves , as any man---man%1:18:00:: may against a tiger---tiger%1:05:00:: .
Faith Constable---person%1:03:00:: had had to `` go on '' from the party---party%1:14:00:: and had , presumably , gone on .
Forget motive---motive%1:03:00:: ?
No , motive---motive%1:03:00:: is a part---part%1:24:00:: of fact---fact%1:26:01:: .
Nobody in his right mind punishes a quarter-century---quarter-century%1:28:00:: old dereliction---dereliction%1:04:00:: .
Grudges---grudge%1:12:00:: simply do not keep that well in a sane mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
Faith Constable---person%1:03:00:: had accomplished much---much%1:23:00:: in a quarter---quarter-century%1:28:00:: of a century .
Jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong---wrong%1:04:00:: ?
Bill---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
Also , he thought , I doubt if she could hit the side---side%1:06:00:: of a barn---barn%1:06:00:: with a shotgun---shotgun%1:06:00:: .
Lauren---person%1:03:00:: herself ?
She had left the party---party%1:11:00:: early , pleading a headache---headache%1:26:00:: .
No lack---lack%1:26:00:: of opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: , presuming she had a gun---gun%1:06:00:: .
She might , conceivably , have brought one in in a large enough suitcase---suitcase%1:06:00:: .
( Check on the Payne---person%1:03:00:: luggage---luggage%1:06:00:: . )
Motive---motive%1:03:00:: - her husband---husband%1:18:00:: wandering ?
Bitter , unreasoning jealousy---jealousy%1:12:00:: ?
There was nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to indicate that Lauren Payne---person%1:03:00:: was primitive .
She did not move in primitive circles---circle%1:14:00:: .
It occurred to Bill Weigand---person%1:03:00:: that he was , on a hunch---hunch%1:09:00:: basis---basis%1:09:00:: , eliminating a good many .
He reminded himself that all eliminations---elimination%1:04:02:: were tentative .
He also reminded himself that he had an unusual number---number%1:07:00:: of possibilities---possibility%1:09:00:: .
The Masons---person%1:03:00:: , mother---mother%1:18:00:: or son---son%1:18:00:: , or mother---mother%1:18:00:: and son---son%1:18:00:: ?
Opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: was obvious .
Motive---motive%1:03:00:: .
Here , too , the cause---cause%1:11:00:: to hate lay well back in the years---year%1:28:01:: .
But bitterness---bitterness%1:12:00:: had more cause---cause%1:10:00:: to remain , even increasingly to corrode .
With the boy---boy%1:18:03:: , particularly .
The boy---boy%1:18:03:: had , apparently - if Mrs. MacReady---person%1:03:00:: was right in what she had told Mullins---person%1:03:00:: - only in recent months---month%1:28:01:: been forced to give up college---college%1:14:00:: , to work as a busboy---busboy%1:18:00:: .
Seeing the man---man%1:18:00:: he blamed for this made much of - youth---youth%1:07:00:: and bitterness---bitterness%1:12:00:: and -
Bill---person%1:03:00:: picked up the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: ; got Mullins---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Send out a pickup---pickup%1:10:00:: on Mrs. Mason---person%1:03:00:: and the boy---boy%1:18:03:: when you 've got enough---enough%1:23:00:: to go on '' , Bill---person%1:03:00:: said .
Mullins---person%1:03:00:: would do .
A man---man%1:18:00:: named Lars Simon---person%1:03:00:: , playwright---playwright%1:18:00:: director---director%1:18:02:: , had expressed a wish---wish%1:10:00:: that Anthony Payne---person%1:03:00:: drop dead .
He would say , of course , that he had not really had any such wish---wish%1:12:00:: ; that what he had said was no more than one of those things---thing%1:10:00:: one does say , lightly , meaning nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
Which probably would turn out to be true ; which he obviously had to be given the opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to say .
A man---man%1:18:00:: named Blaine Smythe---person%1:03:00:: , with `` y '' and `` e '' but pronounced without them , had been fired at Payne---person%1:03:00:: 's insistence---insistence%1:10:00:: .
He was also , if Pam North---person%1:03:00:: was right , a closer acquaintance---acquaintance%1:18:00:: of Lauren Payne---person%1:03:00:: 's than she , now , was inclined to admit .
He might deny the latter ; would certainly deny any connection between the two things---thing%1:09:02:: , or any connection of either with murder .
He might deny the latter ; would certainly deny any connection---connection%1:24:00:: between the two---two%1:23:00:: things---thing%1:26:00:: , or any connection---connection%1:24:00:: of either with murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
He would have to be given the opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: .
Mullins---person%1:03:00:: ?
It was evident that Mullins---person%1:03:00:: was the man---man%1:18:00:: to go .
It was evident that a captain---captain%1:18:04:: should remain at his desk---desk%1:06:00:: , directing with a firm hand---hand%1:09:00:: and keeping a firm seat .
Bill Weigand---person%1:03:00:: was good and tired of the wall---wall%1:06:00:: opposite , and the crack---crack%1:17:00:: in the plaster---plaster%1:27:00:: .
Let Mullins---person%1:03:00:: keep the firm seat ; let Stein---person%1:03:00:: .
When Siamese cats---siamese_cat%1:05:00:: are intertwined it is difficult to tell where one leaves off and another begins .
Stilts and Shadow , on Pam---person%1:03:00:: 's bed---bed%1:06:00:: , appeared to be one cat---cat%1:05:00:: - rather large , as Siamese cats---siamese_cat%1:05:00:: go , and , to be sure , having two heads---head%1:08:00:: and two tails---tail%1:05:00:: .
On the other hand , they , or it , seemed to have no legs---leg%1:08:02:: whatever .
Pamela North---person%1:03:00:: said , `` Hi '' , to her cats---cat%1:05:00:: , and added that proper cats---cat%1:05:00:: met their humans at the door---door%1:06:01:: .
Of four dark brown ears---ear%1:08:01:: , one twitched slightly at this .
`` All right '' , Pam---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` I know it is n't dinnertime---dinnertime%1:28:00:: '' .
But at this the one too-large cat---cat%1:05:00:: suddenly became two cats---cat%1:05:00:: , stretching .
Shadow , the more talkative , began at once to talk , her voice---voice%1:07:00:: piteous .
Stilts , a more direct cat---cat%1:05:00:: , leaped from the bed---bed%1:06:00:: and trotted briskly toward the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: .
The hell it is n't dinnertime---dinnertime%1:28:00:: , two waving tails---tail%1:05:00:: told Pam North---person%1:03:00:: .
It was not , whatever tale---tale%1:10:00:: was told by tails---tail%1:05:00:: .
Martha---person%1:03:00:: presumably would cope .
They want to be fat cats---cat%1:05:00:: , Pam---person%1:03:00:: thought , and lighted a cigarette---cigarette%1:06:00:: and leaned back on a chaise---chaise%1:06:01:: and considered pulling her thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: together .
After a time---time%1:28:00:: , it occurred to her that her thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: were not worth the trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: .
A vague feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: that Anthony Payne---person%1:03:00:: had had it coming was hardly a thought---thought%1:09:01:: and was , in any event , reprehensible .
Had Faith Constable---person%1:03:00:: 's explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: of her confidence---confidence%1:12:00:: , so uninvited , been a little thin ?
That was more like a thought---thought%1:09:01:: , but not a great deal---great_deal%1:23:00:: more .
Had that tall dark boy---boy%1:18:00:: , carrying trays---tray%1:06:00:: too heavy for him , found what he might have considered adulation of a man---man%1:18:00:: he probably hated more than he could bear ?
- of a rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: and killed ?
Pam---person%1:03:00:: found she had no answers---answer%1:10:02:: ; had only a hope---hope%1:09:00:: .
The poor kid---kid%1:18:00:: - the poor , frail kid---kid%1:18:00:: .
Some people---people%1:14:00:: have luck---luck%1:19:00:: and some have no luck---luck%1:19:00:: and that , whatever people---people%1:14:00:: who prefer order---order%1:26:00:: say , is the size of it---size_of_it%1:26:00:: .
The telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: rang .
Pam---person%1:03:00:: realized , to her surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: , that she had been almost dozing .
At four---four%1:23:00:: o ' clock in the afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: .
Two martinis---martini%1:13:00:: for lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: - that was the trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: .
The voice---voice%1:07:00:: had music---music%1:09:00:: in it .
Even with words---word%1:10:00:: coming too fast , they came on the music---music%1:09:00:: of the voice---voice%1:07:00:: .
`` I said I would '' , Pam---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` They won n't talk about who gave the information---information%1:10:02:: .
`` They won n't talk about who gave the information---information%1:10:00:: .
They do n't , Mrs. Constable---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Call this a cry---cry%1:10:04:: for help---help%1:04:00:: '' , Faith Constable---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Well '' - said Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: .
`` I take a little time---time%1:28:05:: to think it over '' .
There would be all the nuisance---nuisance%1:09:00:: of contacting someone---someone%1:03:00:: else to take over .
Someone---someone%1:03:00:: reasonably trustworthy .
And Angie---person%1:03:00:: would hear about it .
And Angie---person%1:03:00:: knew -
`` Time---time%1:28:05:: '' , said Angie---person%1:03:00:: , and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Not too much time---time%1:28:05:: , because I 'll be needing some more myself pretty much right away .
And I done favors---favor%1:04:00:: for you , big favor---favor%1:04:00:: not so long back , did n't I , and I 'm right here to take on where Pretty---person%1:03:00:: left off .
No trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: .
I do n't want no trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: , you do n't want no trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: , nobody wants trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: , Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Dear heaven , no , thought Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: , turning away as another man---man%1:18:00:: came in .
He straightened his tie---tie%1:06:01:: at the mirror---mirror%1:06:00:: with a shaking hand---hand%1:08:00:: ; the genial smile---smile%1:10:00:: seemed painted on his face---face%1:08:00:: .
Angie---person%1:03:00:: knew - Speak of dangerous information---information%1:10:00:: !
Angie---person%1:03:00:: knew too much entirely already .
Really he had Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: at bay .
`` Big favor---favor%1:04:00:: I done you .
Acourse there 's this deal---deal%1:04:02:: o ' Denny---person%1:03:00:: 's - and Jackie---person%1:03:00:: 's - kinda hangin ' fire , ai n't it , maybe you 've been kinda worryin ' over that .
And can n't say I blame you '' , said Angie---person%1:03:00:: thoughtfully .
`` This deal---deal%1:04:02:: with the ace---ace%1:06:00:: o ' spades---spade%1:06:01:: .
Anything to do with an ace o ' spades , bad luck---bad_luck%1:11:00:: '' .
Anything to do with an ace---ace%1:06:00:: o ' spades---spade%1:06:01:: , bad luck---bad_luck%1:26:00:: '' .
Ace of spades - a widow---widow%1:18:00:: , that was what they called a widow---widow%1:18:00:: , these low-class crooks---crook%1:18:00:: remembered Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: distractedly .
All about that Angie---person%1:03:00:: knew , too .
When things---thing%1:26:00:: got a little out of hand , they very rapidly got a lot out of hand - it seemed to be a general rule---rule%1:09:03:: .
When things---thing%1:09:02:: got a little out of hand , they very rapidly got a lot out of hand - it seemed to be a general rule .
All just by chance , and in a way tracing back to poor Frank---person%1:03:00:: , all of it , because naturally - brothers---brother%1:18:00:: , living together - and Angie---person%1:03:00:: -
Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: did not at all like the look---look%1:07:01:: on Angelo---person%1:03:00:: 's regular featured , almost girlishly good-looking face---face%1:08:00:: - or indeed anything about Angelo---person%1:03:00:: .
Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: was not a man---man%1:18:04:: who thought very much about moral principles---moral_principle%1:09:00:: ; he found money---money%1:21:00:: much more interesting ; but all the same he thought now , uneasily , of the way---way%1:07:01:: in which Angelo---person%1:03:00:: earned his living---living%1:21:00:: - and paid for his own stuff---stuff%1:21:00:: - and eyed the soft smile---smile%1:10:00:: , and the spaniel---spaniel%1:05:00:: like dark eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , and he felt a little ill .
`` Look , my friend---friend%1:18:00:: '' , he said , `` in my life---life%1:26:02:: I learn , how is it the proverb---proverb%1:10:00:: says , better an ounce---ounce%1:23:02:: of prevention---prevention%1:04:00:: to a pound---pound%1:23:09:: of cure---cure%1:06:00:: .
I stay in business---business%1:04:00:: so long because I 'm careful .
Two weeks---two_weeks%1:28:00:: , a month---month%1:28:00:: , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops---cop%1:18:00:: know this and that , then we make a little deal---deal%1:04:02:: , is n't it '' ?
`` That 's a long while---while%1:28:00:: '' , said Angie---person%1:03:00:: .
`` I tell you , you want to leave it that way---way%1:26:00:: , I do n't fool around with it .
I go over to Castro---person%1:03:00:: and get fixed up there .
I can n't wait no two weeks---two_weeks%1:28:00:: '' .
And Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: did n't like Angie---person%1:03:00:: , but what with Prettyman---person%1:03:00:: and three of his boys---boy%1:18:02:: inside , and not likely to come out - And Angie---person%1:03:00:: such a valuable salesman---salesman%1:18:00:: , Prettyman---person%1:03:00:: said - All the nuisance---nuisance%1:09:00:: and danger---danger%1:26:00:: of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch---bunch%1:14:01:: of boys---boy%1:18:02:: - Why did everything have to happen at once ?
Denny---person%1:03:00:: said stupidly , `` Why , you ai n't turning Angie---person%1:03:00:: down , are you , Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: ?
I mean , we all figured - I guess anybody 'd figure - Angie---person%1:03:00:: '' -
Angelo---person%1:03:00:: gave him an affectionate smile---smile%1:10:00:: .
`` Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: too smart a fellow---fellow%1:18:00:: want to get rid of me '' , he said .
`` It 's O. K. , Denny---person%1:03:00:: , everything 's O. K. Ai n't it , Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Oh , God---god%1:18:00:: , the name---name%1:10:00:: repeated over and over , anybody to hear - Not being a fool---fool%1:18:00:: , Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: knew why .
But aside from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings---dealings%1:04:02:: with one who was nominally an underling---underling%1:18:00:: and actually held - you could say - the whip hand---whip_hand%1:07:00:: .
And all because of Domokous---person%1:03:00:: !
If Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: had dreamed of all the trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: that young man---person%1:03:00:: would eventually cause -
Of course , there was another factor---factor%1:11:00:: .
Angie---person%1:03:00:: worth his weight---weight%1:07:00:: in gold---gold%1:21:00:: right now , but these users---user%1:18:01:: , they sometimes went down fast .
Angie worth his weight in gold---gold%1:27:00:: right now , but these users , they sometimes went down fast .
Who knew , Angie---person%1:03:00:: might not last long .
The sweat---sweat%1:08:00:: broke out on Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: ' forehead---forehead%1:08:00:: as he realized he had been actually thinking - hoping - planning - perhaps -
Good God above , had not Domokous---person%1:03:00:: been enough ?
He patted Angelo---person%1:03:00:: 's thin shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: paternally .
`` Now you do n't want to go talking that way---way%1:07:01:: '' , he said .
`` Sure , sure , you 're the one take over for Pretty---person%1:03:00:: , soon as I get the supply---supply%1:23:00:: , get started up again , is n't it ?
You do n't need worry , Angelo---person%1:03:00:: .
I tell you , I know how it is with you , my friend---friend%1:18:00:: , I sympathize , and I 'll make it a special point---point%1:09:02:: - a special favor---favor%1:04:00:: - get in touch , and get some stuff---stuff%1:06:00:: just for you .
I do n't know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:01:: , but I 'll try my best , my friend---friend%1:18:00:: .
You see , you got to remember , we all got schedules---schedule%1:10:00:: , like any business---business%1:14:00:: !
My man---man%1:18:08:: , he won n't be around a little while---while%1:28:00:: , he just fixed me up with this stuff---stuff%1:06:00:: they took out of the Elite---group%1:03:00:: .
`` Well , that 's your business---business%1:09:01:: , Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: '' , said Angie---person%1:03:00:: , and his dreamy eyes---eye%1:08:00:: moved past Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: ' shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: to gaze vaguely out the ground glass---ground_glass%1:27:00:: window---window%1:06:00:: .
We do n't none of us want no trouble---trouble%1:04:02:: .
I 'm in a room---room%1:06:00:: over the Golden Club---group%1:03:00:: on San Pedro---location%1:03:00:: , you just ask for me there , you want see me .
About nine o ' clock---clock%1:06:00:: , I call and see if you got any .
A couple---couple%1:23:01:: decks---deck%1:06:01:: for me , Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: - and ten twelve to sell , see , I like to have a little ready cash---cash%1:21:00:: '' .
`` Oh , now , I do n't know about that much '' , said Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: .
`` And you know , Angelo---person%1:03:00:: , Pretty---person%1:03:00:: , he always keeps it a strict cash basis---cash_basis%1:21:00:: , like they say '' -
`` Sure '' , said Angie---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Sure , Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: .
Fifty a throw---throw%1:26:00:: , that the deal---deal%1:04:02:: ?
I bring you the cash---cash%1:21:00:: , say five hundred for ten decks---deck%1:06:01:: .
Never mind how much I cut it , how much I get '' , and he smiled his sleepy smile---smile%1:10:00:: again .
`` Standard deal---deal%1:04:02:: , Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: .
`` I do my best '' , said Mr. Skyros---person%1:03:00:: earnestly , `` just for you , my friend---friend%1:18:00:: .
This is awkward for everybody , is n't it , we all got to put up with inconvenience---inconvenience%1:07:01:: sometimes .
He got out of there in a hurry---hurry%1:07:00:: , brushing past another man---man%1:18:00:: in the door---door%1:06:00:: , mopping his brow---brow%1:08:00:: .
The expedient thing---thing%1:04:00:: - yes , very true , one must make do as one could , in some situations---situation%1:26:01:: .
Not very much later , but when things---thing%1:26:00:: had settled down a little .
After this deal---deal%1:04:02:: with the Bouvardier---person%1:03:00:: woman---woman%1:18:00:: went through .
An ace of spades---ace_of_spades%1:06:00:: .
He was not a superstitious man---man%1:18:00:: , but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that , indeed .
He rather wished he had never got into the business---business%1:04:01:: , and still - scarcely to be resisted , a nice little profit---profit%1:21:00:: with not much work---work%1:04:00:: involved , easy money---easy_money%1:21:00:: .
Katya Roslev---person%1:03:00:: , who would be Katharine Ross---person%1:03:00:: so very soon now , rang up her first sale---sale%1:04:00:: of the day---day%1:28:04:: and counted back the change---change%1:21:02:: .
She did not notice that the customer---customer%1:18:00:: seized her purchase---purchase%1:21:00:: and turned away without a smile---smile%1:10:00:: or a word---word%1:10:03:: of thanks---thanks%1:10:00:: .
Usually she marked the few who did thank you---thank_you%1:10:00:: , you did n't get that kind---kind%1:09:00:: much in a place---place%1:15:04:: like this : and she played a little game---game%1:04:01:: with herself , seeing how downright rude she could act to the others , before they 'd take offense---offense%1:12:00:: , threaten to call the manager---manager%1:18:00:: .
The kind---kind%1:09:00:: who came into a cheap store---store%1:06:00:: like this !
This kind---kind%1:09:00:: of place---place%1:15:04:: .
She 'd be through here , just no time---time%1:28:05:: at all - leave this kind---kind%1:09:00:: of thing---thing%1:09:02:: ' way behind .
Off at noon---noon%1:28:00:: , and she 'd never come back .
Money---money%1:21:00:: - a lot of money---money%1:21:00:: , enough .
She 'd be smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bills---bill%1:21:00:: so 's nobody would suspect - maybe could n't get it until Monday---monday%1:28:00:: account of that , the banks---bank%1:14:00:: - But that was n't really long to wait .
No need---need%1:17:00:: say anything at all to the old woman---old_woman%1:18:00:: .
She 'd say she did n't feel good on Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: , could n't go to church---church%1:04:00:: - there 'd be a little argument---argument%1:10:03:: , but she could be stubborn - and when the old woman---old_woman%1:18:00:: had gone , quick pack the things---things%1:21:00:: she 'd need to take , all but the dress---dress%1:06:00:: she 'd wear Monday---monday%1:28:00:: , and take the bag---bag%1:06:00:: down to that place---place%1:15:00:: in the station---station%1:06:00:: where you could put things---things%1:21:00:: in a locker---locker%1:06:00:: overnight , for a dime---dime%1:21:00:: .
Then on Monday---monday%1:28:00:: morning---morning%1:28:00:: - or it might have to be Tuesday---tuesday%1:28:00:: - get up and leave just the usual time---time%1:28:06:: , and last thing---thing%1:04:00:: , put the money---money%1:21:00:: in an envelope---envelope%1:06:01:: under the old woman---old_woman%1:18:00:: 's purse---purse%1:06:00:: there in the drawer---drawer%1:06:00:: .
She would n't be going to get that for an hour---hour%1:28:00:: or so after Katya---person%1:03:00:: had left , go do the daily shopping---shopping%1:04:00:: .
No need---need%1:17:00:: leave a note---note%1:10:03:: with it , either - or maybe just something like , Do n't worry about me , I 'm going away to make a better life---life%1:26:01:: .
A better life---life%1:26:01:: .
Escape---escape%1:04:00:: .
Escape---escape%1:04:02:: .
It was n't as if she wanted much---much%1:23:00:: .
She did n't mind working hard , not as if she figured to do anything wrong to live easy and soft - all she wanted was a chance---chance%1:26:00:: , where she was n't marked as what she was .
To be Katharine Ross , and work in a nicer shop somewhere , at a little more money so she could have prettier clothes , and learn ladies ' manners and all like that , and get to know different people than up to now , not just the ones like her here , with foreign sounding names , the ones went to the same church and - Different place , different job---job%1:04:00:: , different people , she 'd be all different too .

Prettier , she 'd do her hair---hair%1:08:00:: another way---way%1:07:01:: ; smarter , and wear different kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: - she 'd be Katharine Ross---person%1:03:00:: , just what that sounded like .
`` You 've give me the wrong change---change%1:21:02:: '' , said the customer---customer%1:18:00:: sharply .
Katya---person%1:03:00:: made up the amount---amount%1:21:00:: in indifferent silence---silence%1:07:01:: .
She was listening to other voices---voice%1:07:00:: , out of the future---future%1:28:00:: .
Some of those vaguely imagined new , different people---people%1:14:00:: .
Oh , Katharine---person%1:03:00:: 's awfully nice , and pretty too , I like Katharine---person%1:03:00:: .
Let 's ask Katharine to go with us , she 's always lots of fun---fun%1:10:00:: .
Let 's ask Katharine---person%1:03:00:: to go with us , she 's always lots of fun---fun%1:04:00:: .
Katharine---person%1:03:00:: .
Mendoza---person%1:03:00:: did n't wake until nearly nine thirty .
It was going to be another hot day---day%1:28:00:: ; already the thermometer---thermometer%1:06:00:: stood close to ninety .
It was going to be another hot day---day%1:28:04:: ; already the thermometer stood close to ninety .
Alison---person%1:03:00:: was still sound asleep ; he made fresh coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: and searched through all the desk---desk%1:06:00:: drawers---drawer%1:06:00:: for more cigarettes---cigarette%1:06:00:: before thinking of her handbag---handbag%1:06:00:: , and found a crumpled stray cigarette---cigarette%1:06:00:: at its bottom---bottom%1:15:01:: , which tasted peculiarly of face powder---face_powder%1:06:00:: .
He left a note---note%1:10:03:: propped on the desk---desk%1:06:00:: asking her to call him sometime today---today%1:28:01:: , and drove home .
After he 'd got out fresh liver---liver%1:13:00:: for Bast , he paused to look at her crouched daintily over her dish---dish%1:13:00:: .
Surely she was just a trifle fatter around the middle---middle%1:08:00:: ?
He seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians---person%1:03:00:: had large litters---litter%1:14:00:: , and suffered a dismaying vision---vision%1:09:03:: of the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: overrun with a dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: kittens---kitten%1:05:00:: .
He seemed to remember reading somewhere that Abyssinians had large litters , and suffered a dismaying vision---vision%1:09:02:: of the apartment overrun with a dozen kittens .
`` A lot of people are so peculiar that they do n't like cats , it 's not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes---home%1:06:00:: for kittens - and , damn it , you know very well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away !
`` A lot---lot%1:23:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: are so peculiar that they do n't like cats---cat%1:05:00:: , it 's not the easiest thing---thing%1:04:00:: in the world to find good homes---home%1:15:04:: for kittens---kitten%1:05:00:: - and , damn it , you know very well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away !
And I suppose now that you 've finally grown up , if a little late , you 'd go on producing kittens---kitten%1:05:00:: every six months---month%1:28:00:: or so .
Yes , well , it 's a pity---pity%1:11:00:: to spoil your girlish figure---figure%1:08:00:: - which all those kittens---kitten%1:05:00:: would do anyway - but I think when you 've raised these we 'll just have the vet---vet%1:18:00:: fix it so there won n't be any more .
I wonder if the Carters---person%1:03:00:: would take one .
And it 's no good---good%1:07:00:: looking at me like that '' , as she wound affectionately around his ankles---ankle%1:08:00:: .
`` I had a rather small place---place%1:15:06:: of my own .
A nice bachelor---bachelor%1:18:00:: apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: in a place---place%1:15:04:: called the Lancaster Arms---location%1:03:00:: '' .
`` Uhhu '' , she said , hardly listening as she studied her left eyelid---eyelid%1:08:00:: .
`` And then I had another place---place%1:15:04:: farther downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: I used as a studio---studio%1:06:00:: '' .
`` I 'm not a man---man%1:18:00:: who has many close intimate friends---friend%1:18:00:: , Carla---person%1:03:00:: '' , he said , wanting her to know all about him .
`` Oh , I 'd drink with newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: people---people%1:14:00:: .
I think I was what you might call a convivial man---man%1:18:00:: , and yet it was when I was alone in my studio---studio%1:06:00:: , doing my work---work%1:04:00:: , that I really felt alive .
But I think a man---man%1:18:00:: needs at least one intimate friend---friend%1:18:00:: to communicate with '' .
Pausing , he waited for her to turn , to ask a question---question%1:10:00:: .
She showed no interest---interest%1:09:00:: at all in the life---life%1:09:00:: he had led back home---home%1:15:02:: , and it hurt him a little .
`` Well , what about you , Carla---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` Did you make friends---friend%1:18:00:: easily '' ?
`` I guess so '' , she said taking a Kleenex---kleenex%1:27:00:: from her purse---purse%1:06:00:: .
When she had wiped some of the lipstick---lipstick%1:06:00:: from her mouth---mouth%1:08:00:: , she stared solemnly at her image---image%1:06:00:: in the mirror---mirror%1:06:00:: .
`` Are your people---people%1:14:02:: still alive '' ? he asked , trying to touch a part---part%1:24:00:: of her life---life%1:26:02:: Alberto---person%1:03:00:: had n't discussed ; so he could have something of her for himself .
`` You talk so well , Carla---person%1:03:00:: '' , he went on .
`` You seem to have read so much , you have a natural gift---gift%1:09:00:: for words---words%1:10:04:: '' , he added , trying to flatter her vanity---vanity%1:12:00:: .
`` You must have been good at history---history%1:09:00:: at school---school%1:14:00:: .
Where did you go to school---school%1:14:00:: '' ?
`` Do n't you know all about me by this time---time%1:28:06:: ?
My name---name%1:10:00:: 's Carla Caneli---person%1:03:00:: .
This is my town---town%1:15:00:: .
Would you be happier if I made up some stories---story%1:10:02:: about my life---life%1:28:01:: , told you some lies---lie%1:10:00:: ?
The cleansing---cleansing%1:04:00:: tissues---tissue%1:27:02:: she had been using had been falling on the floor---floor%1:06:00:: , and he got up and picked up one , then another , hoping she would notice what he was doing .
At home he had been a clean orderly man---man%1:18:00:: , and now he had to hide his annoyance---annoyance%1:26:00:: .
Was she just naturally sloppy about everything but her physical appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: ?
Would he have to clean up after her every day , clean the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: , the bathroom---bathroom%1:06:00:: , and get down on his knees---knee%1:08:00:: and scrub the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: floor---floor%1:06:00:: , then hang up her dresses---dress%1:06:00:: , pick up her stockings---stocking%1:06:00:: , make the bed---bed%1:06:00:: while she lay around ?
He straightened up , ready to vent his exasperation---exasperation%1:12:00:: , then grew afraid .
If he dwelt on the indignities---indignity%1:04:00:: he suffered he would lose all respect---respect%1:09:01:: for her , and without the respect---respect%1:09:01:: he might lose his view---view%1:09:02:: of her , too .
`` Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: at all '' , he said quietly .
`` Are those the only shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: you have , Sam---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` The heavy thick soles---sole%1:06:00:: .
`` They 're an expensive English shoe---shoe%1:06:00:: for walking around a lot .
`` Sam---person%1:03:00:: , no one around here wears such heavy soles---sole%1:06:00:: .
Ca n't you get another pair---pair%1:14:01:: '' ?
`` I 'll get an elegant pair---pair%1:14:01:: of thin soled Italian shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:01:: , Carla---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` And I do n't know why you want to go on wearing that outfit---outfit%1:06:01:: '' , she said , making a face---face%1:07:03:: .
He had put on the gray jacket---jacket%1:06:00:: and the dark gray slacks---slacks%1:06:00:: and the fawn---fawn%1:07:00:: colored shirt---shirt%1:06:00:: he had worn that first night---night%1:28:00:: in Rome---rome%1:15:00:: when he had encountered her on the street---street%1:06:00:: .
`` Oh , Sam---person%1:03:00:: .
You look like a tweedy Englishman---englishman%1:18:00:: .
`` I do n't mind at all '' , he said , delighted with her attention---attention%1:04:02:: .
Changing his clothes , he put on his dark-blue flannel---flannel%1:06:00:: suit---suit%1:06:00:: , and laid away the gray jacket---jacket%1:06:00:: with the feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: that he might be putting it aside for good .
But it was a hopeful sign---sign%1:10:03:: , he told himself .
She no longer wanted anything about him to remind her of the circumstances---circumstance%1:26:02:: of their meeting---meeting%1:11:00:: that first night---night%1:28:00:: in Parioli---location%1:03:00:: .
That day---day%1:28:00:: they loafed around , just getting the feel---feel%1:26:00:: of the city---city%1:15:00:: .
They looked at the ruins---ruin%1:06:00:: of the old Roman wall---wall%1:06:00:: on the lower Via Veneto---location%1:03:00:: , then they went to the Farnese Gardens---location%1:03:00:: .
She had some amusing scandal---scandal%1:10:00:: about the Farneses---person%1:03:00:: in the old days---day%1:28:03:: .
Then they took a taxi---taxi%1:06:00:: to Trastevere---location%1:03:00:: .
`` There 's a church---church%1:06:00:: you should see '' , she said .
And when they stood by the fountain---fountain%1:06:02:: in the piazza---piazza%1:15:00:: looking at Santa Maria he had to keep a straight face---straight_face%1:10:00:: , not letting on he had been there with Alberto---person%1:03:00:: .
He let her tell him all about the church---church%1:06:00:: .
Then they had dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: .
All evening---evening%1:28:00:: she was eloquent and pleased with herself .
When they got home at midnight---midnight%1:28:00:: she was tired out .
And in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: when he woke up at ten---ten%1:23:00:: the church bells---church_bell%1:06:00:: were ringing .
He had never heard so many bells---bell%1:06:00:: , and as he lay there listening , he thought of her scolding him for his remarks---remark%1:10:00:: when he had looked up at the obelisk---obelisk%1:06:00:: and the church---church%1:06:00:: at the top---top%1:15:01:: of the Spanish Steps---location%1:03:00:: .
It was a good thing---thing%1:26:00:: that she clung to her religion---religion%1:09:00:: , he thought .
`` Carla---person%1:03:00:: , wake up '' , he said shaking her .
`` It 's ten---ten%1:23:00:: o ' clock .
Are n't you going out to mass---mass%1:04:00:: ?
`` I think I 'll sleep in this morning---morning%1:28:00:: '' , she said drowsily , and as she snuggled against him , he wondered if she ever went to church---church%1:04:00:: .
Why did he want her to go to church---church%1:04:00:: ?
Probably because it was a place---place%1:15:00:: where she might get a feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: of certainty---certainty%1:09:00:: and security---security%1:12:00:: .
It was too bad he had no feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: himself for church---church%1:04:00:: .
Not his poor mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's fault---fault%1:04:00:: .
She would have been better off if she had stuck to her Bible---bible%1:10:00:: .
As for himself , he just did n't have the temperament---temperament%1:07:00:: for it .
From the time---time%1:28:05:: he had been at college---college%1:14:00:: he had achieved a certain tranquility---tranquility%1:07:00:: and composure---composure%1:07:00:: by accepting the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that there were certain things---thing%1:09:00:: he could never know .
Then he thought of those Old Testament---old_testament%1:10:00:: figures---figure%1:06:00:: on the ceiling---ceiling%1:06:00:: of the Sistine Chapel .
Just figures---figure%1:06:00:: out of a tribal folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: .
Could he honestly believe it would be good for Carla---person%1:03:00:: to have those old prophets---prophet%1:18:01:: gripping her imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: now ?
Being a woman---woman%1:18:00:: though , she would take only what she needed from church---church%1:04:00:: .
It was too bad he was n't a Catholic---catholic%1:18:00:: himself .
Or a Protestant---protestant%1:18:00:: , or one of those amusing dogmatic atheists---atheist%1:18:00:: , or a strict orthodox Communist---communist%1:18:01:: .
It was the times---times%1:28:01:: , he was sure .
All the ideologies---ideology%1:09:03:: changing from day---day%1:28:03:: to day---day%1:28:03:: , right under his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , so how could a man---man%1:18:00:: look to any one of them for an enlargement---enlargement%1:04:00:: of his freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: ?
Just the same , he thought , pondering over it , it would be a good thing---thing%1:26:00:: for a girl---girl%1:18:00:: like Carla---person%1:03:00:: if she got up and went to church---church%1:04:00:: .
A half hour---half-hour%1:28:00:: later he got her up to go out for breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: so the Ferraros---person%1:03:00:: , hearing them hurrying down the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: , would think they were going to a late mass---mass%1:04:00:: .
It seemed to him that if the Ferraros---person%1:03:00:: felt sure of them , could place them , it would help him to feel more sure of himself with Carla---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Since we 're having coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: with them this afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: '' , he said , `` I think I 'll ask the daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: if we can pay her to come in every day to clean for us '' .
And he waited for her to say , `` Oh , no , I can do it , Sam---person%1:03:00:: .
`` I 'm not good at that kind---kind%1:09:00:: of thing---thing%1:04:00:: '' .
`` This afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: let 's take an air with them .
Let 's be fine superior people---people%1:14:00:: of great dignity---dignity%1:07:00:: '' , he said as if he were joking .
`` If you find it necessary , Sam---person%1:03:00:: , go ahead '' , she said , turning on the stair---stair%1:06:00:: .
Her words---words%1:10:03:: remained with him , worrying him for hours---hours%1:28:01:: .
He did n't know how she would behave with other people---people%1:14:00:: .
When they walked into the Ferraro---person%1:03:00:: apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: , the old lady---lady%1:18:02:: , bowing and smiling , said softly .
`` Ciao , '' and put out her hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
Her little brown face---face%1:08:00:: wrinkled up , her brown eyes---eye%1:08:00:: gleamed , and with her little gestures---gesture%1:04:00:: she said all the courteous things---thing%1:10:00:: .
Agnese---person%1:03:00:: , smiling too , said , `` ' Ello '' , and then more slowly , `` I am happy '' .
And they sat down and began their little coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: party---party%1:14:00:: .
The Ferraros---person%1:03:00:: offered them biscuits---biscuit%1:13:02:: with the coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: .
Acting only as interpreter---interpreter%1:18:01:: Carla---person%1:03:00:: , her hands---hand%1:08:00:: folded on her lap---lap%1:08:00:: , was utterly impersonal .
Watching her , he felt like a spectator---spectator%1:18:00:: at a tennis---tennis%1:04:00:: game---game%1:04:00:: , with the ball---ball%1:06:01:: being bounced back and forth .
Signora Ferraro---person%1:03:00:: , bobbing her head---head%1:08:00:: encouragingly , asked Sam---person%1:03:00:: about Canada---canada%1:15:00:: , having a special interest---interest%1:09:00:: .
Carla---person%1:03:00:: translated .
The old woman had a nephew from North Italy , a poor boy from a lumber mill who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment , and who had migrated to Canada to work on the railway---railway%1:06:00:: .
The old woman---old_woman%1:18:00:: had a nephew---nephew%1:18:00:: from North Italy---location%1:03:00:: , a poor boy---boy%1:18:00:: from a lumber---lumber%1:27:00:: mill---mill%1:06:01:: who had got tired of the seasonal unemployment---unemployment%1:26:00:: , and who had migrated to Canada---canada%1:15:00:: to work on the railway---railway%1:06:01:: .
For a year---year%1:28:01:: the boy---boy%1:18:00:: had lived in the bush---bush%1:15:00:: in a boxcar---boxcar%1:06:00:: .
Did many of Sam---person%1:03:00:: 's countrymen---countryman%1:18:00:: live in boxcars---boxcar%1:06:00:: in the bush---bush%1:15:00:: ?
Had Sam---person%1:03:00:: ever lived in a boxcar---boxcar%1:06:00:: ?
Regretfully Sam---person%1:03:00:: explained that he had no experience---experience%1:09:01:: with boxcars---boxcar%1:06:00:: .
Just the same , the old woman---old_woman%1:18:00:: said , she would write to her nephew---nephew%1:18:00:: in his boxcar---boxcar%1:06:00:: and tell him she had met a nice man---man%1:18:00:: from his adopted country---country%1:15:00:: .
And Sam---person%1:03:00:: thanked her , and hoped he might meet her nephew---nephew%1:18:00:: back home---home%1:15:02:: , and asked her if she had any further news---news%1:10:00:: of the Pope---pope%1:18:00:: .
A very great Pope---pope%1:18:00:: , this one , the old woman---old_woman%1:18:00:: explained , her black eyes---eye%1:08:00:: sparkling .
An intellectual---intellectual%1:18:00:: .
It was said that he had had a vision---vision%1:11:00:: .
Just as thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: that day---day%1:28:01:: in Portugal---portugal%1:15:00:: had seen the sun---sun%1:17:00:: dancing in the sky---sky%1:17:00:: , he had seen the same thing---thing%1:11:00:: later in his own garden---garden%1:06:00:: , and she turned to Agnese---person%1:03:00:: for confirmation---confirmation%1:09:00:: .
Agnese---person%1:03:00:: had been sitting quietly , listening with the serenity---serenity%1:07:00:: of the unaware .
Now a little flush---flush%1:26:00:: came on her pale homely face---face%1:08:00:: and enchantment---enchantment%1:12:00:: in her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
The Holy Father---holy_father%1:18:00:: would die soon , she said to Carla---person%1:03:00:: , so she could translate for Sam---person%1:03:00:: , although he had a brilliant doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , a man---man%1:18:00:: who did not need the assistance---assistance%1:07:00:: of those doctors---doctor%1:18:00:: offered by the great rulers---ruler%1:18:00:: of the world .
Yes , the Pope---pope%1:18:00:: could die and quickly be made a saint---saint%1:18:03:: .
No , he was indeed a saint---saint%1:18:00:: now .
Nodding approvingly and swelling with importance---importance%1:26:00:: , the old lady---lady%1:18:02:: whispered confidentially .
There was a certain discontent---discontent%1:12:00:: among the cardinals---cardinal%1:18:00:: .
The Pope---pope%1:18:00:: , in the splendor---splendor%1:07:01:: of his great intellect---intellect%1:09:02:: , had neglected them a little .
There would be changes---change%1:04:00:: made , and Signor Raymond---person%1:03:00:: should understand that when the Pope---pope%1:18:00:: died it was like the end---end%1:11:00:: of a regime---regime%1:14:00:: in Rome---rome%1:14:00:: .
There would be changes---change%1:11:00:: made , and Signor Raymond should understand that when the Pope died it was like the end of a regime in Rome .
Jobs---job%1:04:00:: would be lost and new faces---face%1:18:00:: would become prominent .
Did Signor Raymond---person%1:03:00:: understand ?
Indeed he did , Sam---person%1:03:00:: said solemnly , trying to get Carla---person%1:03:00:: 's eye---eye%1:09:01:: .
Surely she could see that these women---woman%1:18:00:: were her Italians---italian%1:18:00:: , too , he thought .
Devout , orthodox and plain like a family---family%1:14:02:: she might meet in Brooklyn---brooklyn%1:15:00:: or Malta---location%1:03:00:: or Ireland---location%1:03:00:: .
But Carla---person%1:03:00:: ; eyes---eye%1:08:00:: were on Agnese---person%1:03:00:: whose glowing face---face%1:07:00:: and softening eyes---eye%1:08:00:: gave her a look---look%1:07:00:: of warmth---warmth%1:12:00:: and happiness---happiness%1:26:00:: .
And Carla---person%1:03:00:: , watching in wonder---wonder%1:12:00:: , turned to Sam---person%1:03:00:: .
`` It means so much---much%1:23:00:: to her .
It 's like a flame---flame%1:22:00:: , I guess '' , she said in a dreamy tone---tone%1:10:01:: .
It is obvious enough that linguists---linguist%1:18:01:: in general have been less successful in coping with tone systems---tone_system%1:10:00:: than with consonants---consonant%1:10:00:: or vowels---vowel%1:10:00:: .
No single explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: is adequate to account for this .
Improvement---improvement%1:11:00:: , however , is urgent , and at least three things---thing%1:06:01:: will be needed .
The first---first%1:24:00:: is a wide-ranging sample---sample%1:09:01:: of successful tonal analyses---analysis%1:04:00:: .
Even beginning students---student%1:18:00:: in linguistics---linguistics%1:09:00:: are made familiar with an appreciable variety---variety%1:14:01:: of consonant systems---consonant_system%1:10:00:: , both in their general outlines---outline%1:10:00:: and in many specific details---detail%1:24:00:: .
An advanced student---student%1:18:00:: has read a considerable number---number%1:07:00:: of descriptions---description%1:10:01:: of consonantal systems---consonantal_system%1:10:00:: , including some of the more unusual types---type%1:09:00:: .
By contrast---contrast%1:04:00:: , even experienced linguists---linguist%1:18:01:: commonly know no more of the range---range%1:07:00:: of possibilities---possibility%1:26:00:: in tone systems---tone_system%1:10:00:: than the over-simple distinction---distinction%1:09:00:: between register---register_language%1:10:00:: and contour languages---contour_language%1:10:00:: .
This limited familiarity with the possible phenomena has severely hampered work with tone---tone%1:07:01:: .
This limited familiarity---familiarity%1:09:00:: with the possible phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: has severely hampered work---work%1:04:00:: with tone---tone%1:07:02:: .
Tone---tone%1:07:02:: analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection---selection%1:14:00:: of systems---system%1:14:00:: is familar to every practicing field---field%1:15:01:: linguist---linguist%1:18:01:: .
Papers---papers%1:10:00:: like these four---four%1:23:00:: , if widely read , will contribute importantly to improvement---improvement%1:11:00:: of our analytic work---work%1:04:00:: .
The second need---need%1:17:00:: is better field---field%1:15:01:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: .
The great majority---majority%1:07:00:: of present-day linguists---linguist%1:18:01:: fall into one---one%1:23:00:: or more of a number---number%1:07:00:: of overlapping types---type%1:09:00:: : those who are convinced that tone---tone%1:07:02:: cannot be analysed , those who are personally scared of tone---tone%1:07:02:: and tone languages---tone_language%1:10:00:: generally , those who are convinced that tone---tone%1:07:02:: is merely an unnecessary marginal feature---feature%1:09:00:: in those languages---language%1:10:00:: where it occurs , those who have no idea---idea%1:09:00:: how to proceed with tone---tone%1:07:02:: analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: , those who take a simplistic view---view%1:09:02:: of the whole matter---matter%1:09:00:: .
The great majority of present-day linguists fall into one or more of a number of overlapping types : those who are convinced that tone---tone%1:07:01:: cannot be analysed , those who are personally scared of tone---tone%1:07:01:: and tone languages generally , those who are convinced that tone---tone%1:07:01:: is merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those languages where it occurs , those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis , those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter .
The result---result%1:19:00:: has been neglect---neglect%1:09:00:: , fumbling efforts---effort%1:04:00:: , or superficial treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: .
As these maladies---malady%1:26:01:: overlap , so must the cure---cure%1:06:00:: .
Analyses---analysis%1:04:00:: such as these four---four%1:23:00:: will simultaneously combat the assumptions---assumption%1:09:00:: that tone---tone%1:07:02:: is impossible and that it is simple .
Analyses such as these four will simultaneously combat the assumptions that tone---tone%1:07:01:: is impossible and that it is simple .
They will give suggestions---suggestion%1:09:00:: that can be worked up into field---field%1:15:01:: procedures---procedure%1:04:02:: .
Good field---field%1:15:01:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: will not only equip linguists---linguist%1:18:01:: for better work---work%1:04:00:: , but also help them overcome negative attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: .
Actually , none of these papers---papers%1:10:00:: says much---much%1:23:00:: directly about field---field%1:15:01:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: .
But it is worth pondering that very little---little%1:23:00:: has been published on any phase---phase%1:28:00:: of field---field%1:15:01:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: in linguistics---linguistics%1:09:00:: .
These things---thing%1:06:00:: have been disseminated by other means---means%1:06:00:: , but always in the wake---wake%1:19:00:: of extensive publication---publication%1:04:01:: of analytic results---result%1:19:00:: .
The third need---need%1:17:00:: is for better theory---theory%1:09:00:: .
We should expect that general phonologic theory should be as adequate for tone---tone%1:07:01:: as for consonants and vowels , but it has not been .
We should expect that general phonologic theory---theory%1:09:00:: should be as adequate for tone---tone%1:07:02:: as for consonants---consonant%1:10:00:: and vowels---vowel%1:10:00:: , but it has not been .
This can only be for one of two---two%1:23:00:: reasons---reason%1:16:00:: : either the two are quite different and will require totally different theory---theory%1:09:00:: ( and hence techniques---technique%1:09:00:: ) , or our existing theories---theory%1:09:00:: are insufficiently general .
If , as I suspect , the problem---problem%1:26:00:: is largely of the second sort---sort%1:09:00:: , then development---development%1:04:01:: of a theory---theory%1:09:00:: better able to handle tone---tone%1:07:02:: will result automatically in better theory---theory%1:09:00:: for all phonologic subsystems---subsystem%1:14:00:: .
If , as I suspect , the problem is largely of the second sort , then development of a theory better able to handle tone---tone%1:07:01:: will result automatically in better theory for all phonologic subsystems .
One issue---issue%1:09:01:: that must be faced is the relative difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: of analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of different phonologic subsystems---subsystem%1:14:00:: .
Since tone systems---tone_system%1:10:00:: typically comprise fewer units---unit%1:24:00:: than either consonant---consonant_system%1:10:00:: or vowel systems---vowel_system%1:10:00:: , we might expect that they would be the easiest part---part%1:24:00:: of a phonologic analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: .
Actual practice---practice%1:04:00:: does not often work out this way---way%1:07:01:: .
Tone systems---tone_system%1:10:00:: are certainly more complex than the number---number%1:07:00:: of units---unit%1:24:00:: would suggest , and often analytically more difficult than much larger consonantal systems---consonantal_system%1:10:00:: .
Welmers---person%1:03:00:: has suggested one explanation---explanation%1:09:00:: .
Tone languages---tone_language%1:10:00:: use for linguistic contrasts---contrast%1:09:01:: speech---speech%1:10:00:: parameters---parameter%1:11:00:: which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use---use%1:04:00:: .
This may both divert the attention---attention%1:09:00:: of the uninitiate---uninitiate%1:14:00:: and cause confusion---confusion%1:09:00:: for the more knowledgeable .
The problem---problem%1:26:00:: is to disentangle the linguistic features---feature%1:09:00:: of pitch---pitch%1:07:00:: from the co-occurring nonlinguistic features---feature%1:09:00:: .
Of course , something of the same sort---sort%1:09:00:: occurs with other sectors---sector%1:09:00:: of the phonology---phonology%1:09:00:: : consonantal articulations---articulation%1:10:00:: have both a linguistic and an individual component---component%1:09:00:: .
But in general the individual variation---variation%1:11:01:: is a small thing---thing%1:07:00:: added onto basic linguistic features---feature%1:09:00:: of greater magnitude---magnitude%1:07:01:: .
With tone---tone%1:07:02:: , individual differences---difference%1:11:00:: may be greater than the linguistic contrasts---contrast%1:24:00:: which are superimposed on them .
Pitch differences from one speaker to another , or from one emotional state to another , may far exceed the small differences---difference%1:07:00:: between tones .
Pitch---pitch%1:07:00:: differences---difference%1:11:00:: from one speaker---speaker%1:18:00:: to another , or from one emotional state---emotional_state%1:26:00:: to another , may far exceed the small differences---difference%1:11:00:: between tones---tone%1:07:02:: .
However , any such suggestion---suggestion%1:09:00:: accounts for only some of the difficulties---difficulty%1:04:00:: in hearing tone---tone%1:07:02:: , or in developing a realistic attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: about tone---tone%1:07:02:: , but not for the analytic difficulties---difficulty%1:04:00:: that occur even when tone---tone%1:07:02:: is meticulously recorded .
A second explanation---explanation%1:09:00:: is suggested by the material---material%1:10:00:: described in Rowlands---person%1:03:00:: ' paper---paper%1:10:01:: .
Tone---tone%1:07:02:: and intonation---intonation%1:10:00:: often become seriously intermeshed .
Neither can be adequately systematized until we are able to separate the two and assign the observed phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: individually to one or the other .
Other pairs---pair%1:14:01:: of phonologic subsystems---subsystem%1:14:00:: also interact or overlap in this way---way%1:07:01:: ; for example , duration---duration%1:28:02:: sometimes figures in both the vowel system---vowel_system%1:10:00:: and the intonation---intonation%1:10:00:: .
Some phonetic features---feature%1:09:00:: , for example glottal catch---glottal_catch%1:10:00:: or murmur---murmur%1:10:01:: , are sometimes to be assigned to segmental phonemics---phonemics%1:09:00:: and sometimes to accentual systems---accentual_system%1:10:00:: .
But no other two phonologic systems---phonologic_system%1:10:00:: are as difficult to disentangle as are tone---tone%1:07:02:: and intonation---intonation%1:10:00:: in some languages---language%1:10:01:: .
This explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: of tone---tone%1:07:02:: difficulties---difficulty%1:09:02:: , however , does not apply in all languages---language%1:10:01:: .
In some ( the Ewe type---type%1:09:00:: mentioned above ) interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: of tone---tone%1:07:02:: and intonation---intonation%1:10:00:: is restricted to the ends---end%1:09:00:: of intonation---intonation%1:10:00:: spans---span%1:28:00:: .
In many of the syllables---syllable%1:10:00:: , intonation---intonation%1:10:00:: can be safely ignored , and much of the tonal analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: can be done without any study---study%1:04:00:: of intonation---intonation%1:10:00:: .
Still , even in such languages---language%1:10:01:: tone---tone%1:07:02:: analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: has not been as simple as one might expect .
A third explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: is suggested by Richardson---person%1:03:00:: 's analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of Sukuma tone---tone%1:07:02:: .
There we see a basically simple phonemic system---phonemic_system%1:10:00:: enmeshed in a very complex and puzzling morphophonemic system---morphophonemic_system%1:10:00:: .
While the phonemes---phoneme%1:10:00:: can be very easily stated , no one is likely to be satisfied with the statement---statement%1:10:02:: until phonemic occurrences---occurrence%1:11:00:: can be related in some way to morphemic units---unit%1:24:00:: , i. e. until the morphophonemics---morphophonemics%1:09:00:: is worked out , or at least far enough that it seems reasonable to expect success---success%1:11:00:: .
In the `` typical tone language---tone_language%1:10:00:: '' , tonal morphophonemics---morphophonemics%1:09:00:: is of the same order---order%1:07:01:: of complexity---complexity%1:07:00:: as consonantal morphophonemics---morphophonemics%1:09:00:: .
The phonemic systems---phonemic_system%1:10:00:: which must support these morphophonemic systems---morphophonemic_system%1:10:00:: , however , are very different .
The inventory---inventory%1:09:00:: of tones---tone%1:07:02:: is much smaller , and commonly the contrasts---contrast%1:24:00:: range along one single dimension---dimension%1:09:00:: , pitch---pitch%1:07:00:: level---level%1:07:00:: .
Consonantal systems---consonantal_system%1:10:00:: are not merely larger , they are multidimensional .
Morphophonemic rules---rule%1:09:01:: may be thought of as joining certain points---point%1:10:03:: in the system .
Morphophonemic rules---rule%1:10:01:: may be thought of as joining certain points---point%1:26:00:: in the system---system%1:14:00:: .
The possibilities---possibility%1:09:03:: in the consonantal system---consonantal_system%1:10:00:: are very numerous , and only a small portion---portion%1:24:00:: of them are actually used .
Phonemes---phoneme%1:10:00:: connected by a morphophonemic rule---rule%1:10:01:: commonly show a good bit---bit%1:11:00:: of phonetic similarity---similarity%1:07:00:: , possible because of the several dimensions---dimension%1:09:00:: of contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: in the system---system%1:14:00:: .
Phonemes connected by a morphophonemic rule---rule%1:09:01:: commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity , possible because of the several dimensions of contrast in the system .
Tonal morphophonemics---morphophonemics%1:09:00:: , in a common case---case%1:11:00:: , can do nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but either raise or lower the tone---tone%1:07:02:: .
The possibilities are few , and the total number of rules---rule%1:09:01:: may be considerably greater .
The possibilities---possibility%1:09:03:: are few , and the total number---number%1:07:00:: of rules---rule%1:10:01:: may be considerably greater .
Often , therefore , there are a number of rules---rule%1:09:01:: having the same effect , and commonly other sets of rules---rule%1:09:01:: as well , having the opposite effect .
Often , therefore , there are a number---number%1:07:00:: of rules---rule%1:10:01:: having the same effect---effect%1:19:00:: , and commonly other sets---set%1:14:00:: of rules---rule%1:10:01:: as well , having the opposite effect---effect%1:19:00:: .
Tonal morphophonemics is much more confusing to the beginning analyst than consonantal morphophonemics , even when the total number of rules---rule%1:09:01:: is no greater .
Tonal morphophonemics---morphophonemics%1:09:00:: is much more confusing to the beginning analyst---analyst%1:18:00:: than consonantal morphophonemics---morphophonemics%1:09:00:: , even when the total number---number%1:07:00:: of rules---rule%1:10:01:: is no greater .
The difficulty---difficulty%1:07:00:: of analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of any subsystem---subsystem%1:14:00:: in the phonology---phonology%1:09:00:: is an inverse function---inverse_function%1:24:00:: of the size---size%1:07:00:: - smaller systems---system%1:14:00:: are more troublesome - for any given degree---degree%1:07:00:: of morphophonemic complexity---complexity%1:07:00:: .
This hypothesis---hypothesis%1:09:00:: will account for a large part---part%1:24:00:: of the difficulties---difficulty%1:26:00:: of tonal analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: , as well as the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that vowel systems---vowel_system%1:10:00:: are often more puzzling than consonantal systems---consonantal_system%1:10:00:: .
The statement---statement%1:10:02:: of the system---system%1:14:00:: is a different matter---matter%1:09:00:: .
Smaller systems---system%1:14:00:: can of course be stated much more succinctly .
A phonemic system---phonemic_system%1:10:00:: can be stated without reference to morphophonemics---morphophonemics%1:09:00:: , but it cannot always be found without morphophonemics---morphophonemics%1:09:00:: .
And the more complex the morphophonemic system is in relation to the phonemic base , the less easily a phonemic system will be analysed without close attention to the morphophonemics - at least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules---rule%1:09:01:: to grammatically meaningful structures .
And the more complex the morphophonemic system---morphophonemic_system%1:10:00:: is in relation to the phonemic base---base%1:09:00:: , the less easily a phonemic system---phonemic_system%1:10:00:: will be analysed without close attention---attention%1:09:00:: to the morphophonemics---morphophonemics%1:09:00:: - at least , the less satisfying will a phonemic statement---statement%1:10:02:: be if it cannot be related through morphophonemic rules---rule%1:10:01:: to grammatically meaningful structures---structure%1:06:00:: .
The design---design%1:09:01:: of orthographies---orthography%1:10:00:: has received much less attention---attention%1:09:02:: from linguists---linguist%1:18:01:: than the problem---problem%1:10:00:: deserves .
There has been a tendency---tendency%1:09:00:: on the part---part%1:09:02:: of many American---american%1:18:00:: linguists---linguist%1:18:01:: to assume that a phonemic transcription---transcription%1:10:00:: will automatically be the best possible orthography---orthography%1:10:00:: and that the only real problem---problem%1:26:00:: will then be the social one of securing acceptance---acceptance%1:09:00:: .
Most others have been content to give only the most general attention---attention%1:09:00:: to the broadest and most obvious features---feature%1:09:00:: of the phonology---phonology%1:09:00:: when designing orthographies---orthography%1:10:00:: .
Apparently the feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: is that anything more would be involvement---involvement%1:04:00:: in technical abstrusenesses---abstruseness%1:07:00:: of possible pedantic interest---interest%1:09:00:: but of no visible significance---significance%1:07:00:: in practical affairs---affair%1:09:00:: .
The result---result%1:19:00:: of this attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: has been the domination---domination%1:04:00:: of many orthography---orthography%1:10:00:: conferences---conference%1:14:00:: by such considerations---consideration%1:10:00:: as typographic ' esthetics---esthetic%1:09:00:: ' , which usually turns out to be nothing more than certain prejudices---prejudice%1:09:01:: carried over from European languages---language%1:10:00:: .
Many of the suggested systems---system%1:14:00:: seem to have only the most tenuous relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: to the language---language%1:10:00:: structures---structure%1:06:00:: that they purport to represent .
Linguists---linguist%1:18:01:: have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people---people%1:14:03:: '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points---point%1:10:03:: while neglecting things---thing%1:09:02:: of much greater significance---significance%1:07:00:: .
Linguists have not always been more enlightened than `` practical people '' and sometimes have insisted on incredibly trivial points---point%1:09:01:: while neglecting things of much greater significance .
As a result---result%1:19:00:: , many people---people%1:14:00:: have been confirmed in their conviction---conviction%1:09:00:: that orthography---orthography%1:10:00:: design---design%1:04:00:: is not an activity---activity%1:04:00:: to which experts---expert%1:18:00:: can contribute anything but confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: .
A. E. Sharp---person%1:03:00:: , in Vowel-Length and Syllabicity in Kikuyu , examines one set---set%1:14:00:: of related orthographic questions---question%1:10:00:: and its phonologic background---background%1:09:01:: in detail .
His objective---objective%1:09:00:: is merely to determine `` what distinctions---distinction%1:09:00:: of length---length%1:07:01:: and syllabicity---syllabicity%1:10:00:: it may be desirable to make explicit in a Kikuyu orthography---orthography%1:10:00:: '' ( 59 ) .
To do so , he finds it necessary to examine the relevant parts---part%1:24:00:: of the phonology---phonology%1:09:00:: thoroughly and in detail .
In the process---process%1:04:00:: , he develops some very significant observations---observation%1:09:02:: about problems---problem%1:10:00:: of a sort---sort%1:09:00:: that are often difficult .
In the process , he develops some very significant observations about problems---problem%1:26:00:: of a sort that are often difficult .
A few of his examples---example%1:09:00:: are of very great interest---interest%1:07:02:: , and the whole discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: of some importance---importance%1:07:00:: for theory---theory%1:09:00:: .
His orthographic recommendations---recommendation%1:10:00:: are no simplistic acceptance---acceptance%1:04:00:: of phonemics---phonemics%1:09:00:: on the one hand or of superficiality---superficiality%1:07:01:: on the other .
Rather he weighs each phonologic fact---fact%1:09:01:: in the light---light%1:09:01:: of its orthographic usefulness---usefulness%1:07:00:: .
He concludes that some changes---change%1:11:00:: can made in the current orthography---orthography%1:10:00:: which will appreciably improve its usefulness---usefulness%1:07:00:: , but hesitates to suggest precise graphic devices---device%1:06:00:: to effect these changes---change%1:11:00:: .
I hope his suggestions---suggestion%1:09:00:: are given the consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: they deserve in Kikuyu circles---circle%1:14:00:: .
This , however , will not exhaust their practical usefulness---usefulness%1:07:00:: , as they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation---investigation%1:04:00:: can contribute to orthography---orthography%1:10:00:: design---design%1:09:01:: .
We need many more studies---study%1:04:00:: of this sort---sort%1:09:00:: if the design---design%1:09:01:: of written languages---written_language%1:10:00:: is to be put on a sound basis---basis%1:09:00:: .

But it would seem more intended as a tract---tract%1:10:00:: advocating the prosodic theory---theory%1:09:00:: than a paper---paper%1:10:01:: directed to the specific problems---problem%1:10:00:: of Igbo phonology---phonology%1:09:00:: .
But it would seem more intended as a tract advocating the prosodic theory than a paper directed to the specific problems---problem%1:26:00:: of Igbo phonology .
The paper---paper%1:10:01:: has a certain value---value%1:07:00:: as a comparatively easy introduction---introduction%1:10:02:: to this approach---approach%1:04:02:: , particularly since it treats a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: where it is possible to compare it with a more traditional ( though not structural ) statement---statement%1:10:02:: .
It does show one feature---feature%1:09:00:: of the system---system%1:14:00:: that has not been previously described .
But it does not , as it claims , demonstrate that this could not be treated by traditional methods---method%1:09:00:: .
Five of the papers---papers%1:10:00:: deal with grammatical problems---problem%1:10:00:: .
Five of the papers deal with grammatical problems---problem%1:26:00:: .
On the whole they maintain much the same high standard---standard%1:10:00:: , but they are much more difficult to discuss in detail because of their wider variety---variety%1:07:00:: of subject matter---subject_matter%1:10:00:: .
My comments---comment%1:10:01:: must be briefer than the papers---papers%1:10:00:: deserve .
W. H. Whiteley---person%1:03:00:: writes on The Verbal Radical in Iraqw .
This must be considered primarily an amendment---amendment%1:04:00:: and supplement---supplement%1:10:00:: to his early A short Description of Item-Categories in Iraqw .
It exhibits much the same descriptive technique---technique%1:09:00:: and is open to much the same criticisms---criticism%1:09:00:: .
The treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: seems unnecessarily loose jointed and complex , largely because the method---method%1:09:00:: is lax and the analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: seems never to be pushed to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point---stopping_point%1:28:00:: .
After only eighteen years---year%1:28:01:: of non-interference---noninterference%1:10:00:: , there were already indications---indication%1:10:00:: of melioration---melioration%1:04:00:: , though `` in a slight degree---degree%1:07:00:: '' , to be sure .
There were more indications---indication%1:10:00:: by the mid twentieth---twentieth%1:24:00:: century---century%1:28:00:: .
I leave it to the statisticians---statistician%1:18:01:: to say what they were , but I noticed several a few years---year%1:28:01:: ago , during an automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: ride---ride%1:04:00:: from Memphis---memphis%1:15:00:: to Hattiesburg---location%1:03:00:: .
In town---town%1:15:00:: after town---town%1:15:00:: my companion---companion%1:18:02:: pointed out the Negro school---school%1:06:00:: and the White school---school%1:06:00:: , and in every instance---instance%1:11:00:: the former made a better appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: ( it was newer , for one thing ) .
It really looked as if a change---change%1:11:00:: of the sort---sort%1:09:00:: predicted by Booker T. Washington---person%1:03:00:: had been going on .
But with the renewal---renewal%1:04:01:: of interference---interference%1:04:00:: in 1954 ( as with its beginning---beginning%1:28:00:: in 1835 ) , the improvement---improvement%1:04:00:: was impaired .
For over a hundred years---year%1:28:01:: Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: have felt that the North---north%1:15:02:: was picking on them .
It 's infuriating , this feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: that one is being picked on , continually , constantly .
By what right---right%1:07:00:: of superior virtue---virtue%1:07:01:: , Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: ask , do the people---people%1:14:00:: of the North---north%1:15:02:: do this ?
The traditional strategy---strategy%1:09:00:: of the South---south%1:15:01:: has been to expose the vices---vice%1:07:00:: of the North---north%1:15:02:: , to demonstrate that the North---north%1:15:02:: possessed no superior virtue---virtue%1:07:01:: , to `` show the world---world%1:14:02:: that '' ( as James---person%1:03:00:: 's Christopher Newman---person%1:03:00:: said to his adversaries---adversary%1:18:00:: ) `` however bad I may be , you 're not quite the people---people%1:14:00:: to say it '' .
In the pre Civil War---civil_war%1:04:00:: years---year%1:28:01:: , the South---south%1:15:01:: argued that the slave---slave%1:18:00:: was not less humanely treated than the factory worker---factory_worker%1:18:00:: of the North---north%1:15:02:: .
At the present time , the counter-attack---counterattack%1:04:00:: takes the line---line%1:09:01:: that there 's no more of the true spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: of `` integration---integration%1:04:00:: '' in the North---north%1:15:02:: than in the South---south%1:15:01:: .
The line---line%1:09:01:: is a pretty good one .
People---people%1:14:00:: talk about `` the law---law%1:09:00:: of the land---land%1:15:01:: '' .
The expression---expression%1:10:00:: has become quite a cliche---cliche%1:10:00:: .
But people---people%1:14:00:: can n't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law .
But people---people%1:14:01:: can n't be made to integrate , socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards---standard%1:09:00:: ) by law---law%1:10:00:: .
I was having lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: not long ago ( apologies---apology%1:10:00:: to N. V. Peale---person%1:03:00:: ) with three distinguished historians---historian%1:18:00:: ( one specializing in the European Middle Ages---middle_ages%1:28:00:: , one in American history---history%1:09:00:: , and one in the Far East---far_east%1:15:00:: ) , and I asked them if they could name instances---instance%1:11:00:: where the general mores---mores%1:09:00:: had been radically changed with `` deliberate speed---speed%1:07:00:: , majestic instancy---instancy%1:07:01:: '' ( Francis Thompson---person%1:03:00:: 's words---words%1:10:04:: for the Hound of Heaven 's pursuit---pursuit%1:04:00:: ) by judicial fiat---fiat%1:10:00:: .
A Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: judge---judge%1:18:00:: a while back cited a Roman jurist---jurist%1:18:00:: to the effect---effect%1:10:00:: that ten years---year%1:28:01:: might be a reasonable length---length%1:07:01:: of time---time%1:28:05:: for such a change---change%1:04:00:: .
But I suspect that the old Roman---roman%1:18:00:: was referring to change---change%1:04:00:: made under military occupation---occupation%1:04:02:: - the sort---sort%1:09:00:: of change---change%1:04:00:: which Tacitus---person%1:03:00:: was talking about when he said , `` They make a desert---desert%1:15:00:: , and call it peace---peace%1:26:01:: '' ( `` Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' . )
But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation - the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said , `` They make a desert , and call it peace---peace%1:26:00:: '' ( `` Solitudinem faciunt , pacem appellant '' . )
Moreover , the law---law%1:09:00:: of the land---land%1:15:01:: is not irrevocable ; it can be changed ; it has been , many times---time%1:11:00:: .
Mr. Justice Taney---person%1:03:00:: 's Dred Scott---person%1:03:00:: decision---decision%1:09:00:: in 1857 was unpopular in the North---north%1:15:02:: , and soon became a dead letter---dead_letter%1:26:00:: .
Prohibition---prohibition%1:10:02:: was the law---law%1:09:00:: of the land---land%1:15:01:: , but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters---oldster%1:18:00:: took up drinking---drinking%1:04:01:: in prohibition---prohibition%1:28:00:: days---day%1:28:05:: , drinking---drinking%1:04:01:: was so gay , so fashionable , especially in the sophisticated Northeast---northeast%1:15:00:: ! )
The cliche---cliche%1:10:00:: loses its talismanic virtue---virtue%1:07:01:: in the light---light%1:09:01:: of a little history---history%1:09:01:: .
The Declaration of Independence---declaration_of_independence%1:10:00:: says that `` governments---government%1:14:00:: derive their just powers---power%1:18:00:: from the consent---consent%1:10:00:: of the governed---governed%1:14:00:: '' .
The phrase---phrase%1:10:00:: `` consent---consent%1:10:00:: of the governed---governed%1:14:00:: '' needs a hard look---look%1:04:00:: .
Is the consent---consent%1:10:00:: of the governed---governed%1:14:00:: a numerical majority---majority%1:23:00:: ?
Calhoun---person%1:03:00:: dealt with this question---question%1:10:01:: in his `` Disquisition on Government '' .
To guard against the tyranny---tyranny%1:14:00:: of a numerical majority---majority%1:23:00:: , Calhoun---person%1:03:00:: developed his theory---theory%1:09:00:: of `` concurrent majority---majority%1:23:00:: '' , which , he said , `` by giving to each portion---portion%1:24:00:: of the community---community%1:14:00:: which may be unequally affected by the action---action%1:04:02:: of government---government%1:14:00:: , a negative---negative%1:10:00:: on the others , prevents all partial or local legislation---legislation%1:04:00:: '' .
Who will say that our country---country%1:14:01:: is even now a homogeneous community---community%1:14:00:: ?
that regional peculiarities---peculiarity%1:09:00:: do not still exist ?
that the Court order---court_order%1:10:00:: does not unequally affect the Southern region---region%1:15:00:: ?
Who will deny that in a vast portion---portion%1:24:00:: of the South---south%1:15:01:: the Federal action---action%1:04:02:: is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept---concept%1:09:00:: of `` the consent---consent%1:10:00:: of the governed---governed%1:14:00:: '' ?
Circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: alter cases---case%1:04:00:: .
A friend---friend%1:18:00:: of mine in New Mexico---new_mexico%1:15:00:: said the Court order---court_order%1:10:00:: had caused no particular trouble out there , that all had gone as merry as a marriage---marriage%1:04:00:: bell---bell%1:06:00:: .
I murmured something about a possible difference---difference%1:07:00:: between New Mexico---new_mexico%1:15:00:: 's history---history%1:10:00:: and Mississippi---mississippi%1:15:00:: 's .
One can meet with aloofness---aloofness%1:12:02:: almost anywhere : the Thank-Heaven-We 're - not-Involved viewpoint---viewpoint%1:09:00:: , It Does n't Affect Us !
Southern Liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: ( there are a good many ) - especially if they 're rich - often exhibit blithe insouciance---insouciance%1:12:00:: .
The trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: here is that it 's almost too easy to take the high moral ground---ground%1:16:00:: when it does n't cost you anything .
You 've already sent your daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: to Miss X---person%1:03:00:: 's select academy---academy%1:14:00:: for girls---girl%1:18:02:: and your son---son%1:18:00:: to Mr. Y---person%1:03:00:: 's select academy---academy%1:14:00:: for boys---boy%1:18:00:: , and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity---impunity%1:26:00:: .
If there 's no suitable academy---academy%1:14:00:: in your own neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: , there 's always New England---new_england%1:15:00:: .
New England---new_england%1:15:00:: academies---academy%1:14:00:: welcome fugitives---fugitive%1:18:01:: from the provinces---province%1:15:00:: , South---south%1:15:01:: as well as West---west%1:15:01:: .
They may even enroll a colored student---student%1:18:00:: or two for show---show%1:10:03:: , though he usually turns out to be from Thailand---thailand%1:15:00:: , or any place---place%1:15:01:: other than the American South---south%1:15:00:: .
It would be interesting to know how much `` integration---integration%1:04:00:: '' there is in the famous , fashionable colleges---college%1:14:00:: and prep schools---prep_school%1:14:00:: of New England---new_england%1:15:00:: .
A recent newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: report---report%1:10:00:: said there were five Negroes---negro%1:18:00:: in the 1960 graduating class---graduating_class%1:14:00:: of nearly one thousand at Yale---yale%1:06:00:: ; that is , about one-half---one-half%1:23:00:: of one per cent---percent%1:24:00:: , which looks pretty `` tokenish '' to me , especially in an institution---institution%1:14:00:: which professes to be `` national '' .
I must confess that I prefer the Liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: who is personally affected , who is willing to send his own children---child%1:18:01:: to a mixed school---school%1:14:00:: as proof---proof%1:09:00:: of his faith---faith%1:04:00:: .
I leave out of account---account%1:10:04:: the question---question%1:10:01:: of the best interests---interest%1:07:01:: of the children---child%1:18:01:: , the question---question%1:10:01:: of what their best interests---interest%1:07:01:: really are .
I 'm talking about the grand manner---manner%1:07:01:: of the Liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: - North---north%1:15:02:: and South---south%1:15:01:: - who is not affected personally .
If these people---people%1:14:00:: were denied a voice---voice%1:04:00:: ( do they have a moral right---right%1:07:00:: to a voice---voice%1:04:00:: ? )
, what voices---voice%1:04:00:: would be left ?
Well , after everybody has followed the New England---new_england%1:15:00:: pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: of segregating one 's children---child%1:18:01:: into private schools---private_school%1:14:00:: , only the poor folks---folk%1:14:00:: are left .
And it is precisely in this poorer economic class---class%1:14:01:: that one finds , and has always found , the most racial friction---friction%1:26:00:: .
A dear , respected friend---friend%1:18:00:: of mine , who like myself grew up in the South---south%1:15:01:: and has spent many years---year%1:28:01:: in New England---new_england%1:15:00:: , said to me not long ago : `` I can n't forgive New England---new_england%1:15:00:: for rejecting all complicity---complicity%1:26:00:: '' .
Being a teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: of American literature---literature%1:09:00:: , I remembered Whittier---person%1:03:00:: 's `` Massachusetts to Virginia '' , where he said : `` But that one dark loathsome burden---burden%1:09:01:: ye must stagger with alone , And reap the bitter harvest---harvest%1:20:00:: which ye yourselves have sown '' .
There is a legend---legend%1:10:01:: ( Hawthorne---person%1:03:00:: records it in his `` English Notebooks '' .
and one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page ) to the effect---effect%1:19:00:: that the Mayflower---mayflower%1:06:00:: on its second voyage---voyage%1:04:00:: brought a cargo---cargo%1:06:00:: of Negro slaves---slave%1:18:00:: .
and one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage---voyage%1:04:01:: brought a cargo of Negro slaves .
Whether historically a fact---fact%1:26:01:: or not , the legend---legend%1:10:01:: has a certain symbolic value---value%1:07:00:: .
Complicity---complicity%1:26:00:: is an embarrassing word---word%1:10:00:: .
Like the cowboy---cowboy%1:18:00:: in Stephen Crane---person%1:03:00:: 's `` Blue Hotel '' , we run around crying , `` Well , I did n't do anything , did I '' ?
Robert Penn Warren---person%1:03:00:: puts it this way---way%1:07:01:: in `` Brother to Dragons '' :
`` The recognition---recognition%1:26:00:: of complicity---complicity%1:26:00:: is the beginning---beginning%1:15:00:: of innocence---innocence%1:07:01:: '' , where innocence---innocence%1:07:01:: , I think , means about the same thing---thing%1:06:00:: as redemption---redemption%1:04:01:: .
A man---man%1:18:04:: must be able to say , `` Father---father%1:18:01:: , I have sinned '' , or there is no hope---hope%1:09:00:: for him .
A man must be able to say , `` Father---father%1:18:02:: , I have sinned '' , or there is no hope for him .
Lincoln---person%1:03:00:: understood this better than most when he said in his `` Second Inaugural---inaugural%1:10:00:: '' that God---god%1:18:00:: `` gives to both North---north%1:15:01:: and South---south%1:15:00:: this terrible war---war%1:26:00:: , as the woe---woe%1:26:00:: due to those by whom the offense---offense%1:04:01:: came '' .
He also spoke of `` the wealth---wealth%1:07:00:: piled by the bondsman---bondsman%1:18:01:: 's two hundred and fifty years---year%1:28:01:: in unrequited toil '' .
Lincoln---person%1:03:00:: was historian---historian%1:18:00:: and economist---economist%1:18:00:: enough to know that a substantial portion---portion%1:21:00:: of this wealth---wealth%1:26:00:: had accumulated in the hands---hands%1:04:00:: of the descendants---descendants%1:14:00:: of New Englanders---new_englander%1:18:00:: engaged in the slave trade---slave_trade%1:04:00:: .
After how many generations---generation%1:28:00:: is such wealth---wealth%1:07:00:: ( mounting all the while---while%1:28:00:: through the manipulations---manipulation%1:04:00:: of high finance---high_finance%1:04:00:: ) purified of taint---taint%1:26:00:: ?
It is a question---question%1:10:01:: which New Englanders---new_englander%1:18:00:: long ago put out of their minds---mind%1:09:00:: .
The slaves---slave%1:18:00:: never shared in their profits---profits%1:21:01:: , while they did share , in a very real sense---sense%1:10:00:: , in the profits---profits%1:21:01:: of the slave---slave%1:18:00:: owners---owner%1:18:02:: : they were fed , clothed , doctored , and so forth ; they were the beneficiaries---beneficiary%1:18:00:: of responsible , paternalistic care---care%1:04:01:: .
The slaves never shared in their profits , while they did share , in a very real sense , in the profits of the slave owners : they were fed , clothed , doctored , and so forth ; they were the beneficiaries of responsible , paternalistic care---care%1:12:00:: .
Emerson---person%1:03:00:: - Platonist---platonist%1:18:00:: , idealist---idealist%1:18:00:: , doctrinaire - sounded a high Transcendental note---note%1:10:05:: in his `` Boston Hymn '' , delivered in 1863 in the Boston---boston%1:15:00:: Music Hall---location%1:03:00:: amidst thundering applause---applause%1:10:00:: : `` Pay ransom---ransom%1:21:00:: to the owner---owner%1:18:02:: and fill the bag---bag%1:06:00:: to the brim---brim%1:06:01:: .
Who is the owner---owner%1:18:00:: ?
The slave---slave%1:18:00:: is owner---owner%1:18:02:: , And ever was .
It is the abstractionism---abstractionism%1:06:00:: , the unrealism---unrealism%1:09:00:: , of the pure idealist---idealist%1:18:00:: .
It ignores the sordid financial aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: ( quite conveniently , too , for his audience---audience%1:14:00:: , who could indulge in moral indignation---indignation%1:12:00:: without visible , or even conscious , discomfort---discomfort%1:26:00:: , their money---money%1:21:02:: from the transaction---transaction%1:04:00:: having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage---brokerage%1:14:00:: ) .
Like Pilate---person%1:03:00:: , they had washed their hands .
Can God---god%1:18:00:: be mocked , ever , in the long run ?
New Englanders---new_englander%1:18:00:: were a bit sensitive on the subject---subject%1:10:00:: of their complicity---complicity%1:26:00:: in Negro---negro%1:18:00:: slavery---slavery%1:04:01:: at the time---time%1:28:00:: of the drafting---drafting%1:04:01:: of the Declaration of Independence---declaration_of_independence%1:10:00:: , as Jefferson---person%1:03:00:: explained in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause---clause%1:10:01:: reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants---inhabitant%1:18:00:: of Africa---africa%1:17:00:: was struck out in complaisance---complaisance%1:07:00:: to South Carolina---south_carolina%1:15:01:: and Georgia---georgia%1:15:02:: , who had never attempted to restrain the importation---importation%1:04:00:: of slaves---slave%1:18:00:: , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it .
New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery---slavery%1:26:00:: at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence , as Jefferson explained in his `` Autobiography '' : `` The clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia , who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves , and who on the contrary still wished to continue it .
Our Northern brethren---brother%1:18:02:: also I believe felt a little tender under those censures---censure%1:10:00:: ; for though their people---people%1:14:01:: had very few slaves---slave%1:18:00:: themselves , yet they had been pretty considerable carriers---carrier%1:18:03:: of them to others '' .
But that was a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: ago .
The New England---new_england%1:15:00:: conscience---conscience%1:12:00:: became desensitized .
George W. Cable---person%1:03:00:: ( naturalized New Englander---new_englander%1:18:00:: ) , writing in 1889 from `` Paradise Road , Northampton---location%1:03:00:: '' ( lovely symbolic name---name%1:10:00:: ) , agitated continuously the `` Southern question---question%1:10:01:: '' .
New England---new_england%1:15:00:: , as everyone knows , has long been schoolmaster to the Nation---nation%1:14:01:: .
There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area---area%1:15:01:: the chief universities---university%1:14:00:: , colleges---college%1:14:00:: , and preparatory schools---preparatory_school%1:14:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
It is true that New England---new_england%1:15:00:: , more than any other section---section%1:15:01:: , was dedicated to education---education%1:04:00:: from the start---start%1:28:00:: .
How did it happen , for example , that the state university---university%1:14:00:: , that great symbol---symbol%1:10:00:: of American democracy---democracy%1:14:00:: , failed to flourish in New England---new_england%1:15:00:: as it did in other parts---part%1:15:00:: of the country---country%1:15:00:: ?
Is n't it a bit odd that the three states---state%1:15:01:: of Southern New England---new_england%1:15:00:: ( Massachusetts---massachusetts%1:15:00:: , Connecticut---connecticut%1:15:00:: , and Rhode Island---rhode_island%1:15:00:: ) have had state---state%1:15:01:: institutions---institution%1:06:00:: of university---university%1:14:00:: status---status%1:26:00:: only in the very recent past---past%1:28:00:: , these institutions---institution%1:06:00:: having previously been A + M colleges---group%1:03:00:: ?
Was it supposed , perchance , that A + M---group%1:03:00:: ( vocational training---vocational_training%1:09:00:: , that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class---immigrant_class%1:14:00:: which flooded that part---part%1:15:00:: of the New England---new_england%1:15:00:: world---world%1:17:02:: in the post Civil War---civil_war%1:04:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: , the immigrants---immigrant%1:18:00:: having been brought in from Southern Europe---europe%1:17:00:: , to work in the mills---mill%1:06:01:: , to make up for the labor---labor%1:14:00:: shortage---shortage%1:07:00:: caused by migration---migration%1:04:00:: to the West---west%1:15:01:: ?
Is it not ironical that Roger Williams---person%1:03:00:: 's state---state%1:15:01:: , Rhode Island---rhode_island%1:15:00:: , should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university---university%1:14:00:: ?
The state universities---university%1:14:00:: of Maine---maine%1:15:00:: , New Hampshire---new_hampshire%1:15:00:: , And Vermont---vermont%1:15:00:: are older and more `` respectable '' ; they had less immigration---immigration%1:04:00:: to contend with .
A Yale---yale%1:06:00:: historian---historian%1:18:00:: , writing a few years---year%1:28:01:: ago in The Yale Review , said : `` We in New England---new_england%1:15:00:: have long since segregated our children---child%1:18:01:: '' .
He was referring not only to the general college---college%1:14:00:: situation---situation%1:26:00:: but more especially to the preparatory schools---preparatory_school%1:14:00:: .
And what a galaxy---galaxy%1:14:01:: of those adorns that fair land---land%1:15:01:: !
I do n't propose to go into their history---history%1:10:00:: , but I have one or two surmises---surmise%1:10:00:: .
One---one%1:23:00:: is that they were established , or gained eminence---eminence%1:26:00:: , under pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: provided by these same immigrants---immigrant%1:18:00:: , from whom the old families---family%1:14:00:: wished to segregate their children---child%1:18:01:: .
In the early days---early_days%1:28:00:: of a homogeneous population---population%1:14:00:: , the public school---public_school%1:14:00:: was quite satisfactory .
Up to date , however , his garden---garden%1:06:00:: was still more or less of a mess---mess%1:26:00:: , he had n't even started his workshop---workshop%1:06:00:: and if there was a meadow---meadow%1:15:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: in the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: he had n't found it .
It was n't his fault---fault%1:04:00:: that these things---thing%1:26:00:: were so .
The difficulty---difficulty%1:09:02:: was that each day---day%1:28:00:: seemed to produce its quota---quota%1:23:00:: of details---detail%1:09:00:: which must be cleaned up immediately .
As a result---result%1:19:00:: , life---life%1:09:00:: had become a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of continuous make-ready---makeready%1:04:00:: .
Once he disposed of these items---item%1:10:00:: which screamed so harshly for attention---attention%1:09:00:: , he could undertake the things---thing%1:04:00:: which really counted .
Once he disposed of these items---item%1:06:00:: which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted .
Then , at last , his day---day%1:28:04:: would fall into an ordered pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods---woods%1:14:00:: in the late afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: , accompanied by his dogs---dog%1:05:00:: .
His dogs---dog%1:05:00:: ?
He had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part---part%1:04:01:: in his early dreams---dream%1:09:02:: .
He had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams---dream%1:12:00:: .
Then they had always been romping around him on these walks , yelping with delight---delight%1:12:00:: , dashing off into the bushes---bush%1:20:00:: on fruitless hunting expeditions---hunting_expedition%1:04:00:: , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws---paw%1:05:00:: .
Dogs---dog%1:05:00:: did something to one 's ego---ego%1:12:01:: .
They were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world 's great guys---guy%1:18:00:: .
Regardless of how much of a slob---slob%1:18:00:: you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out - and even if they did it would make no difference---difference%1:07:00:: .
Now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs---dog%1:05:00:: in the picture---picture%1:26:00:: .
What in the world---world%1:17:01:: were you going to do with a lot of dogs---dog%1:05:00:: when you left for town---town%1:15:00:: on Monday---monday%1:28:00:: afternoons---afternoon%1:28:00:: ?
You certainly could n't take them into the little apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days---day%1:28:00:: every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous breakdowns---nervous_breakdown%1:26:00:: .
Why in the world---world%1:17:01:: could n't he live in one place---place%1:15:01:: the way---way%1:07:01:: everyone else seemed to ?
It worried him , this inability---inability%1:09:00:: to get the simplest things---thing%1:04:00:: done in the course---course%1:14:00:: of a day---day%1:28:00:: .
He would wake up in the middle of the night---night%1:28:00:: and fret about it .
How in the world---world%1:17:01:: had he formerly found time---time%1:28:05:: to build up a business---business%1:14:00:: , raise a family---family%1:14:00:: , be on half a dozen boards---board%1:14:00:: , work actively on committees---committee%1:14:00:: and either go out in the evening---evening%1:28:00:: or plow through the contents---content%1:14:00:: of a bulging brief case---briefcase%1:06:00:: ?
Was it possible that as people---people%1:14:00:: grow older the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of time---time%1:03:00:: changed ?
Could it be that it speeded up for the aged---aged%1:14:00:: in some mysterious way---way%1:07:01:: , as if a bored universe---universe%1:17:00:: were skipping through the end---end%1:09:00:: of the chapter---chapter%1:28:00:: just to get it over with ?
Or was the answer---answer%1:10:02:: less metaphysical ?
Did older people---people%1:14:00:: work more slowly ?
Did it take a man---man%1:18:00:: of sixty-five longer to write a letter---letter%1:10:00:: , shave , clean out a barn---barn%1:06:00:: , read a newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: , than a man---man%1:18:00:: of thirty ?
Did men---man%1:18:00:: become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go ?
Did men---man%1:18:04:: become perfectionists---perfectionist%1:18:00:: as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go ?
It might be that certain people---people%1:14:00:: were born with a compulsion---compulsion%1:16:01:: to complicate their lives---life%1:09:00:: , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizards---lizard%1:05:00:: in the sun---sun%1:19:00:: , too indolent to blink their eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
Perhaps it was his misfortune---misfortune%1:26:00:: , or good fortune---good_fortune%1:26:00:: , whichever way---way%1:07:01:: one looked at it , to belong to the former group---group%1:03:00:: , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure---pressure%1:26:00:: in a world---world%1:14:01:: which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to it .
And then again perhaps the reason---reason%1:10:01:: why he could n't find time---time%1:28:05:: to do any of the things---thing%1:04:00:: he had planned to do after retirement---retirement%1:26:00:: : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back---back%1:08:00:: and watching the clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: go by , was because he did n't want to do them .
There was no compulsion---compulsion%1:16:01:: behind them .
During all his busy life---life%1:26:02:: he had only done things---thing%1:04:00:: which had to be done .
This habit---habit%1:04:02:: had become so fixed over the years---year%1:28:00:: that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting .
He looked at the luminous dial---dial%1:06:00:: of his wrist watch---wrist_watch%1:06:00:: .
It was five minutes---minute%1:28:00:: after four---four%1:23:00:: .
On some distant farm---farm%1:06:00:: a rooster---rooster%1:05:00:: crowed and , far down the valley---valley%1:17:00:: , an associate---associate%1:18:00:: answered .
He turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet---sheet%1:06:00:: over his head---head%1:08:00:: against the treacherous encroachment---encroachment%1:11:00:: of the dawn---dawn%1:28:00:: .
At least he could buy the equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: for his workshop---workshop%1:06:00:: .
Thus committed , action---action%1:04:02:: might follow .
He went down to Mills and Bradley---group%1:03:00:: 's Hardware Store---hardware_store%1:06:00:: and bought a full set---set%1:14:00:: of carpenter---carpenter%1:18:00:: 's tools---tool%1:06:00:: , including a rotary power saw---power_saw%1:06:00:: and several other pieces---piece%1:06:05:: of power machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: that Mr. Mills---person%1:03:00:: said were essential for babbiting and doweling---doweling%1:04:00:: , whatever they were .
He also bought a huge square---square%1:25:00:: of pegboard---pegboard%1:06:00:: for hanging up his tools---tool%1:06:00:: , and lumber---lumber%1:27:00:: for his workbench---workbench%1:06:00:: , sandpaper---sandpaper%1:27:00:: and glue---glue%1:27:00:: and assorted nails---nail%1:06:00:: , levels---level%1:06:00:: and T squares---t-square%1:06:00:: and plumb lines---plumb_line%1:06:00:: and several gadgets---gadget%1:06:00:: that he had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: how to use or what they were for .
`` There '' , said Mr. Mills---person%1:03:00:: .
Add things---thing%1:06:00:: as you find you need ' em '' .
He did n't even ask the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of this collection---collection%1:14:00:: .
After all , if you were going to set up a workshop---workshop%1:06:00:: you had to have the proper equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: and that was that .
When he returned home , the station wagon---station_wagon%1:06:00:: loaded with tools---tool%1:06:00:: , Jinny---person%1:03:00:: had gone with a friend---friend%1:18:00:: to some meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: in the village---village%1:14:00:: , using the recently purchased second car---car%1:06:00:: .
It gave him a chance---chance%1:26:00:: to unload the stuff---stuff%1:06:00:: and get it down to the cellar---cellar%1:06:00:: without a barrage---barrage%1:10:00:: of acid comments---comment%1:10:00:: .
He had made such a fuss---fuss%1:26:00:: about buying that second car---car%1:06:00:: that he knew he was vulnerable .
He piled everything neatly in a corner---corner%1:06:02:: of the cellar---cellar%1:06:00:: and turned to stare at the blank stone---stone%1:06:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
That was where the pegboard---pegboard%1:06:00:: would go on which he would hang his hand tools---hand_tool%1:06:00:: .
In front of it would be his workbench---workbench%1:06:00:: .
The old nightmare---nightmare%1:09:00:: which had caused him so many wakeful hours---hour%1:28:00:: came charging in on him once more , only this time---time%1:11:00:: he could n't pacify it with a sleeping pill---sleeping_pill%1:06:00:: and send it away .
How in the world---world%1:17:01:: did one attach a pegboard---pegboard%1:06:00:: to a stone---stone%1:06:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: ?
How did one attach anything to a stone---stone%1:06:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: , for that matter ?
After the pegboard---pegboard%1:06:00:: there would be the paneling---paneling%1:06:00:: .
He sat down on an old box---box%1:06:00:: and focused on the problem---problem%1:10:00:: .
Perhaps one bored holes---hole%1:06:00:: in the stone---stone%1:27:00:: with some kind---kind%1:09:00:: of an electric gadget---gadget%1:06:00:: .
But then , when you stuck things---thing%1:06:00:: into the holes---hole%1:06:00:: , why did n't they come right out again ?
He turned his attention---attention%1:09:00:: to the workbench---workbench%1:06:00:: .
Perhaps that was the first thing---thing%1:04:00:: to do .
A workbench---workbench%1:06:00:: had a heavy top---top%1:15:01:: and sturdy legs---leg%1:06:01:: , but how did you attach sturdy legs---leg%1:06:01:: to a heavy top---top%1:15:01:: so that the whole thing did n't wobble like a newborn calf---calf%1:05:00:: and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ?
Mr. Mills---person%1:03:00:: had done some figuring on a scrap---scrap%1:17:00:: of paper---paper%1:27:00:: and given him the various kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of boards---board%1:27:00:: and two-by-fours---two-by-four%1:06:00:: which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench---workbench%1:06:00:: .
They lay on the cellar---cellar%1:06:00:: floor---floor%1:06:00:: in a disorderly pile---pile%1:14:00:: .
Mr. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: poked at it gingerly with his foot---foot%1:08:01:: .
How could anyone know what to do with an assortment---assortment%1:14:00:: like that ?
Perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard---pegboard%1:06:00:: and build the workbench---workbench%1:06:00:: - someone who knew what he was about .
Then at least he would have a place---place%1:15:05:: to hang his tools---tool%1:06:00:: and something to work on .
He went upstairs to phone Crumb---person%1:03:00:: .
To his amazement---amazement%1:12:00:: he reached him .
Mr. Crumb---person%1:03:00:: was laid up with a bad cold---cold%1:26:00:: .
He did n't seem to think that attaching a pegboard---pegboard%1:06:00:: to a stone---stone%1:06:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: was much of a problem---problem%1:26:00:: and he tossed off the building---building%1:04:00:: of the worktable---worktable%1:06:00:: equally lightly .
The only trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: was that he himself was tied up on the school---school%1:14:00:: job---job%1:04:01:: .
That was why he had n't been able to finish the porch---porch%1:06:00:: .
No , he did n't know of any handyman---handyman%1:18:00:: carpenter---carpenter%1:18:00:: .
There was n't any such thing---thing%1:06:01:: any more .
Carpenters---carpenter%1:18:00:: all wanted steady work---work%1:04:01:: and at the moment---moment%1:28:00:: every mother's son for twenty miles---mile%1:23:01:: around that could hammer nails---nail%1:06:00:: for twenty-five dollars---dollar%1:21:00:: a day---day%1:28:04:: was working on the school---school%1:14:00:: job---job%1:04:01:: .
There was a fellow---fellow%1:18:00:: named Blatz---person%1:03:00:: over Smithtown---location%1:03:00:: way---way%1:15:00:: .
Mr. Crumb---person%1:03:00:: would probably see him at Lodge---group%1:03:00:: Meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: the next night---night%1:28:00:: .
If he was sober , which was doubtful , he 'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: .
Mr. Blatz---person%1:03:00:: had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest boon---boon%1:26:00:: that had come into Mr. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: 's life---life%1:26:02:: since he moved to Highfield---location%1:03:00:: , in spite of the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that he did n't work very fast or very long at a time , and he did n't like to work at all unless Mr. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: hung around and talked to him .
He said he was the lonely type---type%1:18:00:: and working in a cellar---cellar%1:06:00:: you saw funny things---thing%1:06:01:: coming out of the cracks---crack%1:17:00:: in the wall---wall%1:06:00:: if they was n't nobody with you .
So Mr. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: sat on a wooden box---box%1:06:00:: and talked in order to keep Mr. Blatz---person%1:03:00:: 's mind---mind%1:09:00:: from funny things---thing%1:06:01:: .
At the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards---pegboard%1:06:00:: to stone---stone%1:06:00:: walls---wall%1:06:00:: , but Mr. Blatz---person%1:03:00:: was usually standing in his line of vision---line_of_vision%1:15:00:: and it all seemed so simple that he did n't like to disclose his ignorance---ignorance%1:09:00:: .
While Mr. Blatz---person%1:03:00:: was putting up the pegboards---pegboard%1:06:00:: and starting the workbench---workbench%1:06:00:: , Mr. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: told him of this idea---idea%1:09:00:: about paneling the whole end---end%1:15:02:: of the cellar---cellar%1:06:00:: .
Mr. Blatz---person%1:03:00:: agreed that this would be pretty .
Without further discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: he appeared the next morning---morning%1:28:00:: with a pile---pile%1:14:00:: of boards---board%1:27:00:: sticking over the end---end%1:15:00:: of his light truck---truck%1:06:00:: and proceeded with the paneling---paneling%1:06:00:: , which he then stained and waxed according to his taste---taste%1:12:02:: .
`` Now '' , he said , `` we got to put in some outlets---outlet%1:06:02:: for them power tools---power_tool%1:06:00:: ; then a couple of fluorescent lamps---lamp%1:06:00:: over the workbench---workbench%1:06:00:: an ' I guess we 're about through down here '' .
There was no question---question%1:07:00:: of that .
`` By the way '' , said Mr. Blatz---person%1:03:00:: , packing his tools---tool%1:06:00:: into a battered carrier---carrier%1:06:03:: , `` them power tools---power_tool%1:06:00:: needs extra voltage---voltage%1:19:02:: .
Before you use ' em the light---light%1:06:00:: company---company%1:14:01:: 's got to run in a heavy line---line%1:06:01:: and you 'll need a new fuse---fuse%1:06:01:: box---box%1:06:00:: for the extra circuits---circuit%1:06:00:: .
That ai n't too bad ' ceptin ' the light company---light_company%1:14:00:: 's so busy you can n't ever get ' em to do nothin '' ' .
Instead of being depressed by this news---news%1:10:00:: , Mr. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: was actually relieved .
At least the moment---moment%1:28:00:: was postponed when he had to face the mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: of the power tools---power_tool%1:06:00:: .
He followed Mr. Blatz---person%1:03:00:: up the cellar---cellar%1:06:00:: stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: .
As usual , Mrs. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: was standing in the midst of a confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: of cooking utensils---cooking_utensil%1:06:00:: .
Mr. Blatz---person%1:03:00:: sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: chair---chair%1:06:00:: .
`` Well '' , he said , `` got your man---man%1:18:00:: fixed up nice down there .
He oughta be able to build a new house---house%1:06:00:: with all them contraptions---contraption%1:06:00:: '' .
Mr. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: watched his wife---wife%1:18:00:: with an anxious expression---expression%1:07:00:: .
Mr. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: could n't remember his saying any such thing---thing%1:10:00:: .
`` Oh , that 's wonderful '' , cried Mrs. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: .
`` I have a thousand things---thing%1:04:00:: for you to do .
Doors---door%1:06:00:: that won n't open , and doors---door%1:06:00:: that won n't close and shelves---shelf%1:06:00:: and broken '' .
`` But those are the things---thing%1:04:00:: I built the workshop---workshop%1:06:00:: for '' , protested Mr. Crombie---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Those are the things---thing%1:04:00:: I can do , now that I 'm set up '' .
`` I 've been waiting to get these things---thing%1:04:00:: done for months---month%1:28:01:: '' , she said .
But the discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: was academic .
Mr. Blatz---person%1:03:00:: was already taking measurements for a shelf---shelf%1:06:00:: above the kitchen sink---kitchen_sink%1:06:00:: .
When several minutes---minute%1:28:00:: had passed and Curt---person%1:03:00:: had n't emerged from the livery stable---livery_stable%1:06:00:: , Brenner---person%1:03:00:: re-entered the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: and faced Summers---person%1:03:00:: across the counter---counter%1:06:00:: .
`` I have a little job---job%1:04:01:: for you , Charlie---person%1:03:00:: .
I 'm sure you won n't mind doing me a small favor---favor%1:04:00:: '' .
Brenner---person%1:03:00:: 's voice---voice%1:07:00:: was oily , but Summers---person%1:03:00:: was n't fooled .
He moistened his lips---lip%1:08:00:: uneasily .
`` What is it you want me to do , Mr. Brenner---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Brenner---person%1:03:00:: shrugged carelessly .
I just want you to take a message---message%1:10:01:: to Diane Molinari---person%1:03:00:: .
Tell her to come here to the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: '' .
Vastly relieved , Summers---person%1:03:00:: nodded and started toward the door---door%1:06:01:: .
`` One thing---thing%1:09:01:: , Summers---person%1:03:00:: '' , Brenner---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` You 're not to mention my name---name%1:10:00:: .
Tell her Curt Adams---person%1:03:00:: wants to see her '' .
Summers---person%1:03:00:: pulled up short , and turned around .
`` I do n't know , Mr. Brenner---person%1:03:00:: '' , he said haltingly , beginning to get an inkling---inkling%1:09:00:: of Brenner---person%1:03:00:: 's plans---plan%1:09:00:: .
`` It does n't seem quite right , telling her a thing---thing%1:10:00:: like that .
Could n't I just '' - His voice---voice%1:07:00:: trailed off into silence---silence%1:07:00:: .
Brenner---person%1:03:00:: continued to smile , but his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: were cold .
He turned and looked around at the lobby---lobby%1:06:00:: as though seeing things---thing%1:06:00:: he had n't before noticed .
`` You know , Summers---person%1:03:00:: '' , he said thoughtfully .
`` Eagle---location%1:03:00:: 's Nest---location%1:03:00:: ought to have a fire company---fire_company%1:14:00:: .
If someone were to drop a match---match%1:06:02:: in here , this place---place%1:15:04:: would go up like a haystack---haystack%1:14:00:: '' .
He started toward the stairway---stairway%1:06:00:: , then turned to add , `` Tell her to come to Adams---person%1:03:00:: 's room---room%1:06:00:: , that Adams---person%1:03:00:: is in trouble .
`` Yes sir---sir%1:18:00:: '' .
His face---face%1:08:00:: pale , Summers---person%1:03:00:: headed for the street---street%1:06:00:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: 's visit---visit%1:04:02:: to the livery stable---livery_stable%1:06:00:: had been merely a precaution---precaution%1:07:00:: in case anyone should be watching .
He paused only long enough to ascertain that Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's buckskin---buckskin%1:05:00:: was still missing and that his own gray---gray%1:05:00:: was all right , then climbed through a back window---window%1:06:00:: and dropped to the ground---ground%1:17:00:: outside .
The fact---fact%1:09:01:: that Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's horse---horse%1:05:00:: had not been returned to its stall---stall%1:06:03:: could indicate that Diane---person%1:03:00:: 's information---information%1:10:00:: had been wrong , but Curt---person%1:03:00:: did n't interpret it this way---way%1:07:01:: .
A man---man%1:18:00:: like Jess---person%1:03:00:: would want to have a ready means---means%1:04:00:: of escape---escape%1:04:00:: in case it was needed .
Probably his horse---horse%1:05:00:: would be close to where he was hiding .
From the back---back%1:15:02:: of the barn---barn%1:06:00:: it was a simple matter---matter%1:09:01:: to reach Black---person%1:03:00:: 's house---house%1:06:00:: without using the street---street%1:06:00:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: approached the place---place%1:15:04:: cautiously , and watched it several minutes---minute%1:28:00:: from the protection---protection%1:06:00:: of a grove---grove%1:14:00:: of trees---tree%1:20:00:: .
There was a light---light%1:06:00:: in Black---person%1:03:00:: 's front room---front_room%1:06:00:: , but drawn curtains---curtain%1:06:00:: prevented any view---view%1:04:00:: of the interior---interior%1:15:01:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: circled the house---house%1:06:00:: and located a barn---barn%1:06:00:: out back .
He could hear horses---horse%1:05:00:: moving around inside , and nothing else .
There was no lock---lock%1:06:00:: on the door---door%1:06:00:: , only an iron---iron%1:27:00:: hook---hook%1:06:03:: which he unfastened .
He opened the door---door%1:06:00:: and went in , pulling it shut behind him .
Again he stood in the darkness---darkness%1:15:00:: listening , but there was only the scrape---scrape%1:11:00:: of a shod hoof---hoof%1:05:00:: on a plank---plank%1:27:00:: floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
He moved ahead carefully , his left hand---left_hand%1:08:00:: in front of him , and came to a wooden partition---partition%1:06:00:: .
Horse---horse%1:05:00:: smell---smell%1:07:00:: was very strong , and he could hear the crunch---crunch%1:11:00:: of grain---grain%1:13:00:: being ground between strong jaws---jaw%1:08:00:: .
He found a match---match%1:06:00:: in his pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: and lit it .
There were two horses---horse%1:05:00:: in the barn---barn%1:06:00:: , a sway-backed dun---dun%1:05:00:: and Jess Crouch---person%1:03:00:: 's buckskin---buckskin%1:05:00:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: snuffed out the match---match%1:06:00:: .
It was certain now that Jess---person%1:03:00:: was in the house---house%1:06:00:: , but also , presumably , was Stacey Black---person%1:03:00:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: wanted to get Jess---person%1:03:00:: alone , without interference---interference%1:04:00:: from anyone , even as spineless a person---person%1:03:00:: as the store---store%1:06:00:: owner---owner%1:18:00:: .
He studied the problem---problem%1:26:00:: for a few seconds---second%1:28:00:: and thought of a means---means%1:04:00:: by which it might be solved .
Reaching across the side---side%1:15:02:: of the stall---stall%1:06:03:: , he slapped the buckskin---buckskin%1:05:00:: on the rump---rump%1:05:00:: .
The startled animal---animal%1:03:00:: let out a terrified squeal---squeal%1:11:00:: and thrashed around in the stall---stall%1:06:03:: .
As Curt---person%1:03:00:: had hoped , the house---house%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:00:: banged open .
He slapped the buckskin---buckskin%1:05:00:: again and it kicked wildly , its hoofs---hoof%1:05:00:: rattling the side---side%1:15:02:: of the stall---stall%1:06:03:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: moved over beside the door---door%1:06:00:: and waited .
Presently he heard footsteps---footstep%1:11:00:: crossing the yard---yard%1:06:02:: , and Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's smothered curses---curse%1:10:00:: .
The door---door%1:06:00:: swung open , and Jess---person%1:03:00:: said sourly , `` What the hell 's the matter with you ? ''
The horse---horse%1:05:00:: continued to snort .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: doubted that any animal---animal%1:03:00:: belonging to Jess---person%1:03:00:: would find much reassurance---reassurance%1:04:00:: in its owner---owner%1:18:02:: 's voice---voice%1:07:00:: .
Jess---person%1:03:00:: cursed again , and entered the barn---barn%1:06:00:: .
A match---match%1:06:00:: flared , and he reached above his head---head%1:08:00:: to light a lantern---lantern%1:06:00:: which hung from a wire---wire%1:06:00:: loop---loop%1:06:01:: .
As he crossed to the side---side%1:15:02:: of the stall---stall%1:06:03:: , Curt---person%1:03:00:: drew his gun---gun%1:06:00:: and clicked back the hammer---hammer%1:06:04:: .
`` Remember what happened to Gruller---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Jess---person%1:03:00:: caught his breath---breath%1:27:00:: in surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: .
He started to reach for his gun---gun%1:06:00:: , but apparently hammer it .
`` That 's the stuff---stuff%1:07:00:: '' , Curt---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Just hold it that way---way%1:07:01:: '' .
He reached out to pull the door---door%1:06:00:: shut and fasten it with a sliding bolt---bolt%1:06:01:: .
`` You and I have a little---little%1:23:00:: talking---talk%1:10:00:: to do , Jess---person%1:03:00:: .
He moved up and lifted Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: out of its holster---holster%1:06:00:: .
`` Damn you , Adams---person%1:03:00:: '' - Jess---person%1:03:00:: was beginning to recover from his initial shock---shock%1:12:01:: .
If I do n't come back in the house---house%1:06:00:: , Breed---person%1:03:00:: 's going to '' -
`` Your trigger-happy brother---brother%1:18:00:: is n't in the house---house%1:06:00:: .
About now he 's probably having supper---supper%1:13:00:: .
That long ride---ride%1:04:00:: the four of you took must 've given him a good appetite---appetite%1:12:00:: .
Now turn around so I can see your face---face%1:08:00:: '' .
Jess---person%1:03:00:: turned .
There was raw fury---fury%1:12:00:: in his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , and the veins---vein%1:08:00:: of his neck---neck%1:08:00:: were swollen .
`` You 're about as dumb as they come , Adams---person%1:03:00:: .
I do n't know what you 're up to , but when Brenner---person%1:03:00:: '' -
`` You can forget about Brenner---person%1:03:00:: , too '' , Curt---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` It 's Ben Arbuckle---person%1:03:00:: we 're going to talk about '' .
`` Arbuckle---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Jess---person%1:03:00:: stiffened .
I suppose you do n't know anything about a piece---piece%1:17:00:: of two-by-four---two-by-four%1:06:00:: , either ; one with blood all over it , Arbuckle---person%1:03:00:: 's blood---blood%1:08:00:: '' .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: 's fingers---finger%1:08:00:: put a little more pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: on the trigger---trigger%1:06:00:: of his gun---gun%1:06:00:: .
`` So help me , Crouch---person%1:03:00:: , I 'd like to kill you where you stand , but , before I do , I 'm going to hear you admit killing him .
Was it Dutch Brenner---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Curt---person%1:03:00:: was holding Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's gun---gun%1:06:00:: in his left hand---left_hand%1:08:00:: .
He drew back his arm---arm%1:08:00:: to slash the gunbarrel---gun_barrel%1:06:00:: across Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's face---face%1:08:00:: , but did n't finish the motion---motion%1:04:00:: .
Pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: whipping---whipping%1:04:00:: an unarmed man---man%1:18:00:: might come easy to someone like Jess---person%1:03:00:: , but Curt---person%1:03:00:: could n't bring himself to do it .
Apparently sensing this , and realizing that it gave him an advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: , Jess---person%1:03:00:: became bold .
`` Having all the guns---gun%1:06:00:: makes you a big man---man%1:18:00:: , do n't it , Adams---person%1:03:00:: ?
Curt---person%1:03:00:: reached out and dropped Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: back into the holster---holster%1:06:00:: .
He retreated a step---step%1:23:00:: and holstered his own .
`` All right , Crouch---crouch%1:04:00:: ; we 're on even terms---terms%1:26:00:: .
Sweat---sweat%1:08:00:: bubbled out on Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's swarthy face---face%1:08:00:: .
The fingers---finger%1:08:00:: of his right hand---right_hand%1:08:00:: twisted into a claw---claw%1:06:00:: , but he did n't reach for the gun---gun%1:06:00:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: , angry enough to be a little reckless , raised his hands---hand%1:08:00:: shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: high .
`` Does this make it any easier , coward---coward%1:18:00:: '' ?
`` I ai n't drawin ' against you '' , Jess---person%1:03:00:: said thickly .
`` I heard how you outdrew Chico---person%1:03:00:: .
I ai n't a gunslinger---gunslinger%1:18:00:: '' .
`` No---no%1:10:00:: .
You 're the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: who sneaks up on a man---man%1:18:00:: from behind and hits---hit%1:04:00:: him with a club---club%1:06:00:: .
Jess---person%1:03:00:: stared at him without answering and let his hands---hand%1:08:00:: fall to his sides---side%1:08:00:: .
He had found Curt---person%1:03:00:: 's weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: , or what to Jess---person%1:03:00:: was a weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: , and was smart enough to take advantage of it .
Somewhere in the distance---distance%1:15:00:: , a woman---woman%1:18:00:: screamed .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: was too involved in his own problems---problem%1:26:00:: to pay much attention---attention%1:09:00:: .
He had to make Jess---person%1:03:00:: talk , and he had to do it before Stacey Black---person%1:03:00:: got curious and came to investigate .
Once more he lifted Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's gun---gun%1:06:00:: from its holster---holster%1:06:00:: , only this time---time%1:11:00:: he tossed it into the stall---stall%1:06:03:: with the frightened buckskin---buckskin%1:05:00:: .
`` We 'll do it another way---way%1:07:01:: , then '' , he said harshly .
Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's coarse features---feature%1:08:00:: twisted in a surprised grin---grin%1:10:00:: which was smashed out of shape---shape%1:03:00:: by Curt---person%1:03:00:: 's fist---fist%1:08:00:: .
With a roar---roar%1:10:00:: of pain---pain%1:26:00:: and fury---fury%1:12:00:: Jess---person%1:03:00:: made his attack---attack%1:04:02:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: managed to duck beneath the man---man%1:18:00:: 's flailing fist---fist%1:08:00:: , and drove home a solid left---left%1:08:00:: to Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's mid section---midsection%1:08:00:: .
It was like hitting a sack---sack%1:06:00:: of salt---salt%1:13:00:: .
Pain---pain%1:26:00:: shout up Curt---person%1:03:00:: 's arm---arm%1:08:00:: clear to the shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: , but Jess---person%1:03:00:: seemed hardly aware that he had been hit .
He slammed into the wall---wall%1:06:00:: , bounced back , and caught Curt---person%1:03:00:: with a roundhouse---roundhouse%1:04:00:: right---right%1:08:00:: which sent him spinning .
An inch---inch%1:23:00:: lower and it would have knocked him out .
As it was , his vision---vision%1:09:01:: blurred and for a moment---moment%1:28:00:: he was unable to move .
When his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: began to focus , he saw Jess---person%1:03:00:: charging at him with a pitchfork---pitchfork%1:06:00:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: twisted to one side---side%1:15:02:: , and the tines---tine%1:06:00:: of the fork---fork%1:06:02:: bit into the floor---floor%1:17:01:: .
Jess---person%1:03:00:: wasted a few seconds---second%1:28:00:: trying to yank them loose .
It gave Curt---person%1:03:00:: time---time%1:28:05:: to stagger to his feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
The tines---tine%1:06:00:: broke off under Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's twisting---twisting%1:04:00:: , and he swung the handle---handle%1:06:00:: in an attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to knock Curt---person%1:03:00:: 's brains---brain%1:08:00:: out .
His aim---aim%1:04:00:: was hurried ; so the pitchfork---pitchfork%1:06:00:: whistled over Curt---person%1:03:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: .
By now Curt---person%1:03:00:: was seeing clearly again .
He stepped inside Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's guard---guard%1:07:00:: and landed two blows---blow%1:04:01:: to the big man---man%1:18:00:: 's belly---belly%1:08:00:: , putting everything he had behind them .
They made Jess---person%1:03:00:: double over .
When his head---head%1:08:00:: came down , Curt---person%1:03:00:: grabbed him by the hair---hair%1:08:00:: and catapulted him head---head%1:08:00:: first into the wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
The building---building%1:06:00:: shook , setting the lantern---lantern%1:06:00:: to swaying , and the buckskin---buckskin%1:05:00:: to pitching again .
Even Black---person%1:03:00:: 's old crowbait---crowbait%1:05:00:: began to snort , and from the house---house%1:06:00:: Black---person%1:03:00:: yelled , `` Jess---person%1:03:00:: !
Jess---person%1:03:00:: did n't seem too sure himself .
He lurched drunkenly to his feet---foot%1:08:01:: , lowered his head---head%1:08:00:: , and took one step---step%1:04:00:: away from the wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: caught him flush on the nose---nose%1:08:00:: with a blow---blow%1:04:01:: which started at the floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
Jess---person%1:03:00:: had had enough .
Blood---blood%1:08:00:: gushed from his nose---nose%1:08:00:: , and he backed off as rapidly as he could , stumbling over his own feet---foot%1:08:01:: in his frantic haste---haste%1:04:00:: to get away from Curt---person%1:03:00:: 's fists---fist%1:08:00:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: was in almost as bad shape---shape%1:26:00:: , but he would n't quit .
He backed Jess---person%1:03:00:: into a corner---corner%1:06:02:: , grabbed a handful---handful%1:23:00:: of the man---man%1:18:00:: 's shirtfront---shirtfront%1:06:01:: , and drew back his right fist---fist%1:08:00:: .
`` Tell me about Arbuckle---person%1:03:00:: !
`` It was Brenner---person%1:03:00:: 's idea---idea%1:09:01:: '' , Jess---person%1:03:00:: mumbled , dabbing at his nose---nose%1:08:00:: .
`` He found out about you and Arbuckle---person%1:03:00:: talking .
He wanted to show the town---town%1:14:00:: what happened to anyone who tried to start trouble---trouble%1:11:00:: '' .
`` You mean anyone who stood up for his rights---right%1:07:00:: '' , Curt---person%1:03:00:: said .
He let go of the shirt---shirt%1:06:00:: , and Jess---person%1:03:00:: slumped to the floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
Turning his back---back%1:08:00:: , Curt---person%1:03:00:: crossed to the stall---stall%1:06:03:: , reached over to untie the buckskin---buckskin%1:05:00:: 's halter---halter%1:06:01:: rope---rope%1:06:00:: , and waved his hand---hand%1:08:00:: in the animal---animal%1:03:00:: 's face---face%1:08:01:: .
The buckskin---buckskin%1:05:00:: bolted out of the stall---stall%1:06:03:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: moved in and picked up his gun---gun%1:06:00:: .
He shook loose straw---straw%1:27:01:: out of the action---action%1:06:00:: , and placed the gun---gun%1:06:00:: in his holster---holster%1:06:00:: .
Leaving Jess---person%1:03:00:: 's where it lay , he left the stall---stall%1:06:03:: .
`` Get up , Crouch---person%1:03:00:: .
Jess---person%1:03:00:: painfully got to his feet---foot%1:08:01:: as someone rattled the door---door%1:06:00:: .
Black---person%1:03:00:: called fearfully .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: opened the door---door%1:06:00:: , grabbed Black---person%1:03:00:: by the shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: , and pulled him into the barn---barn%1:06:00:: .
This dirty coward---coward%1:18:00:: just admitted killing Arbuckle---person%1:03:00:: .
He shoved Black---person%1:03:00:: toward the stall---stall%1:06:03:: , and pointed his pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: at Jess---person%1:03:00:: .
You 're coming along peacefully , or I 'll put a bullet---bullet%1:06:00:: in your leg---leg%1:08:01:: '' .
Jess---person%1:03:00:: stumbled through the door---door%1:06:01:: .
Curt---person%1:03:00:: followed , reaching behind him to shut the door---door%1:06:00:: and hook it .
Black---person%1:03:00:: would have little trouble---trouble%1:04:02:: getting out , but it might delay him a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
Jess---person%1:03:00:: asked worriedly .
`` We 're going to Marshal Woods---person%1:03:00:: 's house---house%1:06:00:: .
Maybe if the marshal---marshal%1:18:00:: hears this himself , it 'll make a difference---difference%1:24:00:: .
Somebody in this town---town%1:14:00:: must still have some backbone---backbone%1:07:00:: '' .
Be it enacted by the Senate---senate%1:14:01:: and House of Representatives---house_of_representatives%1:14:00:: of the United States of America---united_states_of_america%1:15:00:: in Congress---congress%1:14:01:: assembled , That the Act---act%1:10:01:: of July---july%1:28:00:: 3 , 1952 ( 66 Stat. 328 ) as amended ( 42 U.

`` Not since last night---night%1:28:00:: .
I did n't think there was any reason---reason%1:16:00:: to '' .
Try talking to some of the fellows---fellow%1:18:00:: he works with , friends---friend%1:18:00:: , anyone .
Try to find out how happy he is with his wife---wife%1:18:00:: , whether he plays around with women---woman%1:18:00:: .
You might try looking into his wife---wife%1:18:00:: too .
She might have been talking to some of her friends---friend%1:18:00:: about her husband---husband%1:18:00:: if they 've been having any trouble '' .
`` You think Black---person%1:03:00:: 's the one we 're looking for '' ?
I think he might be '' , Conrad---person%1:03:00:: said grimly .
`` What a stinking world '' , Rourke---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Black---person%1:03:00:: is Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: 's best friend---best_friend%1:18:00:: '' .
I 'm on my way to see the Jacobs---person%1:03:00:: woman---woman%1:18:00:: '' .
`` Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: 's secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: ?

I just do n't want to go off half cocked before picking up Black---person%1:03:00:: , that 's all '' .
Conrad---person%1:03:00:: interrupted .
`` Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: says he was in his office---office%1:06:00:: all day---day%1:28:04:: with her yesterday---yesterday%1:28:01:: .
Also , it 's just possible she might know something about Mrs. Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: '' .
I 'm telling you , if these corpses---corpse%1:08:00:: ever knew the trouble---trouble%1:04:02:: they put us to , they 'd think twice before letting themselves get knocked off '' .
`` Remember to tell that to the next corpse---corpse%1:08:00:: you meet '' .
Conrad---person%1:03:00:: hung up and sat on the small telephone-booth---telephone_booth%1:06:00:: bench---bench%1:06:00:: , massaging his right leg---leg%1:08:01:: .
He looked at his watch---watch%1:06:00:: .
It was ten minutes---minute%1:28:00:: before eleven .
He wondered how long it would be before they had a signed confession---confession%1:10:01:: from Lionel Black---person%1:03:00:: .
Thirty years---year%1:28:01:: ' experience---experience%1:09:01:: let him know , even at this early stage---stage%1:28:00:: , that Black---person%1:03:00:: was his man---man%1:18:04:: .
It was a cold , windy day---day%1:28:02:: , the day---day%1:28:02:: after Kitti---person%1:03:00:: 's death---death%1:11:00:: , but Stanley Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: paid no attention---attention%1:09:00:: to the blustery October---october%1:28:00:: wind---wind%1:19:00:: .
After leaving Conrad---person%1:03:00:: , Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: had no destination---destination%1:09:00:: .
He stopped automatically at the street corners---street_corner%1:06:00:: , waiting for the traffic lights---traffic_light%1:10:00:: to change , unheeding of other people---people%1:14:00:: , his coat---coat%1:06:00:: open and flapping .
Of Kitti---person%1:03:00:: .
Mainly of what Conrad---person%1:03:00:: had tried to make him believe .
There was nothing coherent about his thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: .
It was a succession---succession%1:07:00:: of picture---picture%1:09:00:: images---image%1:09:00:: passing through his mind---mind%1:09:00:: : the same ones , different ones , in no apparent sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: , in no logical succession---succession%1:07:00:: .
The enormity---enormity%1:07:01:: of what Conrad---person%1:03:00:: had told him made it impossible for Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: to accept , with any degree---degree%1:07:00:: of realism---realism%1:26:00:: , the actuality---actuality%1:26:00:: of it .
Conrad---person%1:03:00:: 's words---words%1:10:03:: had intellectual meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: for him only .
Whoever he was and your wife---wife%1:18:00:: were intimate .
Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: remembered Conrad---person%1:03:00:: 's exact words---word%1:10:00:: .
He knew Conrad---person%1:03:00:: had told him the truth---truth%1:10:00:: .
When Kitti---person%1:03:00:: was alive - and he remembered the pressure---pressure%1:04:00:: of her hand---hand%1:08:00:: resting lightly on his arm---arm%1:08:00:: - she had been the center---center%1:09:01:: of his life---life%1:26:02:: .
She was the sun---sun%1:18:00:: , he the closest planet---planet%1:18:00:: orbiting around her , the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the world---world%1:17:01:: existing and visible yet removed .
For fifty-five years---year%1:28:01:: he had lived , progressing towards a no-goal---no-goal%1:09:00:: , eating , working , breathing without plan---plan%1:09:00:: , without reason---reason%1:16:00:: .
Kitti---person%1:03:00:: had come along to justify everything .
She was his goal---goal%1:09:00:: , she was his reason---reason%1:16:00:: .
He had lived all his life---life%1:28:01:: waiting for her .
Not once , in the time---time%1:28:05:: that he had known her , had he ever considered the possibility---possibility%1:09:00:: , not once , not for one one-thousandth---one-thousandth%1:23:00:: of a second---second%1:28:00:: , of her infidelity---infidelity%1:07:00:: .
The walk---walk%1:04:03:: ended , inevitably , right in front of his hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: building---building%1:06:00:: .
The doorman---doorman%1:18:00:: began to nod his head---head%1:08:00:: automatically , then remembered who Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: was , what had happened to him the night---night%1:28:00:: before .
He looked at Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: with undisguised curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: .
Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: passed by him without seeing him .
He crossed the lobby---lobby%1:06:00:: and rode up in the elevator---elevator%1:06:00:: lost in his own thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: .
In the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: itself , all was still .
The police---police%1:14:00:: were no longer there .
There was no evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that anything was different than it had been .
There was no evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: that anything was different than it had been .
Except that Kitti---person%1:03:00:: was n't there .
Without taking off his coat---coat%1:06:00:: , he sat in the blue chair---chair%1:06:00:: which still faced the closed bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:00:: .
At last , sitting there , in the familiar surroundings---surroundings%1:26:00:: , the truth---truth%1:09:00:: began to sink in .
He felt no anger---anger%1:12:00:: towards Kitti---person%1:03:00:: , no sense---sense%1:09:05:: that she had betrayed him .
Where there is a left-hand entry---entry%1:21:00:: in the ledger---ledger%1:21:00:: , there is a right-hand one , he remembered from his school days---schooldays%1:28:00:: .
Where there is a victim---victim%1:18:00:: , there is a killer---killer%1:18:00:: .
Whoever he was and your wife---wife%1:18:00:: were intimate .
He rose from the chair---chair%1:06:00:: , took off his coat---coat%1:06:00:: .
Quickly , he went into the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: .
The bed---bed%1:06:00:: still showed signs---sign%1:10:05:: of where Kitti---person%1:03:00:: had lain .
Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: stood there for a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: .
He looked at the bed---bed%1:06:00:: unblinkingly .
The bed---bed%1:06:00:: was empty now .
Kitti---person%1:03:00:: would lie in it no more .
Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: wondered whether Kitti---person%1:03:00:: had lain in that same bed---bed%1:06:00:: with & & & Who ?
For thirty minutes---minute%1:28:00:: , Stanley Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: stood there .
At the end---end%1:28:00:: of the half-hour---half-hour%1:28:00:: , racking his brains---brain%1:09:00:: , thinking over and over again of Kitti---person%1:03:00:: , her friends---friend%1:18:00:: , her past---past%1:28:01:: , he left the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: .
He could think of no answer---answer%1:10:02:: .
Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: put on his coat---coat%1:06:00:: again .
Before leaving , he took one last , lingering look at the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: .
In the street---street%1:06:00:: , walking as quickly as he could , Stanley Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: was a lone figure---figure%1:07:00:: .
On Blanche Jacobs---person%1:03:00:: , Kitti Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: 's death---death%1:11:00:: had a quite different effect---effect%1:19:00:: .
For Blanche---person%1:03:00:: , Kitti---person%1:03:00:: 's death---death%1:11:00:: was a source---source%1:15:00:: of guilty , but nonetheless soaring , happy hope---hope%1:12:00:: .
In Blanche---person%1:03:00:: 's defense---defense%1:10:00:: , it must be said she was unaware of the newborn hope---hope%1:12:00:: .
The figures---figure%1:23:00:: on the worksheet---worksheet%1:10:00:: paper---paper%1:27:00:: in front of her were jumping and waving around so badly it was all she could do to make them out clearly enough to copy them with the typewriter---typewriter%1:06:00:: .
She wondered whether Stanley---person%1:03:00:: would call .
She wanted to be with him , to give him the comfort---comfort%1:04:00:: and companionship---companionship%1:26:00:: she knew he needed .
She had skipped her lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: hour---hour%1:28:00:: in the fear---fear%1:12:01:: that he might call while she was out .
And now she was feeling sick , both from concern---concern%1:12:00:: about Stanley and hunger .
And now she was feeling sick , both from concern---concern%1:12:01:: about Stanley---person%1:03:00:: and hunger---hunger%1:26:00:: .
Men---man%1:18:00:: , she reflected , even men---man%1:18:00:: like Stanley---person%1:03:00:: , are unpredictable .
She tried to think of his unpredictable actions---action%1:04:02:: in the eleven years---year%1:28:01:: she had known him and discovered they were n't so many after all .
Stanley---person%1:03:00:: really was quite predictable .
That was one of the things---thing%1:07:00:: she liked about Stanley---person%1:03:00:: .
He was n't like so many other men---man%1:18:00:: .
The dentist---dentist%1:18:00:: last night---night%1:28:00:: , for instance .
Dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: and the movies---movie%1:10:00:: had been fine .
He had taken her upstairs to say good night---good_night%1:10:00:: .
She had invited him in for coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: .
It was in the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: , as she was watching the kettle---kettle%1:06:00:: , waiting for the water---water%1:27:00:: to boil , that he had grabbed for her .
Without warning---warning%1:10:00:: , without giving her a chance---chance%1:26:00:: to prepare for it .
From behind , he had put his arms---arm%1:08:00:: on her shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: , turned her around , and pressed her to him , so close she could n't breathe .
Later , she apologized for the long scratch---scratch%1:26:00:: across his face---face%1:08:00:: , tried to explain she could n't help herself , that the panic---panic%1:12:00:: arose in her unwanted .
Stanley---person%1:03:00:: was n't like that .
She could always predict what Stanley---person%1:03:00:: was going to do , ever since she first met him .
Except for that one morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
The morning---morning%1:28:00:: he walked in to announce to her , blushing , that he was married .
She had assumed before then that one day---day%1:28:03:: he would ask her to marry him .
Blanche---person%1:03:00:: could n't remember when she had first arrived at this conclusion---conclusion%1:09:01:: .
She thought it was sometime during the second week---week%1:28:01:: she worked for Stanley---person%1:03:00:: .
It was nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: that he said or did , but it seemed so natural to her that she should be working for him , looking forward to his eventual proposal---proposal%1:10:02:: .
She was thirty-one years---year%1:28:01:: old then .
Her mother---mother%1:18:00:: was already considerably concerned over her daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: 's future---future%1:28:00:: .
But Blanche---person%1:03:00:: had been able to maintain a serene and assured composure---composure%1:07:00:: in the face of her widowed mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's continued carping---carping%1:10:00:: , had been able to resist her urgings---urging%1:10:00:: to date anyone who offered the slightest possibility---possibility%1:09:03:: of matrimony---matrimony%1:26:00:: .
For Blanche---person%1:03:00:: , it was only a matter---matter%1:09:01:: of time---time%1:28:05:: before Stanley---person%1:03:00:: would propose .
It was to be expected that Stanley---person%1:03:00:: would be shy , slow in taking such a momentous step---step%1:04:02:: .
Stanley---person%1:03:00:: went along in life---life%1:09:00:: , she knew , convinced that he deserved the love---love%1:12:00:: and faith---faith%1:09:01:: of no woman---woman%1:18:00:: .
But one day---day%1:28:03:: , she expected , he would somehow discover , without her having to tell him , that there was such a woman---woman%1:18:00:: in the world---world%1:17:01:: ; a woman---woman%1:18:00:: who was willing to give him love---love%1:12:00:: , faith---faith%1:09:01:: , and anything else a woman---woman%1:18:00:: could give a husband---husband%1:18:00:: .
Indeed , there was a woman---woman%1:18:00:: who , unasked , had already given him love---love%1:12:00:: .
Unquestionably , Blanche---person%1:03:00:: loved Stanley---person%1:03:00:: .
And then , unexpectedly , Stanley---person%1:03:00:: made his announcement---announcement%1:10:00:: .
On that first day---day%1:28:01:: , Blanche---person%1:03:00:: literally thought she was going to die , or , at the very least , go out of her mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
It might have been easier for her if Kitti Walker---person%1:03:00:: had n't been everything that Blanche---person%1:03:00:: was not .
Kitti---person%1:03:00:: was thirty years---year%1:28:01:: younger than Stanley---person%1:03:00:: , taller than Stanley---person%1:03:00:: , prettier than Stanley---person%1:03:00:: had any right---right%1:07:00:: to hope for , much less expect .
Kitti---person%1:03:00:: could have married a score---score%1:14:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: .
There was no reason---reason%1:16:00:: for her to marry someone like Stanley Gilborn---person%1:03:00:: , there was no need---need%1:26:00:: for her to marry Stanley---person%1:03:00:: .
Kitti---person%1:03:00:: had come into the office---office%1:06:00:: , on somebody 's recommendation---recommendation%1:10:00:: , because she needed help---help%1:04:00:: in preparing her income tax return---income_tax_return%1:10:00:: .
Stanley---person%1:03:00:: had filled out the return---return%1:10:01:: and because , when he was finished , it was close to the lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: hour---hour%1:28:01:: , he had politely asked Kitti---person%1:03:00:: to join him , never expecting her to accept .
Blanche---person%1:03:00:: knew all this because the door---door%1:06:00:: to Stanley---person%1:03:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: was open and , without straining too hard , she could hear everything that was said .
Stanley---person%1:03:00:: had gone out , saying he would be back in an hour---hour%1:28:00:: .
After that day---day%1:28:03:: , Blanche---person%1:03:00:: still did n't know exactly what had happened .
There were mornings---morning%1:28:00:: when Stanley---person%1:03:00:: came in late , afternoons---afternoon%1:28:00:: when he left early , days---day%1:28:03:: when he did n't come in at all .
Blanche---person%1:03:00:: knew something must be causing Stanley---person%1:03:00:: 's new , strange behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: but she never once connected it with Kitti Walker---person%1:03:00:: .
Then , six weeks---week%1:28:00:: after the day---day%1:28:03:: Kitti---person%1:03:00:: first came into the office---office%1:06:00:: , Stanley---person%1:03:00:: announced he and Kitti---person%1:03:00:: were married .
Somehow , Blanche---person%1:03:00:: managed to cover the stunned surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: and offer her congratulations---congratulation%1:10:00:: .
That night---night%1:28:00:: the two of them left for a week---week%1:28:00:: 's honeymoon---honeymoon%1:28:00:: in Acapulco---acapulco%1:15:00:: .
While they were away Blanche---person%1:03:00:: came into the office---office%1:06:00:: every morning---morning%1:28:00:: , running things---thing%1:09:02:: as she had always run them for Stanley---person%1:03:00:: , going through the week---week%1:28:01:: in a dazed stupor---stupor%1:12:00:: , getting things---thing%1:09:02:: done automatically , out of habit---habit%1:09:00:: .
For exactly one week---week%1:28:00:: , she was able to continue in this manner---manner%1:07:02:: .
On the morning---morning%1:28:00:: of Stanley---person%1:03:00:: 's return---return%1:04:01:: , however , her strength---strength%1:07:00:: left her .
Two hours---hour%1:28:00:: of watching his serenely happy face---face%1:07:00:: , listening to his soft humming---humming%1:04:00:: as he bent over his penciled figures---figure%1:23:00:: , and Blanche---person%1:03:00:: had to leave .
She stayed away for ten days---day%1:28:00:: .
Those ten days---day%1:28:03:: were like no others that Blanche---person%1:03:00:: had known .
Mostly , she stayed in bed---bed%1:06:00:: .
She did n't tell anyone , even her mother---mother%1:18:00:: , what was wrong .
She refused to have a doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , insisting there was nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: a doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: could do for her .
Your invitation---invitation%1:10:00:: to write about Serge Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: to honor his 70 th Anniversary---anniversary%1:28:00:: for the April---april%1:28:00:: issue---issue%1:10:00:: of Sovietskaya Muzyka is accepted with pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: , because I admire the music---music%1:10:00:: of Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: ; and with sober purpose---purpose%1:07:01:: , because the development---development%1:22:02:: of Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: personifies , in many ways---way%1:07:01:: , the course---course%1:14:00:: of music---music%1:10:00:: in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics---union_of_soviet_socialist_republics%1:15:00:: .
The Serge Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: whom we knew in the United States of America---united_states_of_america%1:15:00:: was gay , witty , mercurial , full of pranks---prank%1:04:01:: and bonheur - and very capable as a professional musician---musician%1:18:00:: .
These qualities---quality%1:07:00:: endeared him to both the musicians---musician%1:18:01:: and the social economic haute monde which supported the concert---concert%1:10:00:: world---world%1:14:01:: of the post World War 1---world_war_i%1:04:00:: , era---era%1:28:00:: .
Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: 's outlook---outlook%1:09:00:: as a composer---composer%1:18:00:: pianist---pianist%1:18:00:: conductor---conductor%1:18:00:: in America---america%1:15:00:: was , indeed , brilliant .
Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: 's Classical Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work---work%1:06:00:: from a naturally gifted and well trained musician---musician%1:18:00:: still in his twenties---twenties%1:28:00:: .
To the Traditionalists---traditionalist%1:18:00:: , it was a brilliant satire---satire%1:10:00:: on modernism---modernism%1:06:00:: ; to the Neo Classicists---classicist%1:18:00:: , it was a challenge---challenge%1:26:00:: to the pre-war world .
What was it to Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: ?
A tongue-in-cheek stylization---stylization%1:04:00:: of 18 th Century---century%1:28:00:: ideas---idea%1:09:00:: ; a trial balloon---trial_balloon%1:09:00:: to test the aesthetic climate---climate%1:26:01:: of the times---times%1:28:01:: ; a brilliant piece de resistance---piece_de_resistance%1:06:00:: ?
Certainly its composer---composer%1:18:00:: was an ascending star---star%1:18:01:: on a new world horizon---horizon%1:07:00:: .
I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time when Koussevitzky---person%1:03:00:: conducted it in Paris---paris%1:15:00:: in 1927 .
All musical Paris---paris%1:15:00:: was there .
Some musicians---musician%1:18:01:: were enthusiastic , some skeptical .
I myself was one of the skeptics---skeptic%1:18:00:: ( 35 years---year%1:28:01:: ago ) .
I remember Ernest Bloch---person%1:03:00:: in the foyer---foyer%1:06:00:: , shouting in his high-pitched voice---voice%1:07:00:: : `` it may be a tour de force---tour_de_force%1:04:00:: , mais mon Dieu , can anyone take this music---music%1:10:00:: seriously '' ?
The answer---answer%1:10:01:: is , `` Yes '' !
Certainly , America---america%1:15:00:: took Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: and his Classical Symphony seriously , and with a good deal---good_deal%1:23:00:: of pleasure---pleasure%1:09:00:: .
His life-long friend---friend%1:18:00:: , Serge Koussevitzky---person%1:03:00:: , gave unreservedly of his praise---praise%1:10:00:: and brilliant performances---performance%1:10:00:: in Boston---boston%1:15:00:: , New York---new_york%1:15:01:: , and Washington---washington%1:15:01:: , D. C.---dc%1:15:00:: , to which he added broadcastings---broadcasting%1:10:01:: and recordings---recording%1:06:00:: for the whole nation---nation%1:14:01:: .
Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: was also a welcome host---host%1:14:01:: : there , in 1921 , Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: conducted the world premiere---world_premiere%1:10:00:: of the Love for Three Oranges , and played the first performance---performance%1:10:00:: of his Third Piano Concerto .
`` Uncle Sam---uncle_sam%1:18:00:: '' was , indeed , a rich uncle---uncle%1:18:01:: to Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: , in those opulent , post-war victory---victory%1:11:00:: years---year%1:28:01:: of peace---peace%1:26:00:: and prosperity---prosperity%1:26:02:: , bold speculations---speculation%1:21:00:: and extravaganzas---extravaganza%1:04:00:: , enjoyment---enjoyment%1:12:00:: and pleasure---pleasure%1:09:00:: : `` The Golden Twenties '' .
We attended the premieres---premiere%1:10:00:: of his concertos---concerto%1:10:00:: , symphonies---symphony%1:10:00:: , and suites---suite%1:10:00:: ; we studied , taught , and performed his piano sonatas---piano_sonata%1:10:00:: , chamber music---chamber_music%1:10:00:: , gavottes---gavotte%1:04:00:: , and marches ; we bought his records---record%1:06:00:: and played them in our schools---school%1:06:00:: and universities---university%1:06:00:: .
We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: had won his rights---right%1:07:00:: as a world---world%1:14:01:: citizen---citizen%1:18:00:: to the first ranks---rank%1:26:01:: of Twentieth Century---century%1:28:00:: Composers---composer%1:18:00:: .
Nevertheless , Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: was much influenced by Paris---paris%1:15:00:: during the Twenties---twenties%1:28:01:: : the Paris---paris%1:15:00:: which was the artistic center---center%1:15:01:: of the Western World---world%1:17:00:: - the social Paris---paris%1:15:00:: to which Russian---russian%1:18:00:: aristocracy---aristocracy%1:14:01:: migrated - the chic Paris---paris%1:15:00:: which attracted the tourist---tourist%1:18:00:: dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: of rich America---america%1:15:00:: - the avant-garde Paris---paris%1:15:00:: of Diaghileff---person%1:03:00:: , Stravinsky---stravinsky%1:18:00:: , Koussevitzky---person%1:03:00:: , Cocteau---person%1:03:00:: , Picasso---picasso%1:18:00:: - the laissez-faire Paris---paris%1:15:00:: of Dadaism---dadaism%1:14:00:: and ultramodern art---art%1:06:00:: - the Paris---paris%1:15:00:: sympathique which took young composers---composer%1:18:00:: to her bosom---bosom%1:04:00:: with such quick and easy enthusiasms---enthusiasm%1:07:00:: .
So young Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: was the darling---darling%1:18:00:: of success---success%1:26:00:: :
in his motherland---motherland%1:15:00:: ; in the spacious hunting grounds---hunting_ground%1:26:00:: of `` Uncle Sam---uncle_sam%1:18:00:: '' ; in the exciting salons---salon%1:06:01:: of his lovely , brilliant Paris---paris%1:15:00:: - mistress---mistress%1:18:01:: of gaiety---gaiety%1:12:00:: - excess---excess%1:07:00:: and abandon---abandon%1:07:00:: - world---world%1:14:02:: theatre---theatre%1:06:00:: of new found freedoms---freedom%1:26:00:: in tone---tone%1:26:01:: , color---color%1:07:00:: , dance---dance%1:04:00:: , design---design%1:04:00:: , and thought---thought%1:09:02:: .
Meanwhile , three great terrible forces---force%1:18:00:: were coagulating and crystallizing .
In this world-wide conscription---conscription%1:04:00:: of men---men%1:14:00:: , minds---mind%1:18:00:: , and machines---machine%1:06:00:: , Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: was recalled to his native land---native_land%1:15:00:: .
The world---world%1:17:00:: exploded when Fascism---fascism%1:09:00:: challenged all concepts---concept%1:09:00:: of peace---peace%1:26:00:: and liberty---liberty%1:26:01:: , and the outraged , freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: loving peoples---people%1:14:00:: of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds---world%1:14:02:: combined forces---force%1:14:00:: to stamp Fascist tyranny---tyranny%1:14:00:: into cringing submission---submission%1:04:01:: .
After this holocaust---holocaust%1:04:00:: , a changing world---world%1:17:00:: occupied the minds---mind%1:09:00:: of men---man%1:18:04:: ; a world---world%1:17:00:: beset with new boundaries---boundary%1:25:00:: , new treaties---treaty%1:10:00:: and governments---government%1:14:00:: , new goals---goal%1:09:00:: and methods---method%1:09:00:: , and the age-old fears---fear%1:12:00:: of aggression---aggression%1:04:00:: and subjugation---subjugation%1:26:00:: - hunger---hunger%1:26:00:: and exposure---exposure%1:07:00:: .
In this changed world---world%1:17:00:: , Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: settled to find himself , and to create for large national purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: .
Here , this happy , roving son---son%1:18:00:: of good fortune---good_fortune%1:26:00:: proved that he could accept the disciplines---discipline%1:09:01:: of a new social economic order---order%1:26:00:: fighting for its very existence---existence%1:26:00:: and ideals---ideal%1:09:00:: in a truculent world---world%1:17:00:: .
Here , Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: became a workman---workman%1:18:00:: in the vineyards---vineyard%1:06:00:: of Socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: - producing music---music%1:10:00:: for the masses---masses%1:14:00:: .
It is at this point---point%1:28:00:: in his life---life%1:28:00:: that the mature Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: emerges .
One might have expected that such a violent epoch---epoch%1:28:00:: of transition---transition%1:04:00:: would have destroyed the creative flair---flair%1:09:00:: of a composer---composer%1:18:00:: , especially one whose works---work%1:06:00:: were so fluent and spontaneous .
But no : Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: grew .
He accepted the environment---environment%1:26:00:: of his destiny---destiny%1:11:00:: - took root and grew to fulfill the stature---stature%1:26:00:: of his early promise---promise%1:09:00:: .
By 1937 he had clarified his intentions---intention%1:09:00:: to serve his people---people%1:14:00:: : `` I have striven for clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: and melodious idiom---idiom%1:07:00:: , but at the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods---method%1:09:00:: of harmony---harmony%1:10:01:: and melody---melody%1:09:00:: .
This is precisely what makes lucid , straightforward music---music%1:10:00:: so difficult to compose - the clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: must be new , not old '' .
How right he was ; how clearly he saw the cultural defection---defection%1:04:00:: of experimentation---experimentation%1:09:00:: as an escape---escape%1:04:02:: for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline---discipline%1:09:00:: of modern traditionalism---traditionalism%1:07:00:: .
And with what resource---resource%1:07:00:: did Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: back up his Credo---credo%1:09:00:: of words---words%1:10:03:: - with torrents---torrent%1:19:01:: of powerful music---music%1:10:00:: .
Compare the vast difference---difference%1:07:00:: in scope---scope%1:07:00:: and beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony and his big , muscular , passionate , and eloquent Fifth Symphony ; or the Love for Three Oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful , imaginative , colorful , and subtle tenderness---tenderness%1:07:00:: of the magnificent ballet---ballet%1:04:00:: , The Stone Flower .
This masterpiece---masterpiece%1:04:00:: has gaiety---gaiety%1:12:00:: , too , but it is the gaiety---gaiety%1:12:00:: of dancing people---people%1:14:00:: : earthy , salty and humorous .
Of course , these works---work%1:06:00:: are not comparable , even though the same brain---brain%1:18:00:: conceived them .
The early works---work%1:06:00:: were conceived for a sophisticated , international audience---audience%1:14:00:: ; the later works---work%1:06:00:: were conceived to affirm a way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: for fellow citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: .
However , in all of Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: 's music---music%1:10:00:: , young or mature , we find his profile---profile%1:10:00:: - his `` signature---signature%1:07:00:: '' - his craftsman---craftsman%1:18:02:: 's attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: .
Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: never forsakes his medium---medium%1:10:01:: for the cause---cause%1:04:01:: of experimentation---experimentation%1:09:00:: per se .
In orchestration---orchestration%1:04:01:: , he stretches the limits---limit%1:07:00:: of instrumentation---instrumentation%1:04:00:: with good judgment---judgment%1:07:00:: and a fine imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: for color---color%1:07:02:: .
His sense---sense%1:09:06:: for rhythmic variety---variety%1:07:00:: and timing---timing%1:07:00:: is impeccable .
His creative development---development%1:04:01:: of melodic designs---design%1:09:01:: of Slavic---slavic%1:10:00:: dance---dance%1:10:00:: tunes---tune%1:10:00:: and love---love%1:12:00:: songs---song%1:10:00:: is captivating : witty , clever , adroit , and subtle .
His counterpoint---counterpoint%1:10:00:: is pertinent , skillful , and rarely thick .
Also , it should be noted that the polytonal freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: of his melodies---melody%1:10:00:: and harmonic modulations---modulation%1:10:01:: , the brilliant orchestrations---orchestration%1:10:00:: , the adroitness---adroitness%1:09:00:: for evading the heaviness---heaviness%1:07:00:: of figured bass---figured_bass%1:10:00:: , the skill---skill%1:09:01:: in florid counterpoint---counterpoint%1:10:00:: were not lost in his mature output---output%1:06:00:: , even in the spectacular historical dramas---drama%1:10:01:: of the stage---stage%1:10:00:: and cinema---cinema%1:10:00:: , where a large , dramatic canvas of sound---sound%1:09:00:: was required .
That Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: 's harmonies---harmony%1:10:01:: and forms---form%1:09:01:: sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears---ear%1:08:00:: , may or may not indicate that he was less of an `` original---original%1:09:00:: '' than we prefer to believe .
Need---need%1:03:00:: for novelty---novelty%1:09:00:: may be a symptom---symptom%1:10:00:: of cultural fatigue---fatigue%1:26:00:: and instability---instability%1:26:00:: .
Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: might well emerge as a cultural hero---hero%1:18:00:: , who , by the force---force%1:07:01:: of his creative life---life%1:26:01:: , helped preserve the main stream---stream%1:14:00:: of tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: , to which the surviving idioms---idiom%1:10:02:: of current experimentalism---experimentalism%1:09:01:: may be eventually added and integrated .
At this date---date%1:28:02:: , it seems probable that the name---name%1:10:00:: of Serge Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: will appear in the archives---archives%1:10:00:: of History---history%1:10:00:: , as an effective Traditionalist---traditionalist%1:18:00:: , who was fully aware of the lure---lure%1:07:00:: and danger---danger%1:04:00:: of experimentation---experimentation%1:09:00:: , and used it as it served his purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: ; yet was never caught up in it - never a slave---slave%1:18:00:: to its academic dialectics---dialectic%1:09:00:: .
Certainly , it is the traditional clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: of his music---music%1:10:00:: which has endeared him to the Western World---world%1:14:01:: - not his experimentations---experimentation%1:09:00:: .
So Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: was able to cultivate his musical talents---talent%1:09:00:: and harvest a rich reward---reward%1:11:00:: from them .
Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: would have done better , or even as well , under different circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: .
His fellow countryman---countryman%1:18:00:: , Igor---person%1:03:00:: Stravinsky---stravinsky%1:18:00:: , certainly did not .
Why did Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: expand in stature---stature%1:26:00:: and fecundity---fecundity%1:09:00:: , while Stravinsky---stravinsky%1:18:00:: ( who leaped into fame---fame%1:26:01:: like a young giant---giant%1:18:01:: ) dwindled in stature---stature%1:26:00:: and fruitfulness---fruitfulness%1:07:00:: ?
I think the answer---answer%1:10:02:: is to be found in Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: 's own words---words%1:10:03:: :
`` the clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: must be new , not old '' .
When Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: forged his new clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: of `` lucid , straightforward music---music%1:10:00:: , so difficult to compose '' , he shaped his talents---talent%1:09:00:: to his purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: .
When Stravinsky---stravinsky%1:18:00:: shaped his purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: to the shifting scenes---scene%1:15:00:: of many cultures---culture%1:14:00:: , many salons---salon%1:06:01:: , many dialectics---dialectic%1:09:00:: , many personalities---personality%1:07:00:: , he tried to refashion himself into a stylist---stylist%1:18:00:: of many styles---style%1:10:00:: , determined by many disparate cultures---culture%1:14:00:: .
Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: was guided in a consistent direction---direction%1:09:00:: by the life---life%1:09:00:: of his own people---people%1:14:00:: - by the compass---compass%1:07:00:: of their national ideas---idea%1:09:00:: .
But Stravinsky---person%1:03:00:: was swayed by the attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: of whatever culture---culture%1:14:00:: he was reflecting .
In all his miscalculations---miscalculation%1:04:00:: , Stravinsky---person%1:03:00:: made the fatal historical blunder---blunder%1:04:00:: of presuming that he could transform other composers---composer%1:18:00:: ' inspirations---inspiration%1:06:00:: - representing many peoples---people%1:14:00:: , time periods---time_period%1:28:00:: and styles---style%1:07:00:: - into his own music---music%1:10:00:: by warping the harmony---harmony%1:10:01:: , melody---melody%1:09:00:: , or form---form%1:09:01:: , to verify his own experiments---experiment%1:04:01:: .
Because of the authentic homogeneity---homogeneity%1:07:00:: of his early Nationalistic materials---material%1:10:00:: , and his flair---flair%1:09:00:: for orchestrations---orchestration%1:10:00:: - his brilliant Petruchka , his savage Sacre du Printemps , his incisive Les Noces - the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction---direction%1:09:00:: for which his native talents---talent%1:09:00:: were predisposed .
But time---time%1:28:05:: is running out , and many of Stravinsky---stravinsky%1:18:00:: 's admirers---admirer%1:18:01:: begin to fear that he will never find terra firma---terra_firma%1:17:00:: .
His various aesthetic postulates---postulate%1:10:00:: remain as landmarks---landmark%1:11:00:: of a house divided against itself : Supra Expressionism---supra_expressionism%1:14:00:: , Neo Paganism---paganism%1:09:00:: , Neo Classicism , Neo Romanticism---neoromanticism%1:14:00:: , Neo Jazz , Neo Ecclesiasticism---ecclesiasticism%1:04:00:: , Neo Popularism---popularism%1:10:00:: , and most recently , Post Serialism---serialism%1:10:00:: - all competing with each other within one composer---composer%1:18:00:: !
What a patchwork---patchwork%1:09:00:: of proclamations---proclamation%1:10:00:: and renunciations---renunciation%1:10:01:: !
Meager and shabby by-products---by-product%1:19:00:: linger to haunt our memories---memory%1:09:02:: of a once mighty protagonist---protagonist%1:18:00:: ; a maladroit reharmonization---reharmonization%1:10:00:: of our National Anthem---national_anthem%1:10:00:: ( The Star-Spangled Banner ) ; a poor attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to write an idiomatic jazz concerto---concerto%1:10:00:: ; a circus---circus%1:04:00:: polka---polka%1:10:00:: for elephants---elephant%1:05:00:: ; his hopes---hope%1:12:00:: that the tunes---tune%1:10:00:: from his old music---music%1:10:00:: might be used for popular American commercial songs---song%1:10:00:: !
Stravinsky---stravinsky%1:18:00:: , nearing the age---age%1:07:00:: of eighty , is like a lost and frantic bird---bird%1:05:00:: , flitting from one abandoned nest---nest%1:17:00:: to another , searching for a home---home%1:06:00:: .
How differently Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: 's life---life%1:28:00:: unfolded .
Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: was able to adjust his creative personality---personality%1:07:00:: to a swiftly changing world---world%1:17:00:: without losing his particular force---force%1:07:01:: and direction---direction%1:09:00:: .
In the process---process%1:04:00:: , his native endowments---endowment%1:09:00:: were stretched , strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: .
With a large and circumspect 20 th Century---century%1:28:00:: technique---technique%1:09:00:: , he wove the materials---material%1:27:00:: of national heroes---hero%1:18:00:: and events---event%1:03:00:: , national folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: and children---child%1:18:00:: 's fairy tales---fairytale%1:10:00:: - Slavic---slavic%1:10:00:: dances---dance%1:10:00:: and love---love%1:12:00:: songs---song%1:10:00:: - into a solid musical literature---literature%1:10:00:: which served his people---people%1:14:00:: well , and is providing much enjoyment---enjoyment%1:12:00:: to the World---world%1:17:00:: at large .
Of course , it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat---feat%1:04:00:: , Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: had the vast resources---resource%1:07:00:: of his people---people%1:14:00:: behind him ; time---time%1:28:05:: and economic security---security%1:21:01:: ; symphony orchestras---symphony_orchestra%1:14:00:: , opera---opera%1:10:00:: and ballet companies---ballet_company%1:14:00:: ; choruses---chorus%1:14:00:: , chamber music---chamber_music%1:10:00:: ensembles---ensemble%1:14:02:: ; soloists---soloist%1:18:00:: ; recordings---recording%1:06:00:: ; broadcastings---broadcasting%1:10:01:: ; television---television%1:06:00:: ; large and eager audiences---audience%1:14:00:: .
It must be conceded that his native land---native_land%1:15:00:: provided Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: with many of the necessary conditions---condition%1:26:00:: for great creative incentive---incentive%1:16:00:: :
economic security---security%1:21:01:: and cultural opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: , incisive idioms---idiom%1:10:02:: , social fermentations---fermentation%1:26:00:: for a new national ideology---ideology%1:09:01:: - a sympathetic public---public%1:14:00:: and a large body---body%1:14:00:: of performers---performer%1:18:00:: especially trained to fulfill his purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: .
Thus in Prokofieff---person%1:03:00:: the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics---union_of_soviet_socialist_republics%1:15:00:: produced one of the great composers---composer%1:18:00:: of the Twentieth Century---century%1:28:00:: .
That his moods---mood%1:12:00:: , even in his early years---year%1:28:01:: , are those of his people---people%1:14:00:: , does him honor---honor%1:10:00:: , as his music---music%1:10:00:: honors those who inspired it .
That he mastered every aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: of his medium---medium%1:10:01:: according to his own great talents---talent%1:09:00:: and contemporary judgments---judgment%1:09:04:: , is a good and solid symbol---symbol%1:10:00:: of his people---people%1:14:00:: under the tremendous pressures---pressure%1:07:00:: of proclaiming and practising the rigors---rigor%1:07:00:: of a new culture---culture%1:14:00:: ; and perhaps of even greater significance---significance%1:07:00:: - his music---music%1:10:00:: is strong 20 th Century---century%1:28:00:: evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: of the effectiveness---effectiveness%1:07:00:: of Evolution---evolution%1:22:01:: , based on a broad Traditionalism---traditionalism%1:04:00:: for the creative art---art%1:06:00:: of music---music%1:10:00:: .
April---april%1:28:00:: 10 marked a memorable date---date%1:28:00:: in New York---new_york%1:15:01:: 's musical history---history%1:28:00:: - indeed in the musical history---history%1:28:00:: of the entire eastern United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
On that date---date%1:28:00:: the Musicians Emergency Fund---group%1:03:00:: , organized to furnish employment---employment%1:04:02:: for musicians---musician%1:18:01:: unable to obtain engagements---engagement%1:04:05:: during the depression---great_depression%1:26:00:: and to provide relief---relief%1:04:00:: for older musicians---musician%1:18:01:: who lost their fortunes---fortune%1:21:00:: in the stock market---stock_market%1:06:00:: crash---crash%1:11:02:: , observed its 30 th anniversary---anniversary%1:28:00:: .
In a few school---school%1:14:00:: districts---district%1:15:00:: one finds a link---link%1:24:00:: between school---school%1:14:00:: and job---job%1:04:00:: .
In those vocational programs---vocational_program%1:09:00:: organized with Smith-Hughes---group%1:03:00:: money---money%1:21:00:: , there may be a close tie---tie%1:26:00:: between the labor union---labor_union%1:14:00:: and a local employer---employer%1:18:00:: on the one hand and the vocational teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: on the other .
In these cases---case%1:26:00:: a graduate---graduate%1:18:00:: may enter directly into an apprentice---apprentice%1:18:00:: program---program%1:09:01:: , saving a year---year%1:28:01:: because of his vocational courses---course%1:04:01:: in grades---grade%1:14:00:: 11 and 12 .
The apprentice---apprentice%1:18:00:: program---program%1:09:01:: will involve further education---education%1:04:00:: on a part-time basis---basis%1:24:00:: , usually at night---night%1:28:00:: , perhaps using some of the same equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: of the high school---high_school%1:14:00:: .
These opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: are to be found in certain cities---city%1:15:00:: in such crafts---craft%1:04:00:: as auto mechanics---auto_mechanics%1:04:00:: , carpentry---carpentry%1:04:00:: , drafting---drafting%1:04:02:: , electrical work---electrical_work%1:04:00:: , tool-and-die work---tool-and-die_work%1:04:00:: , and sheet-metal---sheet_metal%1:06:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: .
Formally organized vocational programs---vocational_program%1:09:00:: supported by federal funds---funds%1:21:00:: allow high school---high_school%1:14:00:: students---student%1:18:00:: to gain experience---experience%1:09:01:: in a field---field%1:04:00:: of work---work%1:04:01:: which is likely to lead to a full-time job---job%1:04:00:: on graduation---graduation%1:04:01:: .
The `` diversified occupations---occupation%1:04:00:: '' program---program%1:09:01:: is a part-time trade---trade%1:04:00:: preparatory program---program%1:09:01:: conducted over two school years---school_year%1:28:00:: on a cooperative basis---basis%1:24:00:: between the school---school%1:14:00:: and local industrial and business employers---employer%1:18:00:: .
The `` distributive education---education%1:04:00:: '' program---program%1:09:01:: operates in a similar way , with arrangements---arrangement%1:09:01:: between the school---school%1:14:00:: and employers---employer%1:18:00:: in merchandising---merchandising%1:04:00:: fields---field%1:04:00:: .
In both cases---case%1:11:00:: the student---student%1:18:00:: attends school---school%1:14:00:: half-time and works in a regular job---job%1:04:00:: the other half---half%1:23:00:: .
He receives remuneration---remuneration%1:21:00:: for his work---work%1:04:00:: .
In a few places---place%1:15:01:: cooperative programs---program%1:09:01:: between schools---school%1:14:00:: and employers---employer%1:18:00:: in clerical work---work%1:04:01:: have shown the same possibilities---possibility%1:09:03:: for allowing the student---student%1:18:00:: , while still in school---school%1:14:00:: , to develop skills---skill%1:09:01:: which are immediately marketable upon graduation---graduation%1:04:01:: .
Adult education---adult_education%1:04:00:: courses---course%1:04:01:: , work-study programs---work-study_program%1:04:00:: of various sorts---sort%1:09:00:: - these are all evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: of a continuing interest---interest%1:09:00:: of the schools---school%1:14:00:: in furthering educational opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: for out-of-school youth---youth%1:14:00:: .
In general , however , it may be said that when a boy---boy%1:18:00:: or a girl---girl%1:18:02:: leaves the high school---high_school%1:14:00:: , the school---school%1:14:00:: authorities---authority%1:18:01:: play little or no part---part%1:04:01:: in the decision---decision%1:09:00:: of what happens next .
If the student---student%1:18:00:: drops out of high school---high_school%1:14:00:: , the break---break%1:11:03:: with the school---school%1:14:00:: is even more complete .
When there is employment---employment%1:26:00:: opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: for youth---youth%1:14:00:: , this arrangement---arrangement%1:09:01:: - or lack---lack%1:26:00:: of arrangement---arrangement%1:09:01:: - works out quite well .
Indeed , in some periods---period%1:28:00:: of our history---history%1:28:00:: and in some neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:15:00:: the job---job%1:04:00:: opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys---boy%1:18:00:: who were potential members---member%1:18:00:: of the professions---profession%1:14:00:: quit school---school%1:14:00:: at an early age---age%1:28:00:: and went to work .
Statistically this has represented a loss---loss%1:21:01:: to the nation---nation%1:14:01:: , although one must admit that in an individual case---case%1:11:00:: the decision---decision%1:04:00:: in retrospect---retrospect%1:09:00:: may have been a wise one .
I make no attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to measure the enduring satisfaction---satisfaction%1:26:00:: and material well-being---well-being%1:26:00:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: who went to work on graduation---graduation%1:04:01:: from high school---high_school%1:14:00:: and was highly successful in the business---business%1:04:00:: which he entered .
He may or may not be `` better off '' than his classmate---classmate%1:18:00:: who went on to a college---college%1:14:00:: and professional school---school%1:14:00:: .
But in the next decades---decade%1:28:00:: the nation---nation%1:14:01:: needs to educate for the professions---profession%1:14:00:: all the potential professional talent---talent%1:18:00:: .
In a later chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: dealing with the suburban school---school%1:14:00:: , I shall discuss the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of arranging a program---program%1:09:01:: for the academically talented and highly gifted youth---youth%1:14:00:: in any high school---high_school%1:14:00:: where he is found .
In the Negro---negro%1:18:00:: neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:15:00:: and also to some extent---extent%1:26:00:: in the mixed neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:15:00:: the problem---problem%1:26:00:: may be one of identification and motivation---motivation%1:03:00:: .
High motivation---motivation%1:03:00:: towards higher education---higher_education%1:04:00:: must start early enough so that by the time---time%1:11:00:: the boy---boy%1:18:00:: or girl---girl%1:18:02:: reaches grade---grade%1:14:00:: 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills---skill%1:09:01:: which are essential for academic work---work%1:09:00:: .
Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades---grade%1:14:00:: in this regard---regard%1:09:00:: in the Negro schools---school%1:14:00:: .
However , the teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: can only go so far if the attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of the community---community%1:14:00:: and the family---family%1:18:00:: is anti-intellectual .
And the fact---fact%1:09:01:: remains that there are today---today%1:28:00:: few shining examples---example%1:09:01:: of Negroes---negro%1:18:00:: in positions---position%1:26:00:: of intellectual leadership---leadership%1:26:00:: .
This is not due to any policy---policy%1:09:00:: of discrimination---discrimination%1:04:00:: on the part of the Northern universities---university%1:14:00:: .
Quite the contrary---contrary%1:24:01:: , as I can testify from personal experience---experience%1:09:01:: as a former university---university%1:14:00:: president---president%1:18:02:: .
Rather we see here another vicious circle---vicious_circle%1:22:00:: .
The absence---absence%1:26:00:: of successful Negroes---negro%1:18:00:: in the world---world%1:14:01:: of scholarship---scholarship%1:09:00:: and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm---enthusiasm%1:09:00:: among Negro---negro%1:18:00:: youth---youth%1:14:00:: for academic careers---career%1:04:00:: .
I believe the situation---situation%1:26:01:: is improving , but the success---success%1:04:00:: stories---story%1:10:03:: need to be heavily publicized .
Here again we run into the roadblock---roadblock%1:09:00:: that Negroes---negro%1:18:00:: do not like to be designated as Negroes---negro%1:18:00:: in the press---press%1:10:00:: .
How can the vicious circle---vicious_circle%1:22:00:: be broken ?
This is a problem---problem%1:26:00:: to which leaders---leader%1:18:00:: of opinion---opinion%1:09:01:: , both Negro---negro%1:18:00:: and white---white%1:18:00:: , should devote far more attention---attention%1:04:01:: .
It is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: to break down barriers---barrier%1:09:00:: of inequality---inequality%1:07:00:: in the South---south%1:15:01:: .
I should like to underline four points---point%1:09:01:: I made in my first report---report%1:10:03:: with respect to vocational education---education%1:04:00:: .
First and foremost , vocational courses---course%1:04:01:: should not replace courses---course%1:04:01:: which are essential parts---part%1:24:00:: of the required academic program---academic_program%1:09:00:: for graduation---graduation%1:04:01:: .
Second , vocational courses---course%1:04:01:: should be provided in grades---grade%1:14:00:: 11 and 12 and not require more than half---half%1:23:00:: the student---student%1:18:00:: 's time---time%1:28:05:: in those years---year%1:28:01:: ; however , for slow learners---learner%1:18:00:: and prospective dropouts---dropout%1:18:00:: these courses---course%1:04:01:: ought to begin earlier .
Third , the significance---significance%1:07:00:: of the vocational courses---course%1:04:01:: is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work---work%1:09:00:: ; they realize the relevance---relevance%1:24:00:: of what they are learning to their future careers---career%1:04:00:: , and this sense---sense%1:09:05:: of purpose---purpose%1:07:01:: is carried over to the academic courses---course%1:04:01:: which they are studying at the same time .
Fourth , the type---type%1:09:00:: of vocational training programs---training_program%1:09:00:: should be related to the employment---employment%1:04:00:: opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: in the general locality---locality%1:15:00:: .
This last point---point%1:09:01:: is important because if high school---high_school%1:14:00:: pupils---pupil%1:18:00:: are aware that few , if any , graduates---graduate%1:18:00:: who have chosen a certain vocational program---vocational_program%1:09:00:: have obtained a job---job%1:04:00:: as a consequence---consequence%1:11:00:: of the training---training%1:04:00:: , the whole idea---idea%1:09:00:: of relevance---relevance%1:24:00:: disappears .
Vocational training---training%1:04:00:: which holds no hope---hope%1:09:00:: that the skill---skill%1:09:01:: developed will be in fact a marketable skill---skill%1:09:01:: becomes just another school---school%1:14:00:: `` chore---chore%1:04:00:: '' for those whose interest---interest%1:09:00:: in their studies---study%1:09:03:: has begun to falter .
Those who , because of population---population%1:14:00:: mobility---mobility%1:07:00:: and the reputed desire---desire%1:07:00:: of employers---employer%1:18:00:: to train their own employees---employee%1:18:00:: , would limit vocational education---education%1:04:00:: to general rather than specific skills---skill%1:09:01:: ought to bear in mind the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of motivation---motivation%1:03:00:: in any kind---kind%1:09:00:: of school---school%1:14:00:: experience---experience%1:09:00:: .
I have been using the word---word%1:10:00:: `` vocational '' as a layman---layman%1:18:00:: would at first sight think it should be used .
I intend to include under the term---term%1:10:00:: all the practical courses---course%1:04:01:: open to boys---boy%1:18:00:: and girls---girl%1:18:02:: .
These courses---course%1:04:01:: develop skills---skill%1:09:01:: other than those we think of when we use the adjective---adjective%1:10:00:: `` academic '' .
Practically all of these practical skills---skill%1:09:01:: are of such a nature---nature%1:07:02:: that a degree---degree%1:26:01:: of mastery---mastery%1:09:00:: can be obtained in high school---high_school%1:14:00:: sufficient to enable the youth---youth%1:18:00:: to get a job---job%1:04:00:: at once on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of the skill---skill%1:09:01:: .
They are in this sense skills---skill%1:09:01:: marketable immediately on graduation---graduation%1:04:01:: from high school---high_school%1:14:00:: .
To be sure , in tool-and-die work---tool-and-die_work%1:04:00:: and in the building---building%1:04:01:: trades---trade%1:04:00:: , the first job---job%1:04:00:: must be often on an apprentice---apprentice%1:18:00:: basis---basis%1:24:00:: , but two years---year%1:28:01:: of halftime vocational training---training%1:04:00:: enables the young man---man%1:18:00:: thus to anticipate one year---year%1:28:01:: of apprentice---apprentice%1:18:00:: status---status%1:26:00:: .
Similarly , a girl---girl%1:18:02:: who graduates with a good working knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of stenography---stenography%1:10:00:: and the use---use%1:04:00:: of clerical machines---machine%1:06:00:: and who is able to get a job---job%1:04:00:: at once may wish to improve her skill---skill%1:09:01:: and knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: by a year---year%1:28:01:: or two of further study---study%1:09:03:: in a community college---community_college%1:14:00:: or secretarial school---secretarial_school%1:14:00:: .
Of course , it can be argued that an ability---ability%1:09:00:: to write English---english%1:10:00:: correctly and with some degree---degree%1:26:01:: of elegance---elegance%1:07:00:: is a marketable skill---skill%1:09:01:: .
So , too , is the mathematical competence---competence%1:07:00:: of a college---college%1:14:00:: graduate---graduate%1:18:00:: who has majored in mathematics---mathematics%1:09:00:: .
In a sense almost all high school---high_school%1:14:00:: and college---college%1:14:00:: courses---course%1:04:01:: could be considered as vocational to the extent---extent%1:26:00:: that later in life---life%1:28:00:: the student---student%1:18:00:: in his vocation---vocation%1:04:00:: ( which may be a profession---profession%1:04:00:: ) will be called upon to use some of the skills---skill%1:09:01:: developed and the competence---competence%1:07:00:: obtained .
In spite of the shading---shading%1:04:00:: of one type---type%1:09:00:: of course---course%1:04:01:: into another , I believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses---course%1:04:01:: as apart from academic courses---course%1:04:01:: .
Perhaps a course---course%1:04:01:: in typewriting---typewriting%1:10:00:: might be regarded as the exception---exception%1:09:00:: which proves the rule---rule%1:09:01:: .
Today---today%1:28:00:: many college---college%1:14:00:: bound students---student%1:18:00:: try to take a course---course%1:04:01:: in personal typing---typing%1:10:00:: , as they feel a certain degree---degree%1:26:01:: of mastery---mastery%1:09:00:: of this skill---skill%1:09:01:: is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work---work%1:09:00:: in college---college%1:14:00:: and a professional school---school%1:14:00:: .
Most of our largest cities---city%1:15:00:: have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools---high_school%1:14:00:: .
In this respect---respect%1:09:00:: , public education---education%1:04:00:: in the large cities---city%1:15:00:: differs from education---education%1:04:00:: in the smaller cities---city%1:15:00:: and consolidated school---school%1:14:00:: districts---district%1:15:00:: .
The neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: high schools---high_school%1:14:00:: are not , strictly speaking , comprehensive schools---school%1:14:00:: , because some of the boys---boy%1:18:00:: and girls---girl%1:18:02:: may be attending a vocational or technical high school---high_school%1:14:00:: instead of the local school---school%1:14:00:: .
Indeed , one school superintendent---school_superintendent%1:18:00:: in a large city---city%1:15:00:: objects to the use---use%1:04:00:: of the term---term%1:10:00:: comprehensive high school---high_school%1:14:00:: for the senior high schools---senior_high_school%1:14:00:: in his city---city%1:15:00:: , because these schools---school%1:14:00:: do not offer strictly vocational programs---vocational_program%1:09:00:: .
He prefers to designate such schools---school%1:14:00:: as `` general '' high schools---high_school%1:14:00:: .
The suburban high school---high_school%1:14:00:: , it is worth noting , also is not a widely comprehensive high school---high_school%1:14:00:: because of the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of vocational programs---vocational_program%1:09:00:: .
The reason---reason%1:10:01:: is that there is a lack---lack%1:26:00:: of interest---interest%1:09:00:: on the part---part%1:09:02:: of the community---community%1:14:00:: .
Therefore employment---employment%1:26:00:: and education---education%1:04:00:: in all the schools---school%1:14:00:: in a metropolitan area---area%1:15:01:: are related in different ways---way%1:07:01:: from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school---high_school%1:14:00:: described in my first report---report%1:10:03:: .
The separate vocational or technical high schools---high_school%1:14:00:: in the large cities---city%1:15:00:: must be reckoned as permanent institutions---institution%1:14:00:: .
By and large their programs---program%1:09:01:: are satisfactorily connected both to the employment---employment%1:26:00:: situation---situation%1:26:00:: and to the realities---reality%1:26:01:: of the apprentice---apprentice%1:18:00:: system---system%1:09:02:: .
It is not often realized to what degree certain trades---trade%1:04:00:: are in many communities---community%1:14:00:: closed areas---area%1:26:00:: of employment---employment%1:26:00:: , except for a lucky few .
One has to talk confidentially with some of the directors---director%1:18:00:: of vocational high schools---high_school%1:14:00:: to realize that a boy---boy%1:18:00:: cannot just say , `` I want to be a plumber---plumber%1:18:00:: '' , and then , by doing good work---work%1:04:00:: , find a job---job%1:04:00:: .
It is far more difficult in many communities---community%1:14:00:: to obtain admission---admission%1:04:00:: to an apprentice---apprentice%1:18:00:: program---program%1:09:01:: which involves union---union%1:14:01:: approval---approval%1:26:00:: than to get into the most selective medical school---medical_school%1:14:00:: in the nation .
Two stories---story%1:10:03:: will illustrate what I have in mind .
One vocational instructor---instructor%1:18:00:: in a city---city%1:15:00:: vocational school---vocational_school%1:14:00:: , speaking of his course---course%1:04:01:: in a certain field---field%1:09:00:: , said he had no difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: placing all students---student%1:18:00:: in jobs---job%1:04:00:: outside of the city---city%1:15:00:: .
In the city---city%1:15:00:: , he said , the waiting list---waiting_list%1:10:00:: for those who want to join the union---union%1:14:01:: is so long that unless a boy---boy%1:18:00:: has an inside track---inside_track%1:07:00:: he can n't get in .
In a far distant part---part%1:24:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: , I was talking to an instructor---instructor%1:18:00:: about a boy---boy%1:18:00:: who in the twelfth grade---grade%1:14:00:: was doing special work---work%1:04:00:: .
`` Oh , he 'll be a plumber---plumber%1:18:00:: '' , came the answer---answer%1:10:01:: .
`` But is n't it almost impossible to get into the union---union%1:14:01:: '' ?
`` He 'll have no difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: '' , I was told .
`` He has very good connections---connection%1:18:01:: '' .
In my view---view%1:10:00:: , there should be a school---school%1:14:00:: which offers significant vocational programs---vocational_program%1:09:00:: for boys---boy%1:18:00:: within easy reach---reach%1:07:00:: of every family---family%1:14:02:: in a city---city%1:15:00:: .
Ideally these schools---school%1:14:00:: should be so located that one or more should be in the area---area%1:15:01:: where demand---demand%1:26:00:: for practical courses---course%1:04:01:: is at the highest .
An excellent example---example%1:09:01:: of a successful location---location%1:04:02:: of a new vocational high school---high_school%1:14:00:: is the Dunbar Vocational High School---group%1:03:00:: in Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: .
Located in a bad slum area---slum_area%1:15:00:: now undergoing redevelopment---redevelopment%1:04:00:: , this school---school%1:14:00:: and its program---program%1:09:01:: are especially tailored to the vocational aims---aim%1:09:01:: of its students---student%1:18:00:: .
Hardly a window---window%1:06:00:: has been broken since Dunbar---group%1:03:00:: first was opened ( and vandalism---vandalism%1:04:00:: in schools---school%1:14:00:: is a major problem---problem%1:26:00:: in many slum areas---slum_area%1:15:00:: ) .
I discovered in the course---course%1:14:00:: of a visit---visit%1:04:02:: there that almost all the pupils---pupil%1:18:00:: were Negroes---negro%1:18:00:: .
They were learning trades---trade%1:04:00:: as diverse as shoe repairing---shoe_repairing%1:04:00:: , bricklaying---bricklaying%1:04:00:: , carpentry---carpentry%1:04:00:: , cabinet---cabinet%1:06:00:: making---making%1:04:00:: , auto mechanics---auto_mechanics%1:04:00:: , and airplane mechanics---airplane_mechanics%1:04:00:: .
The physical facilities---facility%1:06:00:: at Dunbar---group%1:03:00:: are impressive , but more impressive is the attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of the pupils---pupil%1:18:00:: .
Nothing like Godot---person%1:03:00:: , he arrived before the hour---hour%1:28:01:: .
His letter---letter%1:10:00:: had suggested we meet at my hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: at noon---noon%1:28:00:: on Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: , and I came into the lobby---lobby%1:06:00:: as the clock---clock%1:06:00:: struck twelve .
My wish---wish%1:12:00:: to meet Samuel Beckett---person%1:03:00:: had been prompted by simple curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: and interest---interest%1:09:00:: in his work---work%1:06:00:: .
American newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: reviewers---reviewer%1:18:01:: like to call his plays---play%1:10:01:: nihilistic .
They find deep pessimism---pessimism%1:12:00:: in them .
Even so astute a commentator---commentator%1:18:01:: as Harold Clurman---person%1:03:00:: of The Nation---group%1:03:00:: has said that `` Waiting for Godot '' is `` the concentrate---concentrate%1:09:00:: of the contemporary European mood---mood%1:26:00:: of despair---despair%1:26:00:: '' .
But to me Beckett---person%1:03:00:: 's writing---writing%1:10:02:: had seemed permeated with love---love%1:12:00:: for human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: and with a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of humor---humor%1:07:01:: that I could reconcile neither with despair---despair%1:26:00:: nor with nihilism---nihilism%1:09:00:: .
Could it be that my own eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and ears---ear%1:08:00:: had deceived me ?
Is his a literature---literature%1:10:00:: of defeat---defeat%1:12:00:: , irrelevant to the social crises---crisis%1:26:00:: we face ?
I knew that a conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: with the author---author%1:18:00:: would not settle such questions---question%1:10:01:: , because a man---man%1:18:04:: is not the same as his writing---writing%1:10:02:: : in the last analysis , the questions---question%1:10:01:: had to be settled by the work---work%1:06:00:: itself .
My curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: was sharpened a day---day%1:28:00:: or two before the interview---interview%1:10:01:: by a conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: I had with a well-informed teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: of literature---literature%1:09:00:: , a Jesuit---jesuit%1:18:00:: father---father%1:18:01:: , at a conference---conference%1:14:00:: on religious drama---drama%1:10:00:: near Paris---paris%1:15:00:: .
When Beckett---person%1:03:00:: 's name---name%1:10:00:: came into the discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: , the priest---priest%1:18:00:: grew loud and told me that Beckett---person%1:03:00:: `` hates life---life%1:09:00:: '' .
That , I thought , is at least one thing---thing%1:09:00:: I can find out when we meet .
Beckett---person%1:03:00:: 's appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: is rough-hewn Irish .
The features---feature%1:08:00:: of his face---face%1:08:00:: are distinct , but not fine .
They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel---chisel%1:06:00:: .
Unruly hair---hair%1:08:00:: goes straight up from his forehead---forehead%1:08:00:: , standing so high that the top falls gently over , as if to show that it really is hair---hair%1:08:00:: and not bristle---bristle%1:05:00:: .
One might say it combines the man---man%1:18:00:: ; own pride---pride%1:07:00:: and humility---humility%1:07:00:: .
For he has the pride---pride%1:07:00:: that comes of self acceptance---self_acceptance%1:07:00:: and the humility---humility%1:07:00:: , perhaps of the same genesis---genesis%1:11:00:: , not to impose himself upon another .
His light blue eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , set deep within the face---face%1:08:00:: , are actively and continually looking .
He seems , by some unconscious division---division%1:04:00:: of labor---labor%1:04:00:: , to have given them that one function---function%1:07:00:: and no other , leaving communication---communication%1:10:01:: to the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the face---face%1:08:00:: .
The mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: frequently breaks into a disarming smile---smile%1:10:00:: .
The voice---voice%1:07:00:: is light in timbre---timbre%1:07:00:: , with a rough edge---edge%1:07:01:: that corresponds to his visage---visage%1:07:00:: .
The Irish accent---accent%1:10:01:: is , as one would expect , combined with slight inflections---inflection%1:10:00:: from the French---french%1:10:00:: .
His tweed---tweed%1:06:00:: suit---suit%1:06:00:: was a baggy gray and green .
He wore a brown knit---knit%1:06:02:: sports shirt---sport_shirt%1:06:00:: with no tie---tie%1:06:01:: .
We walked down the Rue de L ' Arcade---location%1:03:00:: , thence along beside the Madeleine---location%1:03:00:: and across to a sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: cafe---cafe%1:06:00:: opposite that church---church%1:06:00:: .
The conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world shattering .
For one thing , the world---world%1:09:00:: that Beckett---person%1:03:00:: sees is already shattered .
His talk---talk%1:10:00:: turns to what he calls `` the mess---mess%1:26:00:: '' , or sometimes `` this buzzing confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: '' .
I reconstruct his sentences---sentence%1:10:00:: from notes---note%1:10:00:: made immediately after our conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: .
What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words---words%1:10:03:: .
`` The confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: is not my invention---invention%1:06:00:: .
We cannot listen to a conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: for five minutes---minute%1:28:00:: without being acutely aware of the confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: .
It is all around us and our only chance---chance%1:26:00:: now is to let it in .
The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and see the mess .
The only chance---chance%1:26:00:: of renovation---renovation%1:04:00:: is to open our eyes---eye%1:09:00:: and see the mess---mess%1:26:00:: .
It is not a mess---mess%1:26:00:: you can make sense of '' .
I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth---truth%1:09:00:: , but Beckett---person%1:03:00:: did not take to the word---word%1:10:00:: truth---truth%1:09:00:: .
One cannot speak anymore of being---being%1:26:00:: , one must speak only of the mess---mess%1:26:00:: .
When Heidegger---person%1:03:00:: and Sartre---person%1:03:00:: speak of a contrast---contrast%1:09:01:: between being---being%1:26:00:: and existence---existence%1:26:00:: , they may be right , I do n't know , but their language---language%1:10:02:: is too philosophical for me .
I am not a philosopher---philosopher%1:18:00:: .
One can only speak of what is in front of him , and that now is simply the mess---mess%1:26:00:: '' .
Then he began to speak about the tension---tension%1:26:02:: in art---art%1:06:00:: between the mess---mess%1:26:00:: and form---form%1:09:00:: .
Until recently , art---art%1:06:00:: has withstood the pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: of chaotic things---thing%1:26:00:: .
It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form---form%1:09:00:: .
`` How could the mess---mess%1:26:00:: be admitted , because it appears to be the very opposite---opposite%1:24:03:: of form---form%1:09:00:: and therefore destructive of the very thing---thing%1:09:00:: that art---art%1:06:00:: holds itself to be '' ?
But now we can keep it out no longer , because we have come into a time---time%1:28:00:: when `` it invades our experience---experience%1:09:00:: at every moment---moment%1:28:00:: .
I granted this might be so , but found the result---result%1:19:00:: to be even more attention---attention%1:09:00:: to form---form%1:09:00:: than was the case---case%1:26:00:: previously .
How , I asked , could chaos---chaos%1:26:00:: be admitted to chaos---chaos%1:26:00:: ?
Would not that be the end---end%1:28:00:: of thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: and the end---end%1:28:00:: of art---art%1:06:00:: ?
If we look at recent art---art%1:06:00:: we find it preoccupied with form---form%1:09:00:: .
Beckett---person%1:03:00:: 's own work---work%1:06:00:: is an example---example%1:09:00:: .
Plays---play%1:10:01:: more highly formalized than `` Waiting for Godot '' , `` Endgame '' , and `` Krapp 's Last Tape '' would be hard to find .
`` What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form---form%1:09:00:: in art---art%1:06:00:: .
It only means that there will be new form---form%1:09:00:: , and that this form---form%1:09:00:: will be of such a type---type%1:09:00:: that it admits the chaos---chaos%1:26:00:: and does not try to say that the chaos---chaos%1:26:00:: is really something else .
The form---form%1:09:00:: and the chaos---chaos%1:26:00:: remain separate .
That is why the form---form%1:09:00:: itself becomes a preoccupation---preoccupation%1:09:02:: , because it exists as a problem---problem%1:26:00:: separate from the material---material%1:10:00:: it accommodates .
To find a form---form%1:09:00:: that accommodates the mess---mess%1:26:00:: , that is the task---task%1:04:00:: of the artist---artist%1:18:00:: now '' .
Yet , I responded , could not similar things---thing%1:10:00:: be said about the art---art%1:06:00:: of the past---past%1:28:00:: ?
Is it not characteristic of the greatest art---art%1:06:00:: that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify , demanding that the viewer---viewer%1:18:01:: respond to it in his own never predictable way---way%1:07:01:: ?
What is the history---history%1:28:00:: of criticism---criticism%1:10:01:: but the history---history%1:28:00:: of men---man%1:18:04:: attempting to make sense of the manifold elements---element%1:09:00:: in art---art%1:06:00:: that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: or a single aesthetic theory---theory%1:09:00:: ?
Is n't all art---art%1:06:00:: ambiguous ?
The classical lines---line%1:25:00:: of the church---church%1:06:00:: which Napoleon---person%1:03:00:: thought of as a Temple---temple%1:06:01:: of Glory---glory%1:07:00:: , dominated all the scene---scene%1:09:00:: where we sat .
The Boulevard de la Madeleine---location%1:03:00:: , the Boulevard Malesherbes---location%1:03:00:: , and the Rue Royale---location%1:03:00:: ran to it with graceful flattery---flattery%1:10:00:: , bearing tidings---tidings%1:10:00:: of the Age of Reason---age_of_reason%1:14:00:: .
This does not allow the mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: to invade us .
With classical art---art%1:06:00:: , all is settled .
But it is different at Chartres---location%1:03:00:: .
There is the unexplainable , and there art---art%1:06:00:: raises questions---question%1:10:01:: that it does not attempt to answer '' .
I asked about the battle---battle%1:04:01:: between life---life%1:09:00:: and death---death%1:26:00:: in his plays---play%1:10:01:: .
Didi---person%1:03:00:: and Gogo---person%1:03:00:: hover on the edge---edge%1:15:00:: of suicide---suicide%1:04:00:: ; Hamm---person%1:03:00:: 's world---world%1:09:00:: is death---death%1:26:00:: and Clov---person%1:03:00:: may or may not get out of it to join the living child---child%1:18:00:: outside .
Is this life death question---question%1:10:01:: a part---part%1:24:00:: of the chaos---chaos%1:26:00:: ?
If life---life%1:09:00:: and death---death%1:26:00:: did not both present themselves to us , there would be no inscrutability---inscrutability%1:07:00:: .
If there were only darkness---darkness%1:26:01:: , all would be clear .
It is because there is not only darkness---darkness%1:26:01:: but also light---light%1:26:01:: that our situation---situation%1:26:00:: becomes inexplicable .
Take Augustine---person%1:03:00:: 's doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: of grace---grace%1:26:00:: given and grace---grace%1:26:00:: withheld : have you pondered the dramatic qualities---quality%1:07:00:: in this theology---theology%1:09:00:: ?
Two thieves---thief%1:18:00:: are crucified with Christ---christ%1:18:00:: , one saved and the other damned .
How can we make sense of this division---division%1:04:00:: ?
In classical drama---drama%1:10:00:: , such problems---problem%1:26:00:: do not arise .
The destiny---destiny%1:11:00:: of Racine---racine%1:18:00:: 's Phedre is sealed from the beginning---beginning%1:09:00:: : she will proceed into the dark---dark%1:26:01:: .
At the beginning---beginning%1:09:00:: of the play---play%1:10:01:: she has partial illumination---illumination%1:26:01:: and at the end---end%1:09:00:: she has complete illumination---illumination%1:26:01:: , but there has been no question---question%1:07:00:: but that she moves toward the dark---dark%1:26:01:: .
That is the play---play%1:10:01:: .
Within this notion---notion%1:09:00:: clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: is possible , but for us who are neither Greek---greek%1:18:00:: nor Jansenist---jansenist%1:18:00:: there is not such clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: .
The question---question%1:07:00:: would also be removed if we believed in the contrary---contrary%1:24:01:: - total salvation---salvation%1:04:00:: .
But where we have both dark---dark%1:26:01:: and light---light%1:26:01:: we have also the inexplicable .
The key word---word%1:10:00:: in my plays---play%1:10:01:: is ' perhaps '' ' .
Given a theological lead---lead%1:09:00:: , I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance---significance%1:10:00:: to his plays---play%1:10:01:: .
I have no religious feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: .
Once I had a religious emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: .
It was at my first Communion---communion%1:04:01:: .
My mother---mother%1:18:00:: was deeply religious .
So was my brother---brother%1:18:00:: .
He knelt down at his bed---bed%1:06:00:: as long as he could kneel .
My father---father%1:18:00:: had none .
The family---family%1:14:02:: was Protestant---protestant%1:18:00:: , but for me it was only irksome and I let it go .
My brother---brother%1:18:00:: and mother---mother%1:18:00:: got no value---value%1:07:00:: from their religion---religion%1:14:00:: when they died .
At the moment---moment%1:28:00:: of crisis---crisis%1:11:00:: it had no more depth---depth%1:07:01:: than an old school---school%1:14:00:: tie---tie%1:06:01:: .
Irish Catholicism---catholicism%1:09:00:: is not attractive , but it is deeper .
When you pass a church---church%1:06:00:: on an Irish bus---bus%1:06:00:: , all the hands---hand%1:08:00:: flurry in the sign of the cross---sign_of_the_cross%1:10:00:: .
One day---day%1:28:03:: the dogs---dog%1:05:00:: of Ireland---ireland%1:15:00:: will do that too and perhaps also the pigs---pig%1:05:00:: '' .
But do the plays deal with the same facets---facet%1:09:00:: of experience---experience%1:09:00:: religion---religion%1:14:00:: must also deal with ?
`` Yes , for they deal with distress---distress%1:12:02:: .
Some people---people%1:14:00:: object to this in my writing---writing%1:10:00:: .
At a party---party%1:11:00:: an English intellectual---intellectual%1:18:00:: - so-called - asked me why I write always about distress---distress%1:12:02:: .
He wanted to know if my father---father%1:18:00:: had beaten me or my mother---mother%1:18:00:: had run away from home---home%1:15:04:: to give me an unhappy childhood---childhood%1:28:00:: .
I told him no , that I had had a very happy childhood---childhood%1:28:00:: .
I left the party---party%1:11:00:: as soon as possible and got into a taxi---taxi%1:06:00:: .
On the glass---glass%1:27:00:: partition---partition%1:06:00:: between me and the driver---driver%1:18:00:: were three signs---sign%1:10:00:: :
one asked for help---help%1:04:00:: for the blind---blind%1:14:00:: , another help---help%1:04:00:: for orphans---orphan%1:18:00:: , and the third for relief---relief%1:04:02:: for the war---war%1:04:00:: refugees---refugee%1:18:00:: .
One does not have to look for distress---distress%1:12:02:: .
It is screaming at you even in the taxis---taxi%1:06:00:: of London---london%1:15:00:: '' .
Lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: was over , and we walked back to the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: with the light---light%1:26:01:: and dark---dark%1:15:00:: of Paris---paris%1:15:00:: screaming at us .
Lunch was over , and we walked back to the hotel with the light---light%1:07:01:: and dark---dark%1:26:01:: of Paris screaming at us .
The personal quality---quality%1:07:00:: of Samuel Beckett---person%1:03:00:: is similar to qualities---quality%1:07:00:: I had found in the plays---play%1:10:01:: .
He says nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: that compresses experience---experience%1:09:00:: within a closed pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: .
`` Perhaps '' stands in place of commitment---commitment%1:07:01:: .
If there were only the mess---mess%1:26:00:: , all would be clear ; but there is also compassion---compassion%1:12:00:: .
As a Christian---christian%1:18:00:: , I know I do not stand where Beckett---person%1:03:00:: stands , but I do see much of what he sees .
As a writer---writer%1:18:00:: on the theater---theater%1:10:00:: , I have paid close attention to the plays---play%1:10:01:: .
Harold Clurman---person%1:03:00:: is right to say that `` Waiting for Godot '' is a reflection---reflection%1:07:02:: ( he calls it a distorted reflection---reflection%1:07:02:: ) `` of the impasse---impasse%1:26:00:: and disarray---disarray%1:09:00:: of Europe---europe%1:17:00:: 's present politics---politics%1:24:00:: , ethic---ethic%1:09:00:: , and common way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: '' .
Harold Clurman is right to say that `` Waiting for Godot '' is a reflection---reflection%1:09:00:: ( he calls it a distorted reflection---reflection%1:09:00:: ) `` of the impasse and disarray of Europe 's present politics , ethic , and common way of life '' .
Yet it is not only Europe---europe%1:17:00:: the play---play%1:10:01:: refers to .
`` Waiting for Godot '' sells even better in America---america%1:15:00:: than in France---france%1:15:00:: .
The consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe---europe%1:17:00:: than to America---america%1:15:00:: , but it is the consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: that most `` mature '' societies---society%1:14:00:: arrive at when their successes---success%1:04:00:: in technological and economic systematization---systematization%1:04:00:: propel them into a time---time%1:28:00:: of examining the not strictly practical ends---end%1:09:02:: of culture---culture%1:09:01:: .
America---america%1:15:00:: is now joining Europe---europe%1:17:00:: in this `` mature '' phase---phase%1:28:00:: of development---development%1:22:02:: .
Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result---result%1:19:00:: of the technological and economic revolutions---revolution%1:11:01:: now going on in the countries---country%1:14:00:: of Asia---asia%1:17:00:: and Africa---africa%1:17:00:: , and also of course on how long the cold war---cold_war%1:26:00:: remains cold .
The `` reality---reality%1:09:00:: '' to which they respond is rationally empty and their art---art%1:06:00:: is an imitation---imitation%1:04:00:: of the inescapable powerfulness---powerfulness%1:07:00:: of this unknown and empty world---world%1:09:00:: .
Their artistic rationale---rationale%1:09:00:: is given to the witness---witness%1:10:00:: of unreason---unreason%1:26:00:: .
These polar concerns---concern%1:09:00:: ( imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: vs. formalism---formalism%1:09:01:: ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation---situation%1:26:01:: which has been developing over a long period of time---period_of_time%1:28:00:: .
The breakdown---breakdown%1:04:02:: of classical structures---structure%1:09:00:: of meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: in all realms---realm%1:26:01:: of western culture---culture%1:09:01:: has given rise to several generations---generation%1:14:01:: of artists---artist%1:18:00:: who have documented the disintegrative processes .
Thus the image---image%1:09:00:: of man has suffered complete fragmentation---fragmentation%1:04:00:: in personal and spiritual qualities---quality%1:07:00:: , and complete objectification---objectification%1:04:00:: in sub-human and quasi mechanistic powers---power%1:09:01:: .
The image---image%1:09:00:: of the world---world%1:17:01:: tends to reflect the hostility---hostility%1:07:00:: and indifference---indifference%1:07:00:: of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces---space%1:25:00:: and overwhelming mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: .
The image---image%1:09:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: has simply disappeared .
All such imitations---imitation%1:04:00:: of negative quality---quality%1:07:00:: have given rise to a compensatory response---response%1:19:00:: in the form---form%1:09:01:: of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism---humanism%1:09:00:: : if man can neither know nor love reality---reality%1:26:02:: as it is , he can at least invent an artistic `` reality---reality%1:09:00:: '' which is its own world---world%1:09:00:: and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities---quality%1:07:00:: capable of being known and worthy of being loved .
The person---person%1:03:00:: of the artist---artist%1:18:00:: becomes a final bastion---bastion%1:14:00:: of meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: in a world---world%1:09:00:: rendered meaningless by the march---march%1:04:02:: of events---event%1:03:00:: and the decay---decay%1:22:02:: of classical religious and philosophical systems---system%1:09:02:: .
Whatever pole---pole%1:09:00:: of this contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: one emphasizes and whatever the tension---tension%1:26:02:: between these two approaches---approach%1:04:02:: to understanding the artistic imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: , it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive , that they belong together .
Without the decay---decay%1:22:02:: of a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of objective reference---reference%1:10:06:: ( except as the imitation---imitation%1:04:00:: of mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: ) , the stress---stress%1:26:03:: on subjective invention---invention%1:09:00:: would never have been stimulated into being---being%1:26:00:: .
And although these insights---insight%1:09:02:: into the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of art---art%1:06:00:: may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: of art---art%1:06:00:: , their peculiar authenticity---authenticity%1:07:00:: in this day---day%1:28:05:: and age---age%1:28:02:: requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise---promise%1:09:00:: that from their very substance---substance%1:09:00:: , new and valid chapters---chapter%1:10:00:: in the philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: of art---art%1:06:00:: may be written .
For better---better%1:07:00:: or worse---worse%1:07:00:: we cannot regard `` imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: '' in the arts---art%1:06:00:: in the simple mode---mode%1:07:00:: of classical rationalism---rationalism%1:09:02:: or detached realism .
A broader concept---concept%1:09:00:: of imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: is needed , one which acknowledges that true invention---invention%1:09:00:: is important , that the artist---artist%1:18:00:: 's creativity---creativity%1:09:00:: in part transcends the non artistic causal factors---causal_factor%1:09:00:: out of which it arises .
On the other hand , we cannot regard artistic invention---invention%1:09:00:: as pure , uncaused , and unrelated to the times---times%1:28:01:: in which it occurs .
We need a doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: of imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: to save us from the solipsism---solipsism%1:09:00:: and futility---futility%1:07:00:: of pure formalism---formalism%1:09:01:: .
Accordingly , it is the aim---aim%1:09:00:: of this essay---essay%1:10:00:: to advance a new theory---theory%1:09:02:: of imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: ( which I shall call mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: in order to distinguish it from earlier theories---theory%1:09:02:: of imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: ) and a new theory---theory%1:09:02:: of invention---invention%1:09:00:: ( which I shall call symbol for reasons---reason%1:16:00:: to be stated hereafter ) .
The word---word%1:10:00:: `` mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: '' ( `` imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: '' ) is usually associated with Plato---plato%1:18:00:: and Aristotle---aristotle%1:18:00:: .
For Plato---plato%1:18:00:: , `` imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: '' is twice removed from reality---reality%1:26:01:: , being a poor copy---copy%1:06:00:: of physical appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: , which in itself is a poor copy---copy%1:06:00:: of ideal essence---essence%1:09:00:: .
All artistic and mythological representations---representation%1:09:00:: , therefore , are `` imitations---imitation%1:06:00:: of imitations---imitation%1:06:00:: '' and are completely superseded by the truth---truth%1:26:00:: value---value%1:07:00:: of `` dialectic---dialectic%1:09:00:: '' , the proper use---use%1:07:00:: of the inquiring intellect---intellect%1:09:02:: .
In Plato---plato%1:18:00:: 's judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: , the arts---art%1:06:00:: play a meaningful role---role%1:04:00:: in society---society%1:14:00:: only in the education---education%1:04:00:: of the young , prior to the full development---development%1:22:02:: of their intellectual powers---power%1:09:01:: .
Presupposed in Plato---plato%1:18:00:: 's system---system%1:09:02:: is a doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: of levels---level%1:26:00:: of insight---insight%1:09:02:: , in which a certain kind---kind%1:09:00:: of detached understanding---understanding%1:09:00:: is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom---wisdom%1:09:02:: .
Aristotle---aristotle%1:18:00:: also tended to stratify all aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of human nature---nature%1:07:02:: and activity---activity%1:04:00:: into levels---level%1:26:00:: of excellence---excellence%1:07:00:: and , like Plato---plato%1:18:00:: , he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect---intellect%1:09:02:: on the top level---level%1:26:00:: .
The Poetics , in affirming that all human arts---art%1:06:00:: are `` modes---mode%1:07:00:: of imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: '' , gives a more serious role---role%1:07:00:: to artistic mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: than did Plato---plato%1:18:00:: .
But Aristotle---aristotle%1:18:00:: kept the principle---principle%1:09:00:: of levels---level%1:26:00:: and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of character---character%1:07:01:: and action---action%1:04:02:: must be imitated if the play---play%1:10:01:: is to be a vehicle---vehicle%1:10:00:: of serious and important human truths---truth%1:09:00:: .
For both Plato---plato%1:18:00:: and Aristotle---aristotle%1:18:00:: artistic mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: , in contrast to the power---power%1:07:00:: of dialectic---dialectic%1:09:00:: , is relatively incapable of expressing the character---character%1:09:00:: of fundamental reality---reality%1:26:01:: .
The central concern---concern%1:09:00:: of Erich Auerbach---person%1:03:00:: 's impressive volume---volume%1:06:00:: called Mimesis is to describe the shift---shift%1:11:01:: from a classic theory---theory%1:09:02:: of imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: ( based upon a recognition---recognition%1:26:00:: of levels---level%1:26:00:: of truth---truth%1:09:00:: ) to a Christian theory---theory%1:09:02:: of imitation---imitation%1:09:00:: in which the levels---level%1:26:00:: are dissolved .
Following the theme---theme%1:10:00:: of Incarnation---incarnation%1:10:00:: in the Gospels---gospels%1:10:00:: , the Christian artist---artist%1:18:00:: and critic---critic%1:18:00:: sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events---event%1:03:00:: `` figures---figure%1:06:00:: '' of divine power---power%1:07:00:: and reality---reality%1:26:01:: .
Here artistic realism involves the audience---audience%1:14:01:: in an impassioned participation---participation%1:04:00:: in events---event%1:03:00:: whose overtones---overtone%1:10:00:: and implications---implication%1:09:00:: are transcendent .
Artistic mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: under Christian influence---influence%1:04:00:: records the involvement---involvement%1:04:00:: of all persons---person%1:03:00:: , however humble , in a divine drama---drama%1:11:00:: .
The artist---artist%1:18:00:: , unlike the philosopher---philosopher%1:18:00:: , is not a removed observer---observer%1:18:00:: aiming at neutral and rarified high levels---level%1:07:00:: of abstraction---abstraction%1:09:02:: .
He is the conveyor---conveyor%1:18:00:: of a sacred reality---reality%1:26:01:: by which he has been grasped .
I have chosen to use the word---word%1:10:00:: `` mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: '' in its Christian rather than its classic implications---implication%1:09:00:: and to discover in the concrete forms---form%1:09:01:: of both art---art%1:06:00:: and myth---myth%1:10:00:: powers---power%1:07:00:: of theological expression---expression%1:10:02:: which , as in the Christian mind---mind%1:09:00:: , are the direct consequence---consequence%1:19:00:: of involvement---involvement%1:04:00:: in historical experience---experience%1:09:00:: , which are not reserved , as in the Greek mind---mind%1:09:00:: , only to moments---moment%1:28:00:: of theoretical reflection---reflection%1:09:00:: .
In the first instance---instance%1:09:00:: , `` mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: '' is here used to mean the recalling of experience---experience%1:09:00:: in terms of vivid images---image%1:09:00:: rather than in terms of abstract ideas---idea%1:09:00:: or conventional designations---designation%1:10:00:: .
By `` image---image%1:09:00:: '' is meant not only a visual presentation---presentation%1:10:00:: , but also remembered sensations---sensation%1:09:00:: of any of the five senses---sense%1:09:02:: plus the feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: which are immediately conjoined therewith .
This is the primary function---function%1:07:00:: of the imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: operating in the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of the original experiential stimulus---stimulus%1:09:00:: by which the images---image%1:09:00:: were first appropriated .
Mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: is the nearest possible thing---thing%1:26:00:: to the actual re-living---reliving%1:09:00:: of experience---experience%1:09:00:: , in which the imagining person---person%1:03:00:: recovers through images---image%1:09:00:: something of the force---force%1:07:01:: and depth---depth%1:07:01:: characteristic of experience---experience%1:09:00:: itself .
The images---image%1:09:00:: themselves , like their counterparts---counterpart%1:09:00:: in experience---experience%1:09:00:: , are not neutral qualities---quality%1:07:00:: to be surveyed dispassionately ; they are fields of force exerting a unique influence---influence%1:09:00:: on the sensibilities---sensibility%1:09:00:: and a unique relatedness---relatedness%1:24:00:: to one another .
They bring an inextricable component---component%1:09:00:: of value---value%1:07:00:: within themselves , with attractions---attraction%1:19:00:: and repulsions---repulsion%1:19:00:: native to their own quality---quality%1:07:00:: .
As in experience---experience%1:09:00:: one is seized by given entities---entity%1:03:00:: and their interrelations---interrelation%1:24:00:: and is forced to respond in value---value%1:07:00:: feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: to them , so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation---presentation%1:10:00:: of images---image%1:09:00:: .
Mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: here is not to be confused with literalism---literalism%1:09:00:: or realism in the conventional sense---sense%1:10:00:: .
A word---word%1:10:00:: taken in its dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: , a photographic image---image%1:06:00:: of a recognizable object---object%1:03:00:: , the mere picturing---picturing%1:04:00:: of a `` scene---scene%1:06:01:: '' tends to lose experiential vividness---vividness%1:07:01:: and to connote such conventional abstractions---abstraction%1:09:00:: as to invite neutral reception---reception%1:04:00:: without the incitement---incitement%1:04:02:: of value---value%1:07:00:: feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: .
Similarly experience---experience%1:09:00:: itself can be conventionalized so that people---people%1:14:00:: react to certain preconceived clues---clue%1:10:00:: for behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: without awareness---awareness%1:09:00:: of the vitality---vitality%1:07:01:: of their experiential field---field%1:26:00:: .
A truly vivid imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: moves beyond the conventional recollection---recollection%1:09:00:: to a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of immediacy---immediacy%1:07:02:: .
The mimetic character---character%1:09:00:: of the imaginative consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: tends to express itself in the presentation---presentation%1:10:00:: of artistic forms---form%1:09:00:: and materials---material%1:10:00:: .
When words---word%1:10:00:: can be used in a more fresh and primitive way---way%1:07:01:: so that they strike with the force---force%1:07:01:: of sights---sight%1:10:00:: and sounds---sound%1:09:00:: , when tones---tone%1:07:01:: of sound---sound%1:09:00:: and colors---color%1:07:00:: of paint---paint%1:06:00:: and the carven shape---shape%1:07:00:: all strike the sensibilities---sensibility%1:09:00:: with an undeniable force---force%1:07:01:: of data---datum%1:09:00:: in and of themselves , compelling the observer---observer%1:18:00:: into an attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of attention---attention%1:09:00:: , all this imitates the way---way%1:07:01:: experience---experience%1:09:00:: itself in its deepest character---character%1:09:00:: strikes upon the door---door%1:07:00:: of consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: and clamors for entrance---entrance%1:11:00:: .
These are like the initial ways---way%1:04:01:: in which the world---world%1:09:00:: forces itself upon the self---self%1:09:00:: and thrusts the self---self%1:09:00:: into decision---decision%1:04:00:: and choice---choice%1:04:00:: .
The presence---presence%1:26:00:: of genuine mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: in art---art%1:06:00:: is marked by the persistence---persistence%1:07:00:: with which the work---work%1:06:00:: demands attention---attention%1:09:00:: and compels valuation---valuation%1:09:00:: even though it is but vaguely understood .
Underlying these conceptions---conception%1:09:00:: of mimesis---mimesis%1:09:00:: are certain presuppositions---presupposition%1:09:00:: concerning the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of primary human experience---experience%1:09:00:: which require some exposition---exposition%1:10:00:: before the main argument---argument%1:10:02:: can proceed .
Experience---experience%1:09:00:: is not seen , as it is in classical rationalism---rationalism%1:09:02:: , as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects---object%1:03:00:: simply located in space---space%1:03:00:: and registering their character---character%1:09:00:: , movements---movement%1:04:00:: , and changes---change%1:04:00:: on the tabula rasa---tabula_rasa%1:09:00:: of an uninvolved intellect---intellect%1:09:02:: .
Neither is primary experience---experience%1:09:00:: understood according to the attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of modern empiricism---empiricism%1:09:00:: in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals---signal%1:10:00:: of sensory qualities---quality%1:09:00:: producing their responses---response%1:04:01:: in the appropriate sense organs---sense_organ%1:08:00:: .
Primary feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: of the world---world%1:09:00:: come neither as a collection---collection%1:14:00:: of clearly known objects---object%1:03:00:: ( houses---house%1:06:00:: , trees---tree%1:20:00:: , implements---implement%1:06:00:: , etc . ) nor a collection---collection%1:14:00:: of isolated and neutral sensory qualities---quality%1:09:00:: .
In contrast to all this , primary data---datum%1:09:00:: are data---datum%1:09:00:: of a self---self%1:09:00:: involved in environing processes---process%1:04:00:: and powers---power%1:07:00:: .
The most primitive feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: are rudimentary value---value%1:07:00:: feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: , both positive and negative : a desire---desire%1:12:00:: to appropriate this or that part---part%1:24:00:: of the environment---environment%1:26:00:: into oneself ; a desire---desire%1:12:00:: to avoid and repel this or that other part---part%1:24:00:: .
These desires---desire%1:12:00:: presuppose a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of causally efficacious powers---power%1:07:00:: in which one is involved , some working for one 's good---good%1:07:00:: , others threatening ill .
Gone is the tabula rasa---tabula_rasa%1:09:00:: of the mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
In its place---place%1:04:01:: is a passionate consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: grasped and molded to feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: of positive or negative values---value%1:07:00:: even as the actions---action%1:04:02:: of one 's life---life%1:26:02:: are determined by constellations---constellation%1:09:00:: of process in which one is caught .
The principal defender---defender%1:18:00:: of this view---view%1:09:02:: of primary experience---experience%1:09:00:: as `` causal efficacy---efficacy%1:07:00:: '' is Alfred North Whitehead---person%1:03:00:: .
Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions---impression%1:09:00:: , he says , are those of being involved in a large arena---arena%1:26:00:: of powers---power%1:07:00:: which have a longer past---past%1:28:01:: than our own , which are interrelated in a vast movement---movement%1:04:00:: through the present---present%1:28:00:: toward the future---future%1:28:00:: .
We feel the quality---quality%1:09:00:: of these powers---power%1:07:00:: initially as in some degree---degree%1:26:01:: wholesome or threatening .
Later abstractive and rational processes---process%1:09:00:: may indicate errors---error%1:09:00:: of judgment---judgment%1:04:02:: in these apprehensions---apprehension%1:09:00:: of value---value%1:07:00:: , but the apprehensions---apprehension%1:09:00:: themselves are the primary stuff---stuff%1:27:00:: of experience---experience%1:09:00:: .
It takes a great deal---great_deal%1:23:00:: of abstraction---abstraction%1:09:02:: to free oneself from the primitive impression---impression%1:09:00:: of larger unities---unity%1:26:00:: of power---power%1:07:00:: and influence---influence%1:07:00:: and to view one 's world---world%1:09:00:: simply as a collection---collection%1:14:00:: of sense data---sense_datum%1:09:00:: arranged in such and such sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: and pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: , devoid of all power---power%1:09:01:: to move the feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: and actions---action%1:04:02:: except in so far as they present themselves for inspection .
Whitehead---person%1:03:00:: is here questioning David Hume---person%1:03:00:: 's understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of experience---experience%1:09:00:: ; he is questioning , also , every epistemology---epistemology%1:09:00:: which stems from Hume---person%1:03:00:: 's presupposition---presupposition%1:09:00:: that experience---experience%1:09:00:: is merely sense data---sense_datum%1:09:00:: in abstraction---abstraction%1:09:00:: from causal efficacy---efficacy%1:07:00:: , and that causal efficacy---efficacy%1:07:00:: is something intellectually imputed to the world---world%1:17:01:: , not directly perceived .
What Hume---person%1:03:00:: calls `` sensation---sensation%1:09:00:: '' is what Whitehead---person%1:03:00:: calls `` perception---perception%1:09:01:: in the mode---mode%1:07:00:: of presentational immediacy---immediacy%1:07:02:: '' which is a sophisticated abstraction---abstraction%1:09:00:: from perception---perception%1:09:01:: in the mode---mode%1:07:00:: of causal efficacy---efficacy%1:07:00:: .
As long as perception---perception%1:09:01:: is seen as composed only of isolated sense data---sense_datum%1:09:00:: , most of the quality---quality%1:09:00:: and interconnectedness---interconnectedness%1:26:00:: of existence---existence%1:26:00:: loses its objectivity---objectivity%1:07:00:: , becomes an invention---invention%1:09:00:: of consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: , and the result---result%1:19:00:: is a philosophical scepticism---scepticism%1:09:00:: .
Whitehead---person%1:03:00:: contends that the human way---way%1:07:01:: of understanding existence---existence%1:26:00:: as a unity---unity%1:26:00:: of interlocking and interdependent processes---process%1:09:00:: which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form---form%1:09:00:: of such an understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: , for all its vagueness---vagueness%1:07:00:: and tendency---tendency%1:12:00:: to mistake the detail---detail%1:24:00:: , is initially given in the way---way%1:07:01:: man feels the world---world%1:09:00:: .
In this respect---respect%1:09:00:: experience---experience%1:09:00:: is broader and full of a richer variety---variety%1:14:01:: of potential meanings---meaning%1:09:00:: than the mind---mind%1:09:00:: of man or any of his arts---art%1:09:00:: or culture---culture%1:09:01:: are capable of making clear and distinct .
A chief characteristic---characteristic%1:07:00:: of experience---experience%1:09:00:: in the mode---mode%1:07:00:: of causal efficacy---efficacy%1:07:00:: is one of derivation---derivation%1:09:00:: from the past---past%1:28:00:: .
Both I and my feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: come up out of a chain---chain%1:14:00:: of events---event%1:03:00:: that fan out into the past---past%1:28:00:: into sources---source%1:15:00:: that are ultimately very unlike the entity---entity%1:03:00:: which I now am .
As part---part%1:24:00:: of the same arrangement---arrangement%1:09:01:: , Torrio---person%1:03:00:: had , in the spirit---spirit%1:10:00:: of peace---peace%1:26:01:: and good will---good_will%1:07:00:: , and in exchange---exchange%1:04:02:: for armed support---support%1:04:00:: in the April---april%1:28:00:: election---election%1:04:01:: campaign---campaign%1:11:00:: , bestowed upon O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: a third share---share%1:21:00:: in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop---group%1:03:00:: proceeds---proceeds%1:21:00:: and a cut---cut%1:21:00:: in the Cicero---person%1:03:00:: beer---beer%1:13:00:: trade---trade%1:04:01:: .
The coalition---coalition%1:14:00:: was to prove inadvisable .
O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: was a complex and frightening man---man%1:18:00:: , whose bright blue eyes---eye%1:08:00:: stared with a kind of frozen candour---candour%1:07:00:: into others ' .
He had a round , frank Irish face---face%1:08:00:: , creased in a jovial grin---grin%1:10:00:: that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets---bullet%1:06:00:: into someone 's body---body%1:08:00:: .
He carried three guns---gun%1:06:00:: - one in the right trouser---trouser%1:06:00:: pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: , one under his left armpit---armpit%1:08:00:: , one in the left outside coat---coat%1:06:00:: pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: - and was equally lethal with both hands---hand%1:08:00:: .
The police---police%1:14:00:: credited him with twenty-five murders---murder%1:04:00:: but he was never brought to trial---trial%1:04:02:: for one of them .
Like a fair number---number%1:07:00:: of bootleggers---bootlegger%1:18:00:: he disliked alcohol---alcohol%1:13:00:: .
He was an expert florist---florist%1:18:00:: , tenderly dextrous in the arrangement---arrangement%1:07:00:: of bouquets---bouquet%1:06:00:: and wreaths---wreath%1:06:00:: .
He had no apparent comprehension---comprehension%1:09:00:: of morality---morality%1:07:00:: ; he divided humanity into `` right guys---guy%1:18:00:: '' and `` wrong guys---guy%1:18:00:: '' , and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under .
He had what was described by a psychologist---psychologist%1:18:00:: as a `` sunny brutality---brutality%1:07:00:: '' .
He walked with a heavy list---list%1:07:00:: to the right---right%1:15:00:: , as that leg---leg%1:08:01:: was four inches---inch%1:23:00:: shorter than the other , but the lurch---lurch%1:04:00:: did not reduce his feline quickness---quickness%1:09:01:: with his guns---gun%1:06:00:: .
Landesco---person%1:03:00:: thought him `` just a superior sort---sort%1:09:00:: of plugugly---plug-ugly%1:18:00:: '' but he was , in fact , with his aggression---aggression%1:12:00:: and hostility---hostility%1:07:00:: , and nerveless indifference---indifference%1:12:00:: to risking or administering pain---pain%1:26:00:: , a casebook psychopath---psychopath%1:18:00:: .
He was also at this time---time%1:28:00:: , although not so interwoven in high politics---politics%1:24:00:: and the rackets---racket%1:04:00:: as Torrio---person%1:03:00:: and Capone---person%1:03:00:: , the most powerful and most dangerous mob---mob%1:14:02:: leader---leader%1:18:00:: in the Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: underworld---underworld%1:14:00:: , the roughneck---roughneck%1:18:00:: king---king%1:18:01:: .
O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: was born in poverty---poverty%1:26:00:: , the son---son%1:18:00:: of an immigrant---immigrant%1:18:00:: Irish plasterer---plasterer%1:18:00:: , in the North Side---location%1:03:00:: 's Little Hell---location%1:03:00:: , close by the Sicilian quarter---quarter%1:15:00:: and Death Corner---location%1:03:00:: .
He had been a choir boy---choirboy%1:18:00:: at the Holy Name Cathedral---group%1:03:00:: and also served as an acolyte---acolyte%1:18:00:: to Father O ' Brien---person%1:03:00:: .
The influence---influence%1:09:00:: of Mass---mass%1:04:00:: was less pervasive than that of the congested , slum tenements---tenement%1:06:00:: among the bawdy houses---bawdyhouse%1:06:00:: , honkytonks---honkytonk%1:06:00:: , and sawdust saloons---sawdust_saloon%1:06:00:: of his birthplace---birthplace%1:15:00:: ; he ran wild with the child---child%1:18:00:: gangs---gang%1:14:01:: of the neighbourhood---neighbourhood%1:15:00:: , and went through the normal pressure-cooker course---course%1:04:00:: of thieving---thieving%1:04:00:: , police---police%1:14:00:: dodging---dodging%1:04:00:: , and housebreaking---housebreaking%1:04:00:: .
At the age---age%1:07:00:: of ten , when he was working as a newsboy---newsboy%1:18:00:: in the Loop---location%1:03:00:: , he was knocked down by a streetcar---streetcar%1:06:00:: which resulted in his permanently shortened leg---leg%1:08:01:: .
Because of this he was known as Gimpy---person%1:03:00:: ( but , as with Capone---person%1:03:00:: and his nickname---nickname%1:10:00:: of Scarface---person%1:03:00:: , never in his presence---presence%1:15:00:: ) .
In his teens---teens%1:28:00:: O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: was enrolled in the vicious Market Street---location%1:03:00:: gang---gang%1:14:01:: and he became a singing---singing%1:04:00:: waiter---waiter%1:18:00:: in McGovern's Cafe---group%1:03:00:: , a notoriously low and rowdy dive---dive%1:06:01:: in North Clark Street---location%1:03:00:: , where befuddled customers---customer%1:18:00:: were methodically looted of their money---money%1:21:00:: by the singing---singing%1:04:00:: waiters---waiter%1:18:00:: before being thrown out .
He then got a job---job%1:04:00:: with the Chicago Herald-Examiner---group%1:03:00:: as a circulation slugger , a rough fighter---fighter%1:18:00:: employed to see that his paper---paper%1:14:00:: 's news---news%1:10:01:: pitches---pitch%1:15:00:: were not trespassed upon by rival vendors---vendor%1:18:00:: .
He was also at the same time gaining practical experience---experience%1:09:01:: as a safe breaker---safebreaker%1:18:00:: and highwayman---highwayman%1:18:00:: , and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer---murderer%1:18:00:: named Gene Geary---person%1:03:00:: , later committed to Chester Asylum---group%1:03:00:: as a homicidal maniac---maniac%1:18:00:: , but whose eyes---eye%1:08:00:: misted with tears---tear%1:08:01:: when the young Dion---person%1:03:00:: sang a ballad---ballad%1:10:01:: about an Irish mother---mother%1:18:00:: in his clear and syrupy tenor---tenor%1:10:00:: .
O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: 's first conflict---conflict%1:04:00:: with the police---police%1:14:00:: came in 1909 , at seventeen , when he was committed to Bridewell Prison---group%1:03:00:: for three months---month%1:28:00:: for burglary---burglary%1:04:00:: ; two years---year%1:28:01:: later he served another three months---month%1:28:00:: for assault---assault%1:04:01:: .
Those were his only interludes---interlude%1:28:00:: behind bars---bar%1:06:02:: , although he collected four more charges---charge%1:10:00:: on his police---police%1:14:00:: record---record%1:10:03:: in 1921 and 1922 , three for burglary---burglary%1:04:00:: and one for robbery---robbery%1:04:00:: .
But by now O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: 's political pull---pull%1:07:00:: was beginning to be effective .
On the occasion---occasion%1:11:00:: of his 1922 indictment---indictment%1:10:00:: the $ 10000 bond---bond%1:21:03:: was furnished by an alderman---alderman%1:18:00:: , and the charge---charge%1:10:00:: was nolle prossed .
On one of his 1921 ventures---venture%1:04:00:: he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant John J. Ryan---person%1:03:00:: down on his knees---knee%1:08:00:: with a tool---tool%1:06:00:: embedded in a labour---labour%1:14:00:: office---office%1:14:01:: safe---safe%1:06:00:: in the Postal Telegraph Building---location%1:03:00:: ; the jury---jury%1:14:00:: wanted better evidence---evidence%1:10:00:: than that and he was acquitted , at a cost---cost%1:21:00:: of $ 30000 in bribes---bribe%1:21:00:: , it was estimated .
As promptly as Torrio---person%1:03:00:: , O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: jumped into bootlegging---bootlegging%1:04:00:: .
He conducted it with less diplomacy---diplomacy%1:07:00:: and more spontaneous violence---violence%1:04:01:: than the Sicilians---sicilian%1:18:00:: , but he had his huge North Side---location%1:03:00:: portion---portion%1:21:00:: to exploit and he made a great deal---great_deal%1:23:00:: of money---money%1:21:00:: .
Unlike the Sicilians---sicilian%1:18:00:: , he additionally conducted holdups---holdup%1:04:00:: , robberies---robbery%1:04:00:: , and safe---safe%1:06:00:: cracking---cracking%1:04:00:: expeditions---expedition%1:04:00:: , and refused to touch prostitution---prostitution%1:04:00:: .
He was also personally active in ward---ward%1:15:00:: politics---politics%1:24:00:: , and by 1924 O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: had acquired sufficient political might---might%1:07:00:: to be able to state : `` I always deliver my borough---borough%1:15:00:: as per requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: '' .
But whose requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: ?
Until 1924 O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: pistoleers---pistoleer%1:18:00:: and knuckle-duster---knuckle_duster%1:06:00:: bullyboys---bullyboy%1:18:00:: had kept his North Side---location%1:03:00:: domain---domain%1:15:00:: solidly Democratic .
There was a question---question%1:10:03:: and answer---answer%1:10:00:: gag---gag%1:10:00:: that went around at that time---time%1:28:00:: : Q. `` Who 'll carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards---ward%1:15:00:: '' ?
A. `` O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: , in his pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: '' .
But as November---november%1:28:00:: 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy---hierarchy%1:14:01:: was sorely troubled by grapevine---grapevine%1:10:00:: reports---report%1:10:01:: that O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: was being wooed by the opposition---opposition%1:14:00:: , and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans---republican%1:18:01:: .
To forestall any change---change%1:04:00:: of allegiance---allegiance%1:04:00:: , the Democrats---democrat%1:18:01:: hastily organised a testimonial---testimonial%1:10:01:: banquet---banquet%1:14:00:: for O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: , as public reward---reward%1:11:00:: for his past services---service%1:04:08:: and as a reminder---reminder%1:10:00:: of where his loyalties---loyalty%1:04:00:: lay .
The reception---reception%1:14:00:: was held in a private dining room---dining_room%1:06:00:: of the Webster Hotel---location%1:03:00:: on Lincoln Park West---location%1:03:00:: .
It was an interesting fraternisation---fraternisation%1:04:00:: of ex convicts---convict%1:18:00:: , union---union%1:14:01:: racketeers---racketeer%1:18:00:: , ward heelers---ward-heeler%1:18:00:: , sold-out officials---official%1:18:01:: , and gunmen---gunman%1:18:00:: .
The guest---guest%1:18:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: is in itself a little parable---parable%1:10:00:: of the state---state%1:03:00:: of American civic life---life%1:26:01:: at this time---time%1:28:00:: .
It included the top O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: men---men%1:14:00:: and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes---person%1:03:00:: .
When Mayor Dever---person%1:03:00:: heard of the banquet---banquet%1:14:00:: he summoned Hughes---person%1:03:00:: for an explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: of why he had been dishonouring the police department---police_department%1:14:00:: by consorting with these felons---felon%1:18:00:: and fixers---fixer%1:18:00:: .
Hughes---person%1:03:00:: said that he had understood the party---party%1:11:00:: was to be in honour---honour%1:26:00:: of Jerry O ' Connor---person%1:03:00:: , the proprieter---proprietor%1:18:00:: of a Loop---location%1:03:00:: gambling house---gambling_house%1:06:00:: .
`` But when I arrived and recognised a number---number%1:07:00:: of notorious characters---character%1:18:00:: I had thrown into the detective---detective%1:18:00:: bureau---bureau%1:14:00:: basement---basement%1:06:00:: half a dozen times---time%1:11:00:: , I knew I had been framed , and withdrew almost at once '' .
In fact , O ' Connor---person%1:03:00:: was honoured during the ceremony---ceremony%1:11:00:: with the presentation---presentation%1:04:01:: of a $ 2500 diamond---diamond%1:21:00:: stickpin---stickpin%1:06:00:: .
There was a brief interruption---interruption%1:04:00:: while one of O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: 's men---men%1:14:00:: jerked out both his guns---gun%1:06:00:: and threatened to shoot a waiter---waiter%1:18:00:: who was pestering him for a tip---tip%1:21:00:: .
Then O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: was presented with a platinum---platinum%1:27:00:: watch---watch%1:06:00:: set with rubies---ruby%1:21:00:: and diamonds---diamond%1:21:00:: .
This dinner---dinner%1:14:00:: was the start---start%1:11:00:: of a new blatancy---blatancy%1:07:00:: in the relationship---relationship%1:26:01:: between the gangs---gang%1:14:01:: and the politicians---politician%1:18:00:: , which , prior to 1924 , says Pasley---person%1:03:00:: , `` had been maintained with more or less stealth---stealth%1:04:00:: '' , but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings---gathering%1:04:00:: , denounced by a clergyman---clergyman%1:18:00:: as `` Belshazzar---belshazzar%1:18:00:: feasts '' , at which `` politicians---politician%1:18:00:: fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters---gangster%1:18:00:: , openly , in the big downtown hotels---hotel%1:06:00:: '' .
Pasley---person%1:03:00:: continued : `` They became an institution---institution%1:09:00:: of the Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: scene---scene%1:26:00:: and marked the way---way%1:04:02:: to the moral and financial collapse---collapse%1:11:00:: of the municipal and county governments---government%1:14:00:: in 1928 - 29 '' .
However , this inaugural feast---feast%1:14:00:: did its sponsors---sponsor%1:18:00:: no good whatever .
O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: accepted his platinum---platinum%1:27:00:: watch---watch%1:06:00:: and the tributes---tribute%1:10:01:: to his loyalty---loyalty%1:07:00:: , and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal---deal%1:10:00:: .
On Election Day---election_day%1:28:00:: - November---november%1:28:00:: 4 - he energetically marshalled his force---force%1:14:00:: of bludgeon---bludgeon%1:06:00:: men---man%1:18:00:: , bribers---briber%1:18:00:: , and experts---expert%1:18:00:: in forging repeat---repeat%1:11:00:: votes---vote%1:04:00:: .
The result---result%1:19:00:: was a landslide---landslide%1:11:01:: for the Republican candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: .
This further demonstration---demonstration%1:04:00:: of O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: 's ballooning power---power%1:07:00:: did not please Torrio---person%1:03:00:: and Capone---person%1:03:00:: .
In the past year---year%1:28:01:: there had been too many examples---example%1:09:00:: of his euphoric self-confidence---self-confidence%1:09:00:: and self aggrandisement---self-aggrandisement%1:04:00:: for their liking---liking%1:12:00:: .
He behaved publicly with a cocky , swaggering truculence---truculence%1:07:00:: that offended their vulpine Latin minds---mind%1:09:00:: , and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence---insolence%1:07:00:: that enraged them beneath their blandness---blandness%1:07:02:: .
They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado---bravado%1:10:00:: - as , when his bodyguard---bodyguard%1:18:00:: , Yankee Schwartz---person%1:03:00:: , complained that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller---person%1:03:00:: , a prize-fight---prizefight%1:11:00:: referee---referee%1:18:00:: , chieftain---chieftain%1:18:01:: of a Jewish gang---gang%1:14:01:: and one of four brothers---brother%1:18:00:: of tough reputation---reputation%1:26:01:: , who were Hirschey---person%1:03:00:: , a gambler---gambler%1:18:00:: politician---politician%1:18:00:: in loose beer---beer%1:13:00:: running league---league%1:14:00:: with Torrio---person%1:03:00:: and O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: , Frank---person%1:03:00:: , a policeman---policeman%1:18:00:: , and Max---person%1:03:00:: , the youngest .
To settle this slight---slight%1:04:00:: , O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: went down to the La Salle Theatre---group%1:03:00:: in the Loop---location%1:03:00:: , where , he had learned , Dave Miller---person%1:03:00:: was attending the opening---opening%1:11:00:: of a musical comedy---musical_comedy%1:10:00:: .
At the end---end%1:11:00:: of the performance---performance%1:10:00:: , Dave---person%1:03:00:: and Max---person%1:03:00:: came out into the brilliantly lit foyer---foyer%1:06:00:: among a surge---surge%1:11:00:: of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters---first-nighter%1:18:00:: .
O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: drew his guns---gun%1:06:00:: and fired at Dave---person%1:03:00:: , severely wounding him in the stomach---stomach%1:08:01:: .
A second bullet---bullet%1:06:00:: ricocheted off Max---person%1:03:00:: 's belt buckle---belt_buckle%1:06:00:: , leaving him unhurt but in some distress---distress%1:12:02:: .
O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: tucked away his gun---gun%1:06:00:: and walked out of the theatre---theatre%1:06:00:: ; he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested .
That sort---sort%1:09:00:: of braggadocio---braggadocio%1:10:00:: , for that sort---sort%1:09:00:: of reason---reason%1:16:00:: , in the view---view%1:09:02:: of Torrio---person%1:03:00:: and Capone---person%1:03:00:: , was a nonsense---nonsense%1:10:00:: .
A further example---example%1:09:00:: of the incompatible difference---difference%1:07:00:: in personalities---personality%1:07:00:: was when two policemen---policeman%1:18:00:: held up a Torrio---person%1:03:00:: beer---beer%1:13:00:: convoy---convoy%1:14:00:: on a West Side---location%1:03:00:: street---street%1:06:00:: and demanded $ 300 to let it through .
One of the beer---beer%1:13:00:: runners---runner%1:18:01:: telephoned O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: - on a line---line%1:06:07:: tapped by the detective---detective%1:18:00:: bureau---bureau%1:14:00:: - and reported the situation---situation%1:26:01:: .
O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: 's reaction---reaction%1:09:00:: was :
`` Three hundred dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: !
To them bums---bum%1:18:02:: ?
Upon which the detective---detective%1:18:00:: bureau---bureau%1:14:00:: despatched rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: squads---squad%1:14:00:: to prevent trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: if O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: should send his gunmen---gunman%1:18:00:: out to deal with the hijacking policemen---policeman%1:18:00:: .
But in the meantime the beer---beer%1:13:00:: runner---runner%1:18:01:: , unhappy with this solution---solution%1:09:00:: , telephoned Torrio---person%1:03:00:: and returned to O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: with the message---message%1:10:01:: : `` Say , Dionie---person%1:03:00:: , I just been talking to Johnny---person%1:03:00:: , and he said to let them cops---cop%1:18:00:: have the three hundred .
He says he do n't want no trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: '' .
But Torrio---person%1:03:00:: and Capone---person%1:03:00:: had graver cause---cause%1:10:00:: to hate and distrust the Irishman---irishman%1:18:00:: .
For three years---year%1:28:01:: , since the liquor---liquor%1:13:00:: territorial conference---conference%1:14:00:: , Torrio---person%1:03:00:: had , with his elastic patience---patience%1:07:00:: , and because he knew that retaliation---retaliation%1:04:00:: could cause only violent warfare---warfare%1:04:00:: and disaster---disaster%1:26:00:: to business---business%1:04:02:: , tolerated O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: 's impudent double-crossing---double-crossing%1:04:00:: .
They had suffered , in sulky silence---silence%1:07:01:: , the sight---sight%1:10:00:: of his sharp practice---practice%1:04:00:: in Cicero---location%1:03:00:: .
When , as a diplomatic gesture---gesture%1:04:02:: of amity---amity%1:07:00:: and in payment---payment%1:04:00:: for the loan---loan%1:21:00:: of gunmen---gunman%1:18:00:: in the April---april%1:28:00:: election---election%1:04:01:: , Torrio---person%1:03:00:: had given O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: a slice---slice%1:21:00:: of Cicero---location%1:03:00:: , the profits---profits%1:21:01:: from that district---district%1:15:00:: had been $ 20000 a month---month%1:28:01:: .
In six months---month%1:28:00:: O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: had boosted the profits---profits%1:21:01:: to $ 100000 a month---month%1:28:01:: - mainly by bringing pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: to bear on fifty Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: speak-easy---speakeasy%1:06:00:: proprietors---proprietor%1:18:00:: to shift out to the suburb---suburb%1:15:00:: .
These booze---booze%1:13:00:: customers---customer%1:18:00:: had until then---then%1:28:00:: been buying their supplies from the Sheldon---person%1:03:00:: , Saltis-McErlane---person%1:03:00:: , and Druggan-Lake---person%1:03:00:: gangs---gang%1:14:01:: , and now they were competing for trade---trade%1:04:01:: with the Torrio-Capone---person%1:03:00:: saloons---saloon%1:06:00:: ; once again O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: 's brash recklessness---recklessness%1:07:00:: had caused a proliferation---proliferation%1:22:00:: of ill will---ill_will%1:12:00:: .
The revenue---revenue%1:21:01:: from O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: 's Cicero---location%1:03:00:: territory---territory%1:15:00:: went up still higher , until the yield---yield%1:21:00:: was more than the Torrio-Capone---person%1:03:00:: takings---takings%1:21:00:: from the far bigger trade---trade%1:04:01:: area---area%1:26:00:: of Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: 's South---location%1:03:00:: and West Sides---location%1:03:00:: .
But he still showed no intention---intention%1:09:00:: of sharing with the syndicate---syndicate%1:14:01:: .
At last , even the controlled Torrio---person%1:03:00:: was unable to hold still , and he tentatively suggested that O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: should take a percentage---percentage%1:21:00:: in the Stickney---location%1:03:00:: brothels---brothel%1:06:00:: in return for one from his Cicero---location%1:03:00:: beer---beer%1:13:00:: concession---concession%1:10:00:: .
O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: 's reply---reply%1:10:01:: was a raucous laugh---laugh%1:10:00:: and a flat refusal---refusal%1:10:01:: .
Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O ' Banion gang 's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car load---load%1:06:02:: of Canadian whisky worth $ 100000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition era - the Sibley warehouse robbery , which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation .
Still more jealous bitterness---bitterness%1:12:00:: was engendered by the O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: gang---gang%1:14:01:: 's seizure---seizure%1:04:01:: from a West Side---location%1:03:00:: marshalling yard---marshalling_yard%1:06:00:: of a freight-car---freight_car%1:06:00:: load---load%1:23:00:: of Canadian whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: worth $ 100000 and by one of the biggest coups---coup%1:04:01:: of the Prohibition era---prohibition_era%1:28:00:: - the Sibley---location%1:03:00:: warehouse---warehouse%1:06:00:: robbery---robbery%1:04:00:: , which became famous for the cool brazenness---brazenness%1:07:00:: of the operation---operation%1:04:03:: .
Here was stored $ 1000000 worth---worth%1:23:00:: of bonded whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: .
These 1750 cases---case%1:23:00:: were carted off in a one night---night%1:28:02:: operation---operation%1:04:03:: by the O ' Banion---person%1:03:00:: men---men%1:14:00:: , who left in their stead---stead%1:04:00:: the same number---number%1:07:00:: of barrels---barrel%1:06:00:: filled with water---water%1:27:00:: .
In sentences---sentence%1:10:00:: , patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: of stress---stress%1:10:01:: are determined by complex combinations---combination%1:14:00:: of influences---influence%1:09:00:: that can only be suggested here .
The tendency---tendency%1:09:00:: is toward putting dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: at the end---end%1:09:00:: .
There is a parallel---parallel%1:07:00:: to this tendency---tendency%1:09:00:: in the assignment---assignment%1:04:02:: of time---time%1:07:01:: in long known hymn---hymn%1:10:00:: tunes---tune%1:10:00:: .
Thus the first lines---line%1:10:02:: of one of Charles Wesley---person%1:03:00:: 's hymns---hymn%1:10:00:: are as follows .
`` A charge---charge%1:04:03:: to keep I have , A God---god%1:18:00:: to glorify '' .
In the tune---tune%1:10:00:: to which this hymn---hymn%1:10:00:: is most often sung , `` Boylston '' , the syllables---syllable%1:10:00:: have and fy , ending their lines---line%1:10:02:: , have twice the time---time%1:28:05:: any other syllables---syllable%1:10:00:: have .
Dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: is of course more than extended duration---duration%1:07:00:: , and normally centers on syllables---syllable%1:10:00:: that would have primary stress---stress%1:10:01:: or phrase---phrase%1:10:01:: stress---stress%1:10:01:: if the words---word%1:10:00:: or longer units---unit%1:24:00:: they are parts---part%1:24:00:: of were spoken alone : a dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable---syllable%1:10:00:: rather than its last .
Dominant stress is of course more than extended duration , and normally centers on syllables that would have primary stress or phrase---phrase%1:10:00:: stress if the words or longer units they are parts of were spoken alone : a dominant stress given to glorify would normally center on its first syllable rather than its last .
But the parallel---parallel%1:07:00:: is significant .
When the answer---answer%1:10:01:: to what 's wrong now ?
is Bill---person%1:03:00:: 's broken a chair---chair%1:06:00:: , dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: will usually be on the complement---complement%1:10:00:: a chair---chair%1:06:00:: .
From the point of view---point_of_view%1:09:00:: of syntactic analysis---analysis%1:09:00:: the head word---word%1:10:00:: in the statement---statement%1:10:00:: is the predicator---predicator%1:10:00:: has broken , and from the point of view---point_of_view%1:09:00:: of meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: it would seem that the trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: centers in the breaking---breaking%1:04:00:: ; but dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: will be assigned to broken only in rather exceptional versions---version%1:09:01:: of the sentence---sentence%1:10:00:: .
In I know one thing---thing%1:10:00:: dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: will usually be on the complement---complement%1:10:00:: one thing---thing%1:10:00:: ; in one thing---thing%1:10:00:: I know it will usually be on the predicator---predicator%1:10:00:: know .
In small-town---small_town%1:14:00:: people---people%1:14:00:: are very friendly dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: will generally be on the complement---complement%1:10:00:: very friendly ; in the double sentence---sentence%1:10:00:: the smaller the town---town%1:15:00:: , the friendlier the people---people%1:14:00:: it will generally be on the subjects---subject%1:10:01:: the town---town%1:15:00:: and the people---people%1:14:00:: .
In what 's a linguist---linguist%1:18:01:: ?
dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: will generally be on the subject---subject%1:10:01:: a linguist---linguist%1:18:01:: ; in who 's a linguist---linguist%1:18:01:: ?
it will generally be on the complement---complement%1:10:00:: a linguist---linguist%1:18:01:: .
Dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: is on her luggage---luggage%1:06:00:: both in that 's her luggage---luggage%1:06:00:: , where her luggage---luggage%1:06:00:: is the complement---complement%1:10:00:: , and in there 's her luggage---luggage%1:06:00:: , where it is the subject---subject%1:10:01:: .
Adverbial second complements---complement%1:10:00:: , however , are likely not to have dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: when they terminate sentences---sentence%1:10:00:: .
If the answer---answer%1:10:01:: to what was that noise---noise%1:11:00:: ?
is George---person%1:03:00:: put the cat---cat%1:05:00:: out , dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: will ordinarily be on the first complement---complement%1:10:00:: , the cat---cat%1:05:00:: , not the second complement---complement%1:10:00:: out .
Final adjuncts---adjunct%1:17:00:: may or may not have dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: .
If the answer---answer%1:10:01:: to what was that noise---noise%1:11:00:: ?
is George---person%1:03:00:: reads the news---news%1:10:01:: emotionally , dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: may or may not be on the adjunct---adjunct%1:17:00:: emotionally .
When prepositional complements---complement%1:10:00:: are divided as in what are you looking for ?
they are likely to lose dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: .
Context---context%1:10:00:: is of extreme importance---importance%1:07:00:: .
What is new in the context---context%1:10:00:: is likely to be made more prominent than what is not .
Thus in a context---context%1:10:00:: in which there has been discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: of snow---snow%1:19:00:: but mention---mention%1:10:01:: of local conditions---condition%1:26:00:: is new , dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: will probably be on here in it rarely snows here , but in a context---context%1:10:00:: in which there has been discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: of local weather---weather%1:19:00:: but no mention---mention%1:10:01:: of snow---snow%1:19:00:: , dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: will probably be on snows .
The personal pronouns---personal_pronoun%1:10:00:: and substitute---substitute%1:09:00:: one are normally unstressed because they refer to what is prominent in the immediate context---context%1:10:00:: .
In I 'll go with George---person%1:03:00:: dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: is probably on George---person%1:03:00:: ; but if George---person%1:03:00:: has just been mentioned prominently ( and the trip---trip%1:04:00:: to be made has been under discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: ) , what is said is probably I 'll go with him , and dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: is probably on the preposition---preposition%1:10:00:: with .
When a gesture---gesture%1:10:00:: accompanies who 's he ?
the personal pronoun---personal_pronoun%1:10:00:: has dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: because `` he '' has not been mentioned previously .
If both George---person%1:03:00:: and a piece---piece%1:11:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: George---person%1:03:00:: does not have are prominent in the context---context%1:10:00:: , but the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of telling George---person%1:03:00:: is new , then dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: will probably be on tell in why not tell George---person%1:03:00:: ?
But when what is new in a particular context---context%1:10:00:: is also fairly obvious , there is normally only light stress---stress%1:10:01:: or no stress---stress%1:10:01:: at all .
Thus the unstressed it of it rarely snows here gets its significance---significance%1:07:00:: from its use---use%1:04:00:: with snows : nothing can snow snow---snow%1:19:00:: but `` it '' .
In there are n't many young people---people%1:14:00:: in the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:14:00:: the modifier---modifier%1:10:00:: young takes dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: away from its head---head%1:10:03:: people---people%1:14:00:: : the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that the young creatures---creature%1:03:00:: of interest---interest%1:07:02:: are people---people%1:14:00:: seems rather obvious .
If women---woman%1:18:00:: replaced people---people%1:14:00:: , it would normally have dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: .
In I have things---thing%1:04:00:: to do the word---word%1:10:00:: things---thing%1:04:00:: makes little real contribution---contribution%1:04:02:: to meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: and has weaker stress---stress%1:10:01:: than do .
If work---work%1:04:00:: is substituted for things---thing%1:04:00:: ( with more exact contribution---contribution%1:04:02:: to meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: ) , it will have dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: .
In I know one thing---thing%1:10:00:: dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: is likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing---thing%1:10:00:: .
In I knew you when you were a child---child%1:18:00:: , and you were pretty then dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: on then implies that the young woman---young_woman%1:18:00:: spoken to is still pretty .
Dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: on pretty would be almost insulting here .
In the written language---written_language%1:10:00:: then can be underlined or italicized to guide the reader---reader%1:18:00:: here , but much of the time---time%1:11:00:: the written language---written_language%1:10:00:: simply depends on the reader---reader%1:18:00:: 's alertness---alertness%1:09:00:: , and a careless reader---reader%1:18:00:: will have to back up and reread .
Often dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: simply indicates a centering---centering%1:09:00:: of attention---attention%1:09:00:: or emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: .
Thus in it 's incredible what that boy---boy%1:18:00:: can eat dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: is likely to be on incredible , and eat will have strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: also .
In she has it in for George---person%1:03:00:: dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: will ordinarily be on in , where the notion---notion%1:09:00:: of stored up antipathy---antipathy%1:12:00:: seems to center .
In we 're painting at our garage---garage%1:06:00:: strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: on at indicates that the job---job%1:04:01:: being done is not real painting---painting%1:04:02:: but simply an effort---effort%1:04:00:: at painting---painting%1:04:02:: .
Where there is comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: or contrast---contrast%1:04:00:: dominant stresses---stress%1:10:01:: normally operate to center attention---attention%1:09:00:: .
Thus in his friends---friend%1:18:00:: are stranger than his sisters---sister%1:18:00:: ' strong stresses---stress%1:10:01:: are normal for his and sisters---sister%1:18:00:: ' , but in his friends---friend%1:18:00:: are stranger than his sisters---sister%1:18:00:: strong stresses---stress%1:10:01:: are normal for friends---friend%1:18:00:: and sisters---sister%1:18:00:: .
In he 's hurting himself more than he 's hurting you both himself and you have stronger stress---stress%1:10:01:: than they would ordinarily have if there were no contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: .
the desire---desire%1:07:00:: to contrast the first parts---part%1:24:00:: of words---word%1:10:00:: which are alike in their last components---component%1:06:00:: produces an exceptional disregard---disregard%1:09:00:: of the normal patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: of stress---stress%1:10:01:: of Chinese and Japanese .
Sometimes strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: serves to focus an important secondary relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: .
Thus in Mary---person%1:03:00:: wrote an account---account%1:10:00:: of the trip---trip%1:04:00:: first strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: on Mary---person%1:03:00:: marks Mary---person%1:03:00:: as the first---first%1:23:00:: in a series---series%1:14:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: who wrote accounts---account%1:10:00:: of the trip---trip%1:04:00:: , strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: on wrote marks the writing---writing%1:04:02:: as the first---first%1:24:00:: of a series---series%1:14:00:: of actions---action%1:04:02:: of Mary---person%1:03:00:: 's concerned with an account---account%1:10:00:: of her trip---trip%1:04:00:: ( about which she may later have made speeches---speech%1:10:01:: , for example ) , and strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: on trip---trip%1:04:00:: makes the trip---trip%1:04:00:: the first---first%1:24:00:: of a series---series%1:14:00:: of subjects---subject%1:10:00:: about which Mary---person%1:03:00:: wrote accounts---account%1:10:00:: .
In hunger---hunger%1:26:00:: stimulates man---man%1:05:01:: too the situation---situation%1:26:00:: is very similar .
Strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: on hunger---hunger%1:26:00:: treats hunger---hunger%1:26:00:: as an additional stimulus---stimulus%1:09:00:: , strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: on stimulates treats stimulation---stimulation%1:04:00:: as an additional effect---effect%1:19:00:: of hunger---hunger%1:26:00:: , strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: on man---man%1:05:01:: treats man---man%1:05:01:: as an additional creature---creature%1:03:00:: who responds to the stimulation---stimulation%1:09:00:: of hunger---hunger%1:26:00:: .
Here again , in the written language---written_language%1:10:00:: it is possible to help the reader---reader%1:18:00:: get his stresses---stress%1:10:01:: right by using underlining or italics---italic%1:10:02:: , but much of the time---time%1:11:00:: there is simply reliance---reliance%1:26:00:: on his understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: in the light---light%1:09:01:: of context---context%1:10:00:: .
When a word---word%1:10:00:: represents a larger construction---construction%1:10:01:: of which it is the only expressed part---part%1:24:00:: , it normally has more stress---stress%1:10:01:: than it would have in fully expressed construction---construction%1:10:01:: .
Thus when yes , I have is the response---response%1:10:01:: to have you finished reading the paper---paper%1:10:03:: ?
the stress---stress%1:10:01:: on have , which here represents have finished reading the paper---paper%1:10:03:: , is quite strong .
In Mack---person%1:03:00:: 's the leader---leader%1:18:00:: at camp , but Jack---person%1:03:00:: is here the is of the second main declarative represents is the leader---leader%1:18:00:: and therefore has stress---stress%1:10:01:: .
Mack---person%1:03:00:: 's the leader---leader%1:18:00:: at camp , but Jack---person%1:03:00:: 's here , with this is deprived of stress---stress%1:10:01:: , makes here the complement---complement%1:10:00:: in the clause---clause%1:10:00:: .
In of all the suggestions---suggestion%1:10:00:: that were made , his was the silliest the possessive his represents his suggestion---suggestion%1:10:00:: and is stressed .
When go represents itself and a complement---complement%1:10:00:: ( being equivalent , say , to go to Martinique---location%1:03:00:: ) in which boat---boat%1:06:00:: did Jack---person%1:03:00:: go on ?
it has strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: ; when it represents only itself and on which is its complement---complement%1:10:00:: ( so that go on is semantically equivalent to board ) , on has stronger stress---stress%1:10:01:: than go does .
Omission---omission%1:22:00:: of a subordinator pronoun---pronoun%1:10:00:: , however , does not result in an increase---increase%1:04:00:: in stress---stress%1:10:01:: on a prepositional adverb---adverb%1:10:01:: for which the subordinator pronoun---pronoun%1:10:00:: would be object---object%1:10:00:: .
Thus to has light stress---stress%1:10:01:: both in that was the conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: that I came to and in that was the conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: I came to .
But when to represents to consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: in that was the moment---moment%1:28:00:: that I came to , and similarly in that was the moment---moment%1:28:00:: I came to , there is much stronger stress---stress%1:10:01:: on to .
When I have instructions---instruction%1:10:04:: to leave is equivalent in meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: to I have instructions---instruction%1:10:04:: that I am to leave this place---place%1:15:00:: , dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: is ordinarily on leave .
When the same sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: is equivalent---equivalent%1:09:00:: in meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: to I have instructions---instruction%1:10:04:: which I am to leave , dominant stress---stress%1:10:01:: is ordinarily on instructions---instruction%1:10:04:: .
It is clear that patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: of stress---stress%1:10:01:: sometimes show---show%1:10:03:: construction---construction%1:10:01:: unambiguously in the spoken language---spoken_language%1:10:00:: where without the help---help%1:04:00:: of context---context%1:10:00:: it would be ambiguous in the written .
Other examples---example%1:09:00:: follow .
`` I 'll come by Tuesday---tuesday%1:28:00:: .
I can n't be happy long without drinking---drinking%1:04:00:: water---water%1:27:00:: '' .
In the first---first%1:23:00:: of these sentences---sentence%1:10:00:: if by is the complement---complement%1:10:00:: of come and Tuesday---tuesday%1:28:00:: is an adjunct---adjunct%1:17:00:: of time---time%1:03:00:: equivalent to on Tuesday---tuesday%1:28:00:: , there will be strong stress---stress%1:10:01:: on by in the spoken language---spoken_language%1:10:00:: ; but if a complement---complement%1:10:00:: for come is implied and by Tuesday---tuesday%1:28:00:: is a prepositional unit---unit%1:24:00:: used as an adjunct---adjunct%1:17:00:: , by will be unstressed or lightly stressed at most .
In the second sentence---sentence%1:10:00:: if drinking water---water%1:27:00:: is a gerundial clause---clause%1:10:00:: and without drinking---drinking%1:04:00:: water---water%1:27:00:: is roughly equivalent in meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: to unless I drink water---water%1:27:00:: , there will be stronger stress---stress%1:10:01:: on water---water%1:27:00:: than on drinking ; but if drinking---drinking%1:04:00:: is a gerundial noun---noun%1:10:00:: modifying water---water%1:27:00:: and without drinking water---drinking_water%1:13:00:: is equivalent to without water---water%1:27:00:: for drinking---drinking%1:04:00:: , there will be stronger stress---stress%1:10:01:: on drinking---drinking%1:04:00:: than on water---water%1:27:00:: .
But the use---use%1:04:00:: of stress---stress%1:10:01:: in comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: and contrast---contrast%1:04:00:: , for example , can undermine distinctions---distinction%1:07:00:: such as these .
And patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: of stress---stress%1:10:01:: are not always unambiguous by any means .
In the Steiners---person%1:03:00:: have busy lives---life%1:26:02:: without visiting relatives---relative%1:18:00:: only context---context%1:10:00:: can indicate whether visiting relatives---relative%1:18:00:: is equivalent---equivalent%1:09:00:: in meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: to paying visits---visit%1:04:02:: to relatives---relative%1:18:00:: or to relatives---relative%1:18:00:: who are visiting them , and in I looked up the number---number%1:10:03:: and I looked up the chimney---chimney%1:06:00:: only the meanings---meaning%1:10:00:: of number---number%1:10:03:: and chimney---chimney%1:06:00:: make it clear that up is syntactically a second complement---complement%1:10:00:: in the first sentence---sentence%1:10:00:: and a preposition---preposition%1:10:00:: followed by its object---object%1:10:00:: in the second .
- Syllables are linguistic units centering in peaks which are usually vocalic but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain circumstances , and which may or may not be combined with preceding and / or following consonants---consonant%1:10:01:: or combinations of consonants---consonant%1:10:01:: .
- Syllables---syllable%1:10:00:: are linguistic units---linguistic_unit%1:10:00:: centering in peaks---peak%1:23:00:: which are usually vocalic but , as has been noted , are consonantal under certain circumstances---circumstance%1:26:02:: , and which may or may not be combined with preceding and / or following consonants---consonant%1:10:00:: or combinations---combination%1:14:00:: of consonants---consonant%1:10:00:: .
Syllables---syllable%1:10:00:: are genuine units---unit%1:24:00:: , but division---division%1:04:00:: of words---word%1:10:00:: and sentences---sentence%1:10:00:: into them presents great difficulties---difficulty%1:09:02:: .
Sometimes even the number---number%1:07:00:: of syllables---syllable%1:10:00:: is not clear .
Doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: on this point---point%1:09:01:: is strongest before / l / and / / or / r / .
From the point of view---point_of_view%1:09:00:: of word---word%1:10:00:: formation---formation%1:06:00:: real might be expected to have two syllables---syllable%1:10:00:: .
Historically re is the formative---formative%1:10:00:: that is employed also in republic , and al is the common suffix---suffix%1:10:00:: .
When ity is added , real clearly has two syllables---syllable%1:10:00:: .
But there is every reason---reason%1:10:01:: to regard deal as a monosyllable---monosyllable%1:10:00:: , and because of the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that / l / commonly has the quality---quality%1:07:00:: of / / when it follows vowel sounds---vowel_sound%1:10:00:: , deal seems to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme---rhyme%1:10:00:: with real .
They were west---west%1:24:00:: of the Sabine---sabine%1:17:00:: , but only God knew where .
For three days---day%1:28:00:: , their stolid oxen---oxen%1:05:00:: had plodded up a blazing valley---valley%1:17:00:: as flat and featureless as a dead sea---sea%1:17:00:: .
Molten glare---glare%1:07:00:: singed their eyelids---eyelid%1:08:00:: an angry crimson ; suffocating air---air%1:27:00:: sapped their strength---strength%1:07:00:: and strained their nerves---nerves%1:26:00:: to snapping ; dust---dust%1:27:00:: choked their throats---throat%1:08:00:: and lay like acid---acid%1:27:00:: in their lungs---lung%1:08:00:: .
And the valley---valley%1:17:00:: stretched endlessly out ahead , scorched and baked and writhing in its heat---heat%1:07:01:: , until it vanished into the throbbing wall---wall%1:17:00:: of fiery orange brown haze---haze%1:19:00:: .
Ben Prime---person%1:03:00:: extended his high-stepped stride---stride%1:04:00:: until he could lay his goad---goad%1:06:00:: across the noses---nose%1:08:00:: of the oxen---oxen%1:05:00:: .
`` Hoa-whup '' ! he commanded from his raw throat---throat%1:08:00:: , and felt the pain---pain%1:26:00:: of movement---movement%1:04:04:: in his cracked , black burned lips---lip%1:08:00:: .
He removed his hat---hat%1:06:00:: to let the trapped sweat---sweat%1:08:00:: cut rivulets---rivulet%1:17:00:: through the dust---dust%1:27:00:: film---film%1:06:00:: upon his gaunt face---face%1:08:00:: .
The dust---dust%1:27:00:: thick saliva---saliva%1:08:00:: came from his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: like balled cotton---cotton%1:27:01:: .
He moved back to the wheel---wheel%1:06:00:: and stood there blowing , grasping the top---top%1:15:00:: of a spoke---spoke%1:06:00:: to still the trembling---trembling%1:26:00:: of his played-out limbs---limb%1:08:00:: .
The burning air---air%1:27:00:: dried his sweat---sweat%1:08:00:: soaked clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: in salt---salt%1:27:00:: edged patches---patch%1:07:00:: .
He cleared his throat---throat%1:08:00:: and wet his lips---lip%1:08:00:: .
As cheerfully as possible , he said , `` Well , I guess we could all do with a little drink---drink%1:13:00:: '' .
He unlashed the dipper---dipper%1:06:00:: and drew water---water%1:27:00:: from a barrel---barrel%1:06:00:: .
They could no longer afford the luxury---luxury%1:07:00:: of the canvas---canvas%1:06:00:: sweat bag---sweat_bag%1:06:00:: that cooled it by evaporation---evaporation%1:22:00:: .
The water---water%1:27:00:: was warm and stale and had a brackish taste---taste%1:09:02:: .
But it was water---water%1:27:00:: .
Thank the Lord , they still had water---water%1:27:00:: !
He cleansed his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: with a small quantity---quantity%1:03:00:: .
He took a long but carefully controlled draught---draught%1:04:01:: .
He replenished the dipper---dipper%1:06:00:: and handed it to his young wife---wife%1:18:00:: riding the hurricane deck---hurricane_deck%1:06:00:: .
She took it grudgingly , her dark eyes---eye%1:08:00:: baleful as they met his .
She drank and pushed back her gingham---gingham%1:06:00:: bonnet---bonnet%1:06:00:: to wet a kerchief---kerchief%1:06:00:: and wipe her face---face%1:08:00:: .
She set the dipper---dipper%1:06:00:: on the edge---edge%1:06:01:: of the deck---deck%1:06:00:: , leaving it for him to stretch after it while she looked on scornfully .
`` What happens when there 's no more water---water%1:27:00:: '' ? she asked smolderingly .
She was like charcoal---charcoal%1:27:00:: , he thought - dark , opaque , explosive .
Her thick hair---hair%1:08:00:: was the color---color%1:07:00:: and texture---texture%1:07:00:: of charcoal---charcoal%1:27:00:: .
Her temper---temper%1:07:02:: sparked like charcoal---charcoal%1:27:00:: when it first lights up .
And all the time , she had the heat---heat%1:07:02:: of hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: in her , like charcoal---charcoal%1:27:00:: that is burning on its under side---underside%1:15:00:: , but not visibly .
A ripple---ripple%1:11:00:: ran through the muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: of his jaws---jaw%1:08:00:: , but he kept control---control%1:07:00:: upon his voice---voice%1:10:00:: .
`` There must be some water---water%1:27:00:: under there '' .
He tilted his homely face---face%1:08:00:: toward the dry bed---bed%1:17:00:: of the river---river%1:17:00:: .
`` And add fever---fever%1:26:00:: to our troubles '' ? she scoffed .
`` Or do you want to see if I can stand fever---fever%1:26:00:: , too '' ?
Her chin---chin%1:08:00:: sharpened .
`` The tires---tire%1:06:00:: are rattling on the wheels---wheel%1:06:00:: now .
They 'll roll off in another day---day%1:28:00:: .
There was no valley---valley%1:17:00:: like this on your map---map%1:06:00:: .
`` Hettie---person%1:03:00:: '' , he said as gently as he could , `` we 're still headed west .
Somewhere , we 'll hit a trail---trail%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Maybe in time to make a cross---cross%1:06:01:: and dig our graves---grave%1:06:00:: '' .
His wide mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: compressed .
He had picked out this pathless trail---trail%1:06:00:: , instead of the common one , in a moment---moment%1:28:00:: of romantic fancy---fancy%1:09:02:: , to give them privacy---privacy%1:26:02:: on their honeymoon---honeymoon%1:28:00:: .
It had been a mistake---mistake%1:04:00:: , but anything would have been a mistake---mistake%1:04:00:: , as it turned out .
It was n't the roughness---roughness%1:07:02:: and crudity---crudity%1:26:00:: and discomfort---discomfort%1:26:00:: of the trip---trip%1:04:00:: that had frightened her .
She had hated the whole idea---idea%1:09:00:: before they started .
It had been five days---day%1:28:00:: too late before he learned that she 'd gone through the wedding ceremony---wedding_ceremony%1:11:00:: in a semitrance---semitrance%1:09:00:: of laudanum---laudanum%1:06:00:: , administered by her mother---mother%1:18:00:: .
The bitterness---bitterness%1:12:00:: of their wedding night---wedding_night%1:28:00:: still ripped within him like an open wound---wound%1:26:00:: .
She had jumped away from his shy touch---touch%1:11:00:: like a cat---cat%1:05:00:: confronted by a sidewinder---sidewinder%1:05:00:: .
He had left her inviolate , thinking familiarity---familiarity%1:07:02:: would gentle her in time .
But each mile---mile%1:23:01:: westward , she had hated him the deeper .
He stared at the dipper---dipper%1:06:00:: , turning it over and over in his wide , calloused hands---hand%1:08:00:: .
`` I suppose '' , he muttered , `` I can sell the outfit---outfit%1:06:00:: for enough---enough%1:23:00:: to send you home to your folks---folk%1:14:02:: , once we find a settlement---settlement%1:14:00:: '' .
Her laugh---laugh%1:10:00:: was hard .
`` They would n't have sold me in the first place if there 'd been food---food%1:03:00:: enough to go around '' .
`` Hettie---person%1:03:00:: , they did n't sell you '' , he said miserably .
`` They knew I was a good sharecrop farmer---sharecrop_farmer%1:18:00:: back in Carolina---location%1:03:00:: , but out West---west%1:15:01:: was a chance---chance%1:26:00:: to build a real farm---farm%1:06:00:: of our own .
They thought it would be a chance---chance%1:26:00:: for you to make a life---life%1:26:02:: out where nobody will be thought any better than the next except for just what 's inside of them .
Without money---money%1:21:00:: or property---property%1:21:00:: , what would you have had at Baton Rouge---baton_rouge%1:15:00:: '' ?
`` I might have starved , but at least I would n't be fried to a crisp---crisp%1:13:00:: and soaked with dirt---dirt%1:26:00:: '' !
He darkened under his heavy burn---burn%1:26:02:: .
His blue eyes---eye%1:08:00:: sought the shimmering sea---sea%1:17:00:: of haze---haze%1:19:00:: ahead .
To his puzzlement---puzzlement%1:09:00:: , there suddenly was no haze---haze%1:19:00:: .
The valley---valley%1:17:00:: lay clear , and open to the eye---eye%1:08:00:: , right up to the sharp limbed line---line%1:14:01:: of gaunt , scoured hills that formed the horizon---horizon%1:15:00:: twenty miles---mile%1:23:01:: ahead .
Then he noticed the clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: racing upon them - heavy , ominous , leaden clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: that formed even as they sliced over the crests---crest%1:15:01:: of the surrounding hills .
He had never seen clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: like them before , but he had the primitive feel---feel%1:09:00:: of danger---danger%1:26:00:: that gripped a man---man%1:18:04:: before a hurricane---hurricane%1:19:00:: in Carolina---location%1:03:00:: .
He hollered hoarsely , `` Hang on '' ! and goaded the oxen---oxen%1:05:00:: as he yelled .
He wanted to turn them , putting the wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: against the storm---storm%1:19:00:: .
Too late , he realized that in turning---turning%1:04:00:: , he had wheeled them onto a patch---patch%1:15:00:: of sandy ground---ground%1:27:00:: , instead of atop a grade---grade%1:07:01:: or ridge---ridge%1:17:00:: .
He swung up over the wheel---wheel%1:06:00:: .
But she sat on in stubborn silence---silence%1:07:01:: .
The clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: bulged downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel---funnel%1:25:00:: .
Frozen , they stared at it whirling down the valley---valley%1:17:00:: , gouging and spitting out boulders---boulder%1:17:00:: and chunks---chunk%1:14:00:: of earth---earth%1:27:00:: like a starving hound dog---hound_dog%1:05:00:: cracking marrowbones---marrowbone%1:13:00:: .
The six ton---ton%1:23:02:: Conestoga---conestoga_wagon%1:06:00:: began to whip and shake .
Their world---world%1:09:00:: turned black .
It was filled with dust---dust%1:27:00:: and wind---wind%1:19:00:: and sound---sound%1:07:00:: and violence---violence%1:07:00:: .
The heavens opened , pelting them with hail---hail%1:19:00:: the size---size%1:07:00:: of walnuts---walnut%1:13:00:: .
And then came the water---water%1:27:00:: - not rain---rain%1:27:00:: , but solid sheets---sheet%1:17:00:: that sluiced down like water---water%1:27:00:: slopping from a bucket---bucket%1:06:00:: .
Walls---wall%1:17:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: rushed down the slopes---slope%1:17:00:: and filled the hollows---hollow%1:17:01:: like the crests---crest%1:15:00:: of flash floods---flash_flood%1:19:00:: .
Through the splash---splash%1:11:00:: of the rising waters---water%1:27:00:: , they could hear the roar---roar%1:11:00:: of the river---river%1:17:00:: as it raged through its canyon---canyon%1:17:00:: , gnashing big chunks---chunk%1:14:00:: out of the banks---bank%1:17:01:: .
The jetting , frothing surface---surface%1:15:00:: of the river---river%1:17:00:: reached the level---level%1:07:01:: of the runoff---runoff%1:11:00:: .
The dangerous current---current%1:11:00:: upon the prairie---prairie%1:15:00:: ceased , but the water---water%1:27:00:: stood and kept on rising .
They cringed under sodden covers---cover%1:06:01:: , listening to the waves---wave%1:11:01:: slop against the bottom---bottom%1:15:00:: .
The cloudburst---cloudburst%1:19:00:: cut off abruptly .
They were engulfed by the weird silence---silence%1:07:00:: , broken only by the low , angry murmur---murmur%1:11:00:: of the river---river%1:17:00:: .
Then the darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: thinned , and there was light---light%1:19:00:: again , and then bright sunlight---sunlight%1:19:00:: .
Beaten with fear---fear%1:12:00:: and sound---sound%1:07:00:: and wet---wet%1:26:00:: and chill---chill%1:07:00:: , they crawled to the hurricane deck---hurricane_deck%1:06:00:: and looked out haggardly at a world---world%1:09:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: that reached clear to the surrounding hills .
The water level---water_level%1:07:00:: was higher than their hubs---hub%1:06:00:: .
Only the heavy bones---bone%1:27:00:: of the oxen---oxen%1:05:00:: kept them anchored .
There was no real sign---sign%1:10:05:: of the river---river%1:17:00:: now , just a roiling , oily ribbon---ribbon%1:17:00:: of liquid movement---movement%1:11:00:: through muddy waters---water%1:27:00:: that reached everywhere .
Clumps---clump%1:14:01:: of brush---brush%1:14:00:: rode down the ribbon---ribbon%1:17:00:: .
Now and then , the glistening side---side%1:15:00:: of a half swamped object---object%1:03:00:: showed as it swept past .
The girl---girl%1:18:00:: crawled out into the renewing warmth---warmth%1:09:00:: of the sunshine---sunshine%1:19:00:: , hugging her shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: and still trembling .
Her face---face%1:08:00:: was pale but set and her dark eyes---eye%1:08:00:: smoldered with blame---blame%1:10:01:: for Ben .
Out of compulsion---compulsion%1:04:00:: to say something cheery , Ben Prime blurted , `` Well , we were lucky to be on soft ground---ground%1:17:00:: when the first floodheads---floodhead%1:19:00:: hit .
At least , the wheels---wheel%1:06:00:: dug in .
The soaking---soaking%1:22:00:: will put life---life%1:07:01:: back in the wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: , too '' .
His wife---wife%1:18:00:: did n't give a sign---sign%1:10:05:: she 'd heard .
She was watching a tree---tree%1:20:00:: ride wildly down that roiling current---current%1:11:00:: .
Somebody was riding the tree---tree%1:20:00:: .
It raced closer and they could see a woman---woman%1:18:00:: with white hair---hair%1:08:00:: , sitting astride an upright branch---branch%1:20:00:: .
But as the tree---tree%1:20:00:: passed , she lifted an arm---arm%1:08:00:: in gesture---gesture%1:10:00:: of better luck---luck%1:26:00:: and farewell---farewell%1:10:00:: .
They watched the tree---tree%1:20:00:: until it twisted sharply on a bend---bend%1:25:02:: .
It speared up into the air , then sinking back , the up jutting branch---branch%1:20:00:: turned slowly .
The pale blob---blob%1:25:00:: of the woman---woman%1:18:00:: disappeared .
`` There 's the one who 's lucky '' ! the girl---girl%1:18:00:: murmured harshly .
Ben 's eyes---eye%1:08:00:: strained with the bitter hurt---hurt%1:12:02:: , his homely face---face%1:08:00:: slashed with gray and crimson .
Then he took off his wet boots---boot%1:06:00:: and dropped down into the water---water%1:27:00:: to talk with the beasts---beast%1:03:00:: , needing their comfort---comfort%1:04:00:: more than they needed his .
It was nearly sundown---sundown%1:28:00:: and he went to the back---back%1:06:00:: of the wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: , half swimming his way---way%1:15:00:: , for he was not a tall man---man%1:18:00:: .
He let down the tailgate---tailgate%1:06:00:: and was knocked over by the sluice---sluice%1:06:00:: of water---water%1:17:00:: .
He sputtered back to his feet---foot%1:08:01:: and scrambled madly to pull his bags---bag%1:06:00:: of seed grain---seed_grain%1:21:00:: forward .
Of all their worldly belongings---worldly_belongings%1:21:00:: , next to the oxen---oxen%1:05:00:: and his gun---gun%1:06:00:: , the seed grain---seed_grain%1:21:00:: had been the most treasured .
It was spoiled now for seed---seed%1:20:00:: , and it would sour and mold in three days---day%1:28:00:: if they failed to find a place---place%1:15:00:: and fuel---fuel%1:27:00:: to dry it .
The oxen---oxen%1:05:00:: might as well enjoy it .
He examined the water marks---watermark%1:15:00:: on the iron---iron%1:27:00:: tires---tire%1:06:00:: when the animals---animal%1:03:00:: were finished .
The waters---water%1:27:00:: lay muddy but placid , without a ripple---ripple%1:11:00:: of movement---movement%1:04:00:: against the wheels---wheel%1:06:00:: ; there was not a match---match%1:06:00:: width---width%1:07:00:: of damp mark---mark%1:10:03:: to show they were receding .
He doubted if a man---man%1:18:04:: could wade as far as the desolate , dry hills that rimmed the valley---valley%1:17:00:: .
A terrible , numbing sense---sense%1:09:05:: of futility---futility%1:07:00:: swept over him .
He gripped the wheel---wheel%1:06:00:: hard to fight the despondency---despondency%1:12:00:: of defeat---defeat%1:12:00:: .
Then he noticed that the dry wood---wood%1:27:00:: of the wheels---wheel%1:06:00:: had swollen .
The spokes---spoke%1:06:00:: were tight again , the iron---iron%1:27:00:: tires---tire%1:06:00:: gripped onto the wheels---wheel%1:06:00:: as if of one piece---piece%1:17:00:: .
Hope---hope%1:12:01:: surged within him .
He swung toward the front---front%1:15:00:: to give the news---news%1:10:00:: to Hettie , then stopped , barred from her by the vehemence---vehemence%1:07:01:: of her blame---blame%1:10:01:: and hate---hate%1:12:00:: .
A tight wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: meant so much---much%1:23:00:: .
He got a small fire---fire%1:11:00:: started and put on bacon---bacon%1:13:00:: and coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: .
He poured the water---water%1:27:00:: off the sourdough---sourdough%1:27:00:: and off the flour---flour%1:13:00:: , salvaging the chunky , watery messes---mess%1:13:01:: for biscuits---biscuit%1:13:00:: of a sort---sort%1:09:00:: .
Their jams---jam%1:13:00:: and jellies---jelly%1:13:00:: had not suffered .
He found a jar---jar%1:06:00:: of preserved tomatoes---tomato%1:13:00:: and one of eggs---eggs%1:13:00:: that they had meant to save .
Now he broke them open , hoping a good meal---meal%1:13:00:: might lessen this depression---depression%1:12:00:: crushing Hettie .
His long nose---nose%1:08:00:: wiggled at the smells---smell%1:09:02:: of frizzling bacon---bacon%1:13:00:: and heating---heating%1:22:00:: java---java%1:13:00:: , but the fire---fire%1:11:00:: was low , and he wanted to waste no time---time%1:28:05:: .
He furled the slashed sides---side%1:06:00:: of the canvas---canvas%1:06:00:: tarpaulins---tarpaulin%1:06:00:: , leaving the ribs---rib%1:06:00:: and wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: open .
He looked thoughtfully at his wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's trunk---trunk%1:06:00:: , holding her meager treasures---treasure%1:14:00:: .
He said hesitantly , `` Hettie , I do n't figure your things---things%1:21:00:: got wet too much .
That 's a good trunk---trunk%1:06:00:: .
She said without turning her head---head%1:08:00:: , `` After that rain---rain%1:27:00:: beating in atop the dust---dust%1:27:00:: , there is n't a thing---thing%1:06:00:: that won n't be streaked '' .
He drew a long breath---breath%1:27:00:: and opened the trunk---trunk%1:06:00:: and hung out her clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: and spoilables upon the wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: ribs---rib%1:06:00:: .
Unemployed older workers---worker%1:18:01:: who have no expectation---expectation%1:26:00:: of securing employment---employment%1:04:00:: in the occupation---occupation%1:04:00:: in which they are skilled should be able to secure counseling---counseling%1:10:00:: and retraining---retraining%1:04:00:: in an occupation---occupation%1:04:00:: with a future---future%1:28:00:: .
Some vocational training schools---training_school%1:14:01:: provide such training---training%1:04:00:: , but the current need---need%1:26:00:: exceeds the facilities---facility%1:06:00:: .
The present Federal program---program%1:09:00:: of vocational education---education%1:04:00:: began in 1917 with the passage---passage%1:04:01:: of the Smith-Hughes Act , which provided a continuing annual appropriation---appropriation%1:21:00:: of $ 7 million to support , on a matching basis---basis%1:24:00:: , state administered programs---program%1:09:00:: of vocational education---education%1:04:00:: in agriculture---agriculture%1:04:01:: , trades---trade%1:04:00:: , industrial skills---skill%1:09:01:: and home economics---home_economics%1:09:00:: .
Since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and related acts---act%1:10:01:: have extended this Federal program---program%1:09:00:: .
The George-Barden Act of 1946 raised the previous increases---increase%1:07:00:: in annual authorizations---authorization%1:10:00:: to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the Smith Act .
The Health Amendment Act of 1956 added $ 5 million for practical nurse---practical_nurse%1:18:00:: training---training%1:04:00:: .
The latest major change---change%1:11:00:: in this program---program%1:09:00:: was introduced by the National Defense Education Act of 1958 , Title---title%1:10:05:: 8 , of which amended the George-Barden Act .
Annual authorizations---authorization%1:10:00:: of $ 15 million were added for area---area%1:15:01:: vocational education---education%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: that meet national defense---defense%1:04:00:: needs---need%1:26:00:: for highly skilled technicians---technician%1:18:00:: .
The Federal program---program%1:09:00:: of vocational education---education%1:04:00:: merely provides financial aid to encourage the establishment---establishment%1:04:00:: of vocational education---education%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: in public schools---school%1:14:00:: .
The initiative---initiative%1:04:00:: , administration---administration%1:04:00:: and control---control%1:07:00:: remain primarily with the local school---school%1:14:00:: districts---district%1:15:00:: .
Even the states---state%1:14:01:: remain primarily in an assisting role---role%1:04:00:: , providing leadership---leadership%1:04:00:: and teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: training---training%1:04:00:: .
Federal assistance---assistance%1:07:00:: is limited to half---half%1:23:00:: of the total expenditure---expenditure%1:21:00:: , and the state---state%1:14:01:: or local districts---district%1:15:00:: must pay at least half---half%1:23:00:: .
The state---state%1:14:01:: may decide to encourage local programs---program%1:09:00:: by paying half---half%1:23:00:: of the cost---cost%1:21:00:: , or the state---state%1:14:01:: may require the local district---district%1:15:00:: to bear this half---half%1:23:00:: or some part---part%1:06:00:: of it .
Throughout the history---history%1:28:00:: of the program---program%1:09:00:: , state government---state_government%1:14:00:: expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: in the aggregate---aggregate%1:06:00:: have usually matched or exceeded the Federal expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: , while local districts---district%1:15:00:: all together have spent more than either Federal or state governments---state_government%1:14:00:: .
Today---today%1:28:00:: , Federal funds---funds%1:21:00:: account for only one-fifth---one-fifth%1:23:00:: of the nation---nation%1:14:00:: 's expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: for vocational education---education%1:04:00:: .
The greatest impact---impact%1:19:00:: of the matching fund---fund%1:21:00:: principle---principle%1:09:00:: has been in initially encouraging the poorest states---state%1:14:01:: and school---school%1:14:00:: districts---district%1:15:00:: to spend enough to obtain their full allocation---allocation%1:21:00:: of outside funds---funds%1:21:00:: .
National defense---defense%1:04:00:: considerations---consideration%1:09:01:: have been the major reason---reason%1:16:00:: behind most Federal training---training%1:04:00:: expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: in recent decades---decade%1:28:00:: .
During World War---world_war%1:04:00:: 2 , about 7.5 million persons---person%1:03:00:: were enrolled in courses---course%1:04:01:: organized under two special programs---program%1:09:00:: administered by state and local school---school%1:14:00:: authorities---authorities%1:14:00:: : ( 1---1%1:23:00:: ) Vocational Education---education%1:04:00:: for National Defense---defense%1:04:00:: , and ( 2---2%1:23:00:: ) War---war%1:26:00:: Production---production%1:04:00:: Training---training%1:04:00:: .
The total cost---cost%1:21:00:: of the five year---year%1:28:01:: program---program%1:09:00:: was $ 297 million .
For the Smith-Hughes , George-Barden , and National Defense Act of 1958 , the cumulative total---total%1:06:00:: of Federal expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: in 42 years---year%1:28:01:: was only about $ 740 million .
No comparable measures are available of enrollments---enrollment%1:04:00:: and expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: for private vocational education---education%1:04:00:: training---training%1:04:00:: .
There are a great number---number%1:07:00:: and variety---variety%1:14:01:: of private commercial schools---school%1:14:00:: , trade schools---trade_school%1:14:00:: and technical schools---technical_school%1:14:00:: .
In addition , many large corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: operate their own formal training programs---training_program%1:09:00:: .
A recent study---study%1:10:00:: indicated that 85 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the nation---nation%1:14:00:: 's largest corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: conducted educational programs---program%1:09:00:: involving some class---class%1:14:03:: meetings---meeting%1:14:00:: and examinations---examination%1:10:00:: .
Most skilled---skilled_worker%1:18:00:: industrial workers , nevertheless , still acquire their skills---skill%1:09:01:: outside of formal training---training%1:04:00:: institutions---institution%1:14:00:: .
The National Manpower Council---group%1:03:00:: of Columbia University---group%1:03:00:: has estimated that three out of five skilled workers---skilled_worker%1:18:00:: and one out of five technicians---technician%1:18:00:: have not been formally trained .
There is little doubt---doubt%1:07:00:: that the students---student%1:18:00:: benefit from vocational education---education%1:04:00:: .
Employers---employer%1:18:00:: prefer to hire youth---youth%1:14:00:: with such training---training%1:04:00:: rather than those without , and most graduates---graduate%1:18:00:: of vocational training---training%1:04:00:: go to work---work%1:04:01:: in jobs---job%1:04:00:: related to their training---training%1:04:00:: .
Vocational educators---educator%1:18:00:: do not claim that school---school%1:14:00:: training---training%1:04:00:: alone makes skilled workers---skilled_worker%1:18:00:: , but it provides the essential groundwork---groundwork%1:09:00:: for developing skills---skill%1:09:01:: .
In most states---state%1:15:01:: , trade---trade%1:04:00:: and industrial training---training%1:04:00:: is provided in a minority---minority%1:07:00:: of the high schools---high_school%1:14:00:: , usually located in the larger cities---city%1:15:00:: .
In Arkansas---arkansas%1:15:00:: fewer than 6 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the high schools---high_school%1:14:00:: offer trade---trade%1:04:00:: and industrial courses---course%1:04:01:: .
In Illinois---illinois%1:15:00:: about 13 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the schools---school%1:14:00:: have programs---program%1:09:00:: , and in Pennsylvania---pennsylvania%1:15:00:: 11 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: .
An important recent trend---trend%1:15:02:: is the development---development%1:22:02:: of area---area%1:15:01:: vocational schools---vocational_school%1:14:00:: .
For a number---number%1:07:00:: of years---year%1:28:01:: Kentucky---kentucky%1:15:00:: , Louisiana---louisiana%1:15:00:: and several other states---state%1:14:01:: have been building state---state%1:14:01:: sponsored vocational education---education%1:04:00:: schools---school%1:14:00:: that serve nearby school---school%1:14:00:: districts---district%1:15:00:: in several counties---county%1:15:00:: .
These schools---school%1:14:00:: are intended to provide the facilities---facility%1:06:00:: and specialized curriculum---curriculum%1:10:00:: that would not be possible for very small school---school%1:14:00:: districts---district%1:15:00:: .
Transportation---transportation%1:04:00:: may be provided from nearby school---school%1:14:00:: districts---district%1:15:00:: .
Courses---course%1:04:01:: are provided mainly for post high school---high_school%1:14:00:: day---day%1:28:02:: programs---program%1:09:00:: ; but sometimes arrangements---arrangement%1:09:01:: also are made for high school---high_school%1:14:00:: students---student%1:18:00:: to attend , and evening---evening%1:28:00:: extension---extension%1:04:00:: courses---course%1:04:01:: also may be conducted .
The Title---title%1:10:05:: 8 , program---program%1:09:00:: of the National Defense Education Act of 1958 was a great spur---spur%1:10:00:: to this trend---trend%1:15:02:: toward area---area%1:15:01:: schools---school%1:14:00:: .
By 1960 there were such schools---school%1:14:00:: in all but 4 states---state%1:15:01:: .
They were operating in 10 of the 17 major areas---area%1:15:01:: of chronic labor---labor%1:14:00:: surplus---surplus%1:07:00:: and in 10 of the minor areas---area%1:15:01:: .
An extension---extension%1:04:02:: of this program---program%1:09:00:: into the other distressed areas---area%1:15:01:: should be undertaken .
Some of this trend---trend%1:15:02:: toward area---area%1:15:01:: vocational schools---vocational_school%1:14:00:: has been related to the problems---problem%1:26:00:: of persistent labor---labor%1:14:00:: surplus---surplus%1:07:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: and their desire---desire%1:07:00:: to attract new industry---industry%1:14:00:: .
The major training---training%1:04:00:: need---need%1:17:00:: of a new industrial plant---plant%1:06:01:: is a short period---period%1:28:00:: of pre employment---employment%1:04:02:: training---training%1:04:00:: for a large number---large_number%1:23:00:: of semi-skilled machine---machine%1:06:00:: operators---operator%1:18:00:: .
A few key skilled workers---skilled_worker%1:18:00:: experienced in the company---company%1:14:01:: 's type---type%1:09:00:: of work---work%1:04:00:: usually must be brought in with the plant---plant%1:06:01:: manager---manager%1:18:00:: , or hired away from a similar plant---plant%1:06:01:: elsewhere .
A prospective industry---industry%1:14:00:: also may be interested in the long-run advantages---advantage%1:07:00:: of training programs---training_program%1:09:00:: in the area---area%1:15:01:: to supply future skilled workers---skilled_worker%1:18:00:: and provide supplementary extension---extension%1:04:02:: courses---course%1:04:01:: for its employees---employee%1:18:00:: .
The existence---existence%1:26:00:: of a public school---public_school%1:14:00:: vocational training program---training_program%1:09:00:: in trade---trade%1:04:00:: and industry---industry%1:04:00:: provides a base---base%1:09:00:: from which such needs---need%1:17:00:: can be filled .
Additional courses---course%1:04:01:: can readily be added and special cooperative programs---program%1:09:00:: worked out with any new industry---industry%1:14:00:: if the basic facilities---facility%1:06:00:: , staff---staff%1:14:01:: and program---program%1:09:00:: are in being---being%1:26:00:: .
Thus , besides the training---training%1:04:00:: provided to youth---youth%1:14:00:: in school---school%1:14:00:: , the existence---existence%1:26:00:: of the school---school%1:14:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: can have supplementary benefits---benefit%1:07:00:: to industry---industry%1:14:00:: which make it an asset---asset%1:07:00:: to industrial development---development%1:04:01:: efforts---effort%1:04:00:: .
Few states---state%1:14:01:: make effective use---use%1:07:02:: of their existing vocational education---education%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: or funds---funds%1:21:00:: for the purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of attracting new industry---industry%1:14:00:: .
The opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: exists for states---state%1:14:01:: to reserve some of their vocational education---education%1:04:00:: funds---funds%1:21:00:: to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis---basis%1:24:00:: to subsidize any local preemployment training programs---preemployment_training_program%1:09:00:: that my be quickly set up in a community---community%1:14:00:: to aid a new industrial plant---plant%1:06:01:: .
The major weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: of vocational training programs---training_program%1:09:00:: in labor---labor%1:14:00:: surplus---surplus%1:07:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: is their focus---focus%1:09:00:: on serving solely local job---job%1:04:00:: demands---demand%1:09:00:: .
This weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: is not unique to labor---labor%1:14:00:: surplus---surplus%1:07:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: , for it is inherent in the system---system%1:14:00:: of local school---school%1:14:00:: districts---district%1:15:00:: in this country---country%1:14:00:: .
Planning---planning%1:04:00:: of vocational education---education%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: and courses---course%1:04:01:: is oriented to local employer---employer%1:18:00:: needs---need%1:26:00:: for trained workers---trained_worker%1:18:00:: .
All the manuals---manual%1:10:00:: for setting up vocational courses---course%1:04:01:: stress the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of first making a local survey---survey%1:10:00:: of skill---skill%1:09:01:: needs---need%1:26:00:: , of estimating the growth---growth%1:22:02:: of local jobs---job%1:04:00:: , and of consulting with local employers---employer%1:18:00:: on the types---type%1:09:00:: of courses---course%1:04:01:: and their content---content%1:10:00:: .
Furthermore , there is a cautious conservatism---conservatism%1:09:00:: on the part---part%1:09:02:: of those making local skill---skill%1:09:01:: surveys---survey%1:10:00:: .
Local jobs---job%1:04:00:: can be seen and counted , while opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: elsewhere are regarded as more hypothetical .
While the U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: Department of Labor---department_of_labor%1:14:00:: has a program---program%1:09:00:: of projecting industry---industry%1:04:00:: and occupational employment---employment%1:26:00:: trends---trend%1:15:02:: and publishing current outlook---outlook%1:09:00:: statements---statement%1:10:00:: , there is little tangible evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that these projections---projection%1:09:01:: have been used extensively in local curriculum---curriculum%1:10:00:: planning---planning%1:04:00:: .
The U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: Office of Education---group%1:03:00:: continues to stress local surveys---survey%1:04:02:: rather than national surveys---survey%1:10:00:: .
This procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: is extremely shortsighted in chronic labor---labor%1:14:00:: surplus---surplus%1:07:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: with a long history---history%1:10:00:: of declining employment---employment%1:04:00:: .
Elaborate studies---study%1:04:00:: have been made in labor---labor%1:14:00:: surplus---surplus%1:07:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: in order to identify sufficient numbers---number%1:07:00:: of local job---job%1:04:00:: vacancies---vacancy%1:26:00:: and future replacement---replacement%1:04:00:: needs---need%1:26:00:: for certain skills---skill%1:09:01:: to justify training programs---training_program%1:09:00:: for those skills---skill%1:09:01:: .
No effort is made in the same studies---study%1:04:00:: to present information---information%1:09:00:: on regional or national demand---demand%1:22:00:: trends---trend%1:15:02:: in these skills---skill%1:09:01:: or to consider whether regional or national demands---demand%1:22:00:: for other skills---skill%1:09:01:: might provide much better opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: for the youth---youth%1:14:00:: to be trained .
Moreover , the current information---information%1:09:00:: on what types---type%1:09:00:: of training---training%1:04:00:: are needed and possible is too limited and fragmentary .
There simply is not enough material---material%1:10:00:: available on the types---type%1:09:00:: of job---job%1:04:00:: skills---skill%1:09:01:: that are in demand and the types---type%1:09:00:: of training programs---training_program%1:09:00:: that are required or most suitable .
Much of the available information---information%1:09:00:: comes not from the Federal government---federal_government%1:14:00:: but from an exchange---exchange%1:04:03:: of experiences---experience%1:09:00:: among states---state%1:14:01:: .
State and local agencies---agency%1:14:00:: in the vocational education---education%1:04:00:: field---field%1:04:00:: must be encouraged to adopt a wider outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: on future job---job%1:04:00:: opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: .
There is a need---need%1:26:00:: for an expanded Federal effort---effort%1:04:00:: to provide research---research%1:04:00:: and information---information%1:09:00:: to help guide state education---education%1:04:00:: departments---department%1:14:00:: and local school boards---school_board%1:14:00:: in existing programs---program%1:09:00:: .
A related question---question%1:10:00:: is whether unemployed workers---worker%1:18:01:: can be motivated to take the training---training%1:04:00:: provided .
There is little evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that existing public or private training programs---training_program%1:09:00:: have any great difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: getting students---student%1:18:00:: to enroll in their programs---program%1:09:00:: , even though they must pay tuition---tuition%1:21:00:: , receive no subsistence---subsistence%1:21:00:: payments---payment%1:21:00:: , and are not guaranteed a job---job%1:04:00:: .
However , there always is some limit---limit%1:07:00:: to the numbers---number%1:07:00:: who will spend the time---time%1:28:05:: and effort---effort%1:04:01:: to acquire training---training%1:04:00:: .
Again , one major difficulty---difficulty%1:09:02:: is the local focus---focus%1:09:00:: .
A training program---training_program%1:09:00:: in a depressed area---area%1:15:01:: may have few enrollees---enrollee%1:18:00:: unless there is some apparent prospect---prospect%1:26:00:: for better employment---employment%1:04:00:: opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: afterwards , and the prospect---prospect%1:26:00:: may be poor if the training---training%1:04:00:: is aimed solely at jobs---job%1:04:00:: in the local community---community%1:14:00:: .
If there is adequate information---information%1:09:00:: on job---job%1:04:00:: opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: for skilled jobs---job%1:04:00:: elsewhere , many more workers---worker%1:18:00:: can be expected to respond .
Another problem---problem%1:26:00:: is who will pay for the training---training%1:04:00:: .
Local school---school%1:14:00:: districts---district%1:15:00:: are hard pressed financially and unenthusiastic about vocational training---training%1:04:00:: .
Programs---program%1:09:00:: usually are expanded only when outside funds---funds%1:21:00:: are available or local business leaders---business_leader%1:18:00:: demand---demand%1:10:00:: it .
Even industrial development---development%1:22:02:: leaders---leader%1:18:00:: find it hard to win local support---support%1:04:04:: for training---training%1:04:00:: unless a new industry---industry%1:14:00:: is in sight and requests---request%1:10:00:: it .
State governments---state_government%1:14:00:: have been taking the lead---lead%1:04:01:: in establishing area---area%1:15:01:: vocational schools---vocational_school%1:14:00:: , but their focus---focus%1:09:00:: is still on area---area%1:15:01:: job---job%1:04:00:: opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: .
Only the Federal government---federal_government%1:14:00:: is likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view---view%1:09:02:: and to pay for training---training%1:04:00:: to meet national skilled manpower---manpower%1:14:00:: needs .
If only state funds---funds%1:21:00:: were used to pay for the vocational education---education%1:04:00:: , it could be argued that the state---state%1:14:01:: should not have to bear the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of vocational training---training%1:04:00:: which would benefit employers---employer%1:18:00:: in other states---state%1:15:01:: .
However , if Federal funds---funds%1:21:00:: are used , it would be entirely appropriate to train workers---worker%1:18:01:: for jobs---job%1:04:00:: which could be obtained elsewhere as well as for jobs---job%1:04:00:: in the area---area%1:15:01:: of chronic unemployment---unemployment%1:26:00:: .
Such training---training%1:04:00:: would increase the tendency---tendency%1:09:00:: of workers---worker%1:18:01:: to leave the area---area%1:15:01:: and find jobs---job%1:04:00:: in other localities---locality%1:15:00:: .
A further possibility---possibility%1:09:01:: is suggested by the example---example%1:09:00:: of the G. I. bills---bill%1:10:04:: and also by some recent trends---trend%1:15:02:: in attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: toward improving college---college%1:14:00:: education---education%1:04:00:: : that is to provide financial assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: to individuals---individual%1:18:00:: for vocational training---training%1:04:00:: when local facilities---facility%1:06:00:: are inadequate .
This probably would require some support---support%1:04:04:: for subsistence---subsistence%1:21:00:: as well as for tuition---tuition%1:21:00:: , but the total---total%1:06:00:: would be no greater than for the proposals---proposal%1:10:00:: of unemployment compensation---unemployment_compensation%1:04:00:: or a Youth Conservation Corps---group%1:03:00:: .
A maximum---maximum%1:23:00:: of $ 600 per year per student---student%1:18:00:: would enable many to take training---training%1:04:00:: away from home---home%1:15:02:: .
A program---program%1:09:00:: of financial assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: would permit placing emphasis---emphasis%1:07:00:: on the national interest---interest%1:07:01:: in training highly skilled labor---labor%1:14:00:: .
Instead of being limited to the poor training---training%1:04:00:: facilities---facility%1:06:00:: in remote areas---area%1:15:01:: , the student---student%1:18:00:: would be able to move to large institutions---institution%1:14:00:: of concentrated specialized training---training%1:04:00:: .
Such specialized training---training%1:04:00:: institutions---institution%1:14:00:: could be located near the most rapidly growing industries---industry%1:14:00:: , where the equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: and job---job%1:04:00:: experience---experience%1:09:01:: exist and where the future employment---employment%1:04:00:: opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: are located .
This would heighten possibilities---possibility%1:26:00:: for part-time cooperative , on-the-job and extension---extension%1:04:02:: training---training%1:04:00:: .
Personal financial assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: would enable more emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: to be placed on the interests---interest%1:07:01:: of the individual---individual%1:18:00:: .
His aptitudes---aptitude%1:09:00:: and preferences---preference%1:12:00:: could be given more weight---weight%1:07:01:: in selecting the proper training---training%1:04:00:: .
Maude---person%1:03:00:: 's long nose---nose%1:08:00:: unexpectedly wrinkled up .
`` Happened to be in the hall---hall%1:06:03:: !
Oh , well , you can n't really blame Lolotte---person%1:03:00:: .
She lost her beau---beau%1:18:00:: to you '' .
But she was talking of Emile---person%1:03:00:: when she saw the black line---line%1:10:01:: of the open door---door%1:06:00:: ; Sarah---person%1:03:00:: remembered it clearly .
Maude---person%1:03:00:: went on .
Miss Celie---person%1:03:00:: 's taken to her bed---bed%1:06:00:: , with the door---door%1:06:00:: locked .
She opened it an inch---inch%1:23:00:: and poked out the keys---key%1:06:00:: for me to give you .
Here '' - She thrust a bundle---bundle%1:14:00:: of keys---key%1:06:00:: strung on a thick red cord---cord%1:06:00:: into Sarah---person%1:03:00:: 's hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
`` Not that there 's much use---use%1:07:00:: in locking up the smokehouse---smokehouse%1:06:00:: and the storehouse---storehouse%1:06:00:: now .
Drink your coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: '' -
Coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: .
Maude---person%1:03:00:: suddenly looked quite capable of pouring it down her throat---throat%1:08:00:: .
`` I do n't want it '' , Sarah---person%1:03:00:: said , firmly .
Maude---person%1:03:00:: swooped up the cup---cup%1:06:00:: and hiked up her top hoop---hoop%1:06:01:: as if about to take off with a racing---racing%1:04:00:: start---start%1:04:00:: .
At the door---door%1:06:01:: she turned back , her Roman nose---roman_nose%1:08:00:: looking very long now and satiric .
Ben---person%1:03:00:: and Lucien---person%1:03:00:: have gone after them .
It 's just like that book---book%1:10:00:: your Northern friend---friend%1:18:00:: wrote - except there are n't any ice floes---ice_floe%1:17:00:: to cross and no bloodhounds---bloodhound%1:05:00:: '' .
`` I do n't know Mrs. Stowe---person%1:03:00:: .
I told Ben---person%1:03:00:: so .
But of course the paterollers---patroller%1:18:00:: won n't be of any help---help%1:07:01:: , not with everything so upset and that Yankee cavalry---cavalry%1:14:01:: outfit---outfit%1:14:00:: they say is running around , God knows where '' .
She had swished away , she had been gone for a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: probably when Sarah---person%1:03:00:: suddenly realized that she ought to stop her , pour out the coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: , so no one would drink it .
But then the so-called coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: was bad enough at best , cold it was all but undrinkable - especially that cup---cup%1:23:01:: !
She was deeply , horribly sure that Lucien---person%1:03:00:: had filled it with opium---opium%1:06:00:: .
She had quarreled with Lucien---person%1:03:00:: , she had resisted his demands---demand%1:10:00:: for money---money%1:21:00:: - and if she died , by the provisions---provision%1:10:00:: of her marriage contract---marriage_contract%1:10:00:: , Lucien---person%1:03:00:: would inherit legally not only the immediate sum---sum%1:21:00:: of gold---gold%1:21:00:: under the floorboards---floorboard%1:06:00:: in the office---office%1:06:00:: , but later , when the war---war%1:04:00:: was over , her father---father%1:18:00:: 's entire estate---estate%1:21:02:: .
Now wait a minute---minute%1:28:00:: , she told herself , think about it ; Lucien---person%1:03:00:: is not the only person---person%1:03:00:: in this house---house%1:06:00:: who could have put opium---opium%1:06:00:: in that coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: .
She had lost a bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: of opium---opium%1:06:00:: - but that was on the trip---trip%1:04:00:: from New Orleans---new_orleans%1:15:00:: .
Or someone had taken it during her first day---day%1:28:01:: at Honotassa---location%1:03:00:: .
Yes , she had missed it after her talk---talk%1:10:00:: with Emile---person%1:03:00:: , after dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: , just before Emile---person%1:03:00:: was shot .
Rilly---person%1:03:00:: or Glendora---person%1:03:00:: had entered her room---room%1:06:00:: while she slept , bringing back her washed clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: .
So somebody else could have come in , too - then or later while she was out of the room---room%1:06:00:: .
It would have been easy to identify as opium---opium%1:06:00:: by its odor---odor%1:07:00:: .
It was not very reasonable to believe that Lucien---person%1:03:00:: had procured unprocurable opium---opium%1:06:00:: and come back to Honotassa---location%1:03:00:: with a formed plan---plan%1:09:00:: to murder her .
And he certainly could n't have guessed that she would resist his demand---demand%1:10:00:: for the gold---gold%1:21:00:: or that she was not the yielding - yes , and credible fool---fool%1:18:01:: he had every right---right%1:07:00:: to expect .
Do n't question , Rev---person%1:03:00:: had said , do n't invite danger---danger%1:26:00:: .
Her skin---skin%1:08:00:: crawled : Lolotte---person%1:03:00:: had told Maude---person%1:03:00:: that she was in the hall---hall%1:06:03:: and the door---door%1:06:00:: was open .
Sarah---person%1:03:00:: had begun to tell Lucien---person%1:03:00:: of Emile---person%1:03:00:: , she had begun to question and a little draft---draft%1:19:00:: had crept across the room---room%1:06:00:: from the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:00:: , open barely enough to show a rim---rim%1:25:00:: of blackness---blackness%1:26:00:: in the hall---hall%1:06:03:: .
So Lolotte---person%1:03:00:: - or anybody - could have listened , and that somebody could have already been supplied with the missing bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: of opium---opium%1:06:00:: .
The opium---opium%1:06:00:: had disappeared before Emile---person%1:03:00:: 's death---death%1:11:00:: and whoever shot him could not by any stretch---stretch%1:04:02:: of the imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: have foreseen Sarah---person%1:03:00:: 's own doubts---doubt%1:09:00:: and suspicions---suspicion%1:09:01:: - and questions---question%1:10:00:: .
She began to doubt whether there had been in fact a lethal dose---lethal_dose%1:06:00:: of opium---opium%1:06:00:: in the cup---cup%1:06:00:: .
So suppose somebody only wished to frighten her , so she would leave Honotassa---location%1:03:00:: !
That made a certain amount---amount%1:07:00:: of logic---logic%1:09:02:: .
Added to the argument---argument%1:10:02:: was the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that while she might have tasted the coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: if it had been still hot , she might even have drunk some of it , she would n't have taken enough to kill her , for she would have been warned by its taste---taste%1:09:02:: .
It was merely an attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to frighten her .
She would n't go back to New York---new_york%1:15:00:: as Maude suggested ; she would n't run like a scared cat .
She would n't go back to New York---new_york%1:15:01:: as Maude---person%1:03:00:: suggested ; she would n't run like a scared cat---cat%1:05:00:: .
She dressed and the accustomed routine---routine%1:04:00:: restored to her a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of normal everyday life---life%1:26:01:: .
But before she left her room---room%1:06:00:: she dug into her big moire---moire%1:06:00:: bag---bag%1:06:02:: , took out the envelope---envelope%1:06:01:: holding her marriage contract---marriage_contract%1:10:00:: and the wax---wax%1:27:00:: seal---seal%1:06:01:: had been broken .
So somebody else knew what would happen to her father---father%1:18:00:: 's money---money%1:21:02:: if she died .
Rev---person%1:03:00:: had known all along .
Rev---person%1:03:00:: did n't need to break the wax---wax%1:27:00:: seal---seal%1:06:01:: , read the contract---contract%1:10:00:: and find out .
He could conceivably have wished to make sure ; Rev---person%1:03:00:: loved Honotassa---location%1:03:00:: , it was like a part---part%1:17:00:: of his breath---breath%1:27:00:: and body---body%1:08:00:: ; Rev---person%1:03:00:: had stressed the need---need%1:26:00:: for money---money%1:21:00:: .
Rev---person%1:03:00:: would never have tried to give her poison---poison%1:27:00:: !
She thrust the envelope---envelope%1:06:01:: back in the bag---bag%1:06:02:: ; there was no point---point%1:10:01:: in locking it up in the armoire---armoire%1:06:00:: now , it was like locking the barn---barn%1:06:00:: after the horse---horse%1:05:00:: was stolen .
And in all likelihood , by now , there was more than one person---person%1:03:00:: in the house---house%1:06:00:: who knew the terms---term%1:10:02:: of her marriage contract---marriage_contract%1:10:00:: .
There was no point---point%1:10:01:: either in telling herself again what a fool---fool%1:18:01:: she 'd been .
She went downstairs and received another curious shock---shock%1:11:01:: , for when Glendora---person%1:03:00:: flapped into the dining room---dining_room%1:06:00:: in her homemade moccasins , Sarah---person%1:03:00:: asked her when she had brought coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: to her room---room%1:06:00:: and Glendora---person%1:03:00:: said she had n't .
`` Too much work---work%1:04:00:: this morning---morning%1:28:00:: , Miss Sarah---person%1:03:00:: - everybody gone like that '' -
Sarah---person%1:03:00:: swallowed past another kind---kind%1:09:00:: of constriction---constriction%1:25:00:: in her throat---throat%1:08:00:: .
`` Miss Maude---person%1:03:00:: .
She come to the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: and say she take it up to you '' .
Glendora---person%1:03:00:: put down a dish---dish%1:06:00:: of lukewarm rice---rice%1:13:00:: .
`` Not much breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: this morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
I do n't know what we 're going to do , Miss Sarah---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` We 've got to eat '' , Sarah---person%1:03:00:: said , curtly , because a chill---chill%1:12:02:: crawled over her again .
Maude---person%1:03:00:: ?
Glendora---person%1:03:00:: flapped away .
The rice---rice%1:13:00:: was n't dosed with opium---opium%1:06:00:: , indeed it had no taste---taste%1:09:02:: at all , not a grain---grain%1:17:00:: of salt---salt%1:13:00:: .
She ate what she could and went out along the covered passageway---passageway%1:06:00:: , with the rain---rain%1:27:00:: dripping from the vines---vine%1:20:00:: .
In the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: Glendora---person%1:03:00:: was despairingly picking chickens---chicken%1:13:00:: .
`` Get a basket---basket%1:06:00:: '' , Sarah---person%1:03:00:: told her .
`` We 'll go to the storehouse---storehouse%1:06:00:: '' .
Glendora---person%1:03:00:: dropped a chicken---chicken%1:13:00:: and a flurry---flurry%1:19:00:: of feathers---feather%1:05:00:: , and went with her through the drizzle---drizzle%1:19:00:: , to the storehouse---storehouse%1:06:00:: .
Sarah---person%1:03:00:: found the right key---key%1:06:00:: and unlocked the door---door%1:06:00:: .
It was a long , low room---room%1:06:00:: , like a root cellar---root_cellar%1:06:00:: , for it was banked up with soil---soil%1:27:01:: , and vines---vine%1:20:00:: had run rampant over that , too .
She doled out what Glendora---person%1:03:00:: vaguely guessed were the right amounts---amount%1:07:00:: of dried peas---pea%1:13:00:: , eggs---egg%1:13:00:: , cornmeal---cornmeal%1:13:00:: , a little---little%1:23:00:: salt---salt%1:13:00:: .
The shelves---shelf%1:06:00:: looked emptier than when Miss Celie---person%1:03:00:: had shown her the storeroom---storeroom%1:06:00:: , and since the men---man%1:18:00:: from the Commissary---commissary%1:06:00:: had called ; there were certainly now fewer mouths---mouth%1:18:00:: to feed but there was less to feed them with .
She took Glendora---person%1:03:00:: to the smokehouse---smokehouse%1:06:00:: , unlocked it and saw with satisfaction---satisfaction%1:12:00:: there was still a quantity---quantity%1:07:00:: of hams---ham%1:13:00:: and sides---side%1:13:00:: of bacon---bacon%1:13:00:: , hanging from the smoke---smoke%1:19:00:: stained rafters---rafter%1:06:00:: .
And the fields---field%1:15:00:: were green and growing .
`` Ca n't you possibly imagine what life---life%1:26:02:: is going to be like , here '' ?
Maude---person%1:03:00:: had said .
Maude---person%1:03:00:: .
She sent Glendora---person%1:03:00:: back to the house---house%1:06:00:: , her basket---basket%1:06:00:: and her apron---apron%1:06:00:: laden .
She stood for a moment---moment%1:28:00:: , rain---rain%1:27:00:: dripping from the trees---tree%1:20:00:: over her head---head%1:08:00:: , thinking of Maude---person%1:03:00:: .
Maude---person%1:03:00:: had the opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to take the bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: of opium---opium%1:06:00:: from Sarah---person%1:03:00:: 's room---room%1:06:00:: .
Maude---person%1:03:00:: had the cool ruthlessness---ruthlessness%1:07:00:: to do whatever she made up her mind to do .
She could n't see how her death---death%1:11:00:: could affect Maude---person%1:03:00:: .
She could n't see any reason---reason%1:16:00:: why Maude---person%1:03:00:: would attempt to frighten her .
Besides , there was something hysterical and silly , something almost childish about an attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to frighten her .
Maude---person%1:03:00:: was neither hysterical nor silly and Sarah---person%1:03:00:: rather doubted if she had ever been childish .
Yet Maude had suggested that Sarah return to New York---new_york%1:15:00:: .
Yet Maude---person%1:03:00:: had suggested that Sarah---person%1:03:00:: return to New York---new_york%1:15:01:: .
Maude---person%1:03:00:: could have shot Emile---person%1:03:00:: - if she 'd had a reason---reason%1:16:00:: to kill him .
There was no use---use%1:07:00:: in standing there in the drizzle---drizzle%1:19:00:: , trying to find a link---link%1:24:00:: between Emile---person%1:03:00:: 's murder---murder%1:04:00:: and opium---opium%1:06:00:: in a cup---cup%1:06:00:: of coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: .
She started back for the house , saw a light---light%1:15:00:: in the office , opened the door and surprised a domestic little scene which was far outside the dark realm of murder or attempted murder .
She started back for the house---house%1:06:00:: , saw a light---light%1:19:00:: in the office---office%1:06:00:: , opened the door---door%1:06:00:: and surprised a domestic little scene---scene%1:09:00:: which was far outside the dark realm---realm%1:26:01:: of murder---murder%1:04:00:: or attempted murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
Rev---person%1:03:00:: , George---person%1:03:00:: and Lolotte---person%1:03:00:: were mending shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: .
a lighted lamp---lamp%1:06:00:: stood on the table---table%1:06:01:: that dusky , drizzling day---day%1:28:01:: .
They were all three bent over a shabby riding boot---riding_boot%1:06:00:: ; George---person%1:03:00:: had a tack hammer---tack_hammer%1:06:00:: .
Lolotte---person%1:03:00:: held a patch---patch%1:06:00:: of leather---leather%1:27:00:: , Rev---person%1:03:00:: steadied something , a tiny brad---brad%1:06:00:: , waiting for George---person%1:03:00:: 's poised hammer---hammer%1:06:00:: .
George---person%1:03:00:: said , `` First thing---thing%1:04:00:: I do when I get to Vicksburg---location%1:03:00:: again , is get me a Yankee---yankee%1:18:02:: '' -
`` With boots---boot%1:06:00:: on '' , Lolotte---person%1:03:00:: laughed softly .
Rev---person%1:03:00:: looked up and saw her .
Lolotte---person%1:03:00:: looked up and stiffened .
George---person%1:03:00:: did n't look up at all .
There was no way---way%1:04:01:: to know , no way---way%1:04:01:: to guess whether any one of them was surprised at Sarah---person%1:03:00:: 's appearance---appearance%1:04:00:: , believing her to be drugged and senseless - and just possibly dead .
Rev---person%1:03:00:: said , `` Come in , Sarah---person%1:03:00:: .
Reckon you know the news---news%1:10:00:: '' .
And what news---news%1:10:00:: , Sarah---person%1:03:00:: thought as satirically as Maude---person%1:03:00:: might have said it .
Rev---person%1:03:00:: 's face---face%1:08:00:: was suddenly a little fixed and questioning .
He turned to George---person%1:03:00:: and Lolotte---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Take your cobbler---cobbler%1:18:00:: 's shop---shop%1:06:01:: somewhere else .
I want to talk to Sarah---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Everything in the office---office%1:06:00:: , the spreading circle---circle%1:25:00:: of lamplight---lamplight%1:19:00:: , the patch---patch%1:06:00:: of leather---leather%1:27:00:: in Lolotte---person%1:03:00:: 's hands---hand%1:08:00:: .
George---person%1:03:00:: poised with the tack hammer---tack_hammer%1:06:00:: , the homely , everyday atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: , all denied an attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: at murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
A rush---rush%1:11:00:: of panic---panic%1:12:00:: caught Sarah---person%1:03:00:: .
I mean I 've got to - to see to the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: .
Glendora---person%1:03:00:: '' -
Her words---words%1:10:03:: jumbled together and she all but ran from the office---office%1:06:00:: and from the question---question%1:10:00:: in Rev---person%1:03:00:: 's face---face%1:08:00:: .
she thought as warm , drizzling rain---rain%1:27:00:: touched her face---face%1:08:00:: .
She was no schoolgirl---schoolgirl%1:18:00:: , refusing to bear tales---tale%1:10:00:: .
As she reached the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:01:: the answer---answer%1:10:02:: presented itself ; if she told anyone of the opium---opium%1:06:00:: it must be Lucien---person%1:03:00:: , her husband---husband%1:18:00:: .
It might be , indeed it had already proved to be a marriage---marriage%1:14:00:: without love---love%1:12:00:: , but it was marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: .
So she could n't choose Rev---person%1:03:00:: as a confidant---confidant%1:18:00:: ; it must be Lucien---person%1:03:00:: .
Always provided that Lucien---person%1:03:00:: himself had not dosed her coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: with opium---opium%1:06:00:: , she thought , as coldly and sharply , again , as Maude---person%1:03:00:: might have said it .
She paused at the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:01:: , caught her breath , told herself firmly that the opium---opium%1:06:00:: was only an attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to frighten her and went into the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: , where Glendora---person%1:03:00:: was eyeing the chickens---chicken%1:13:00:: dismally and Maude---person%1:03:00:: was cleaning lamp chimneys---lamp_chimney%1:06:00:: .
Glendora---person%1:03:00:: gave a gulp---gulp%1:04:00:: .
`` Miss Sarah---person%1:03:00:: , I can n't cut up no chicken---chicken%1:13:00:: .
Miss Maude---person%1:03:00:: say she won n't '' .
Again the homely , everyday details---detail%1:09:00:: of daily living---living%1:09:00:: refuted a vicious attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to frighten her - or to murder her .
The homely everyday details---detail%1:09:00:: of living---living%1:09:00:: and domestic requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: also pressed upon her with their immediate urgency---urgency%1:07:00:: .
No matter what had happened or had n't happened , somebody had to see about dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: .
She eyed the chickens---chicken%1:13:00:: with , if she had known it , something of Glendora---person%1:03:00:: 's dismal look---look%1:07:01:: and thought with a certain fury---fury%1:12:00:: of the time---time%1:28:05:: she had spent on Latin verbs---verb%1:10:01:: .
Wage---wage%1:21:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: policies---policy%1:09:00:: of industry---industry%1:14:00:: are the result---result%1:19:00:: of a complex---complex%1:09:00:: of forces---force%1:07:01:: - no single explanation---explanation%1:09:00:: has been found which applies to all cases---case%1:11:00:: .
The purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of this paper---paper%1:10:01:: is to analyze one possible force---force%1:07:01:: which has not been treated in the literature---literature%1:10:01:: , but which we believe makes a significant contribution---contribution%1:04:02:: to explaining the wage---wage%1:21:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: of a few very important industries---industry%1:14:00:: .
While there may be several such industries---industry%1:14:00:: to which the model---model%1:09:00:: of this paper---paper%1:10:01:: is applicable , the authors---author%1:18:00:: make particular claim---claim%1:10:02:: of relevance---relevance%1:24:00:: to the explanation---explanation%1:09:00:: of the course---course%1:14:00:: of wages---wage%1:21:00:: and prices---price%1:07:00:: in the steel---steel%1:27:00:: industry---industry%1:14:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: since World War 2---world_war_ii%1:04:00:: , .
Indeed , the apparent stiffening---stiffening%1:04:00:: of the industry---industry%1:14:00:: 's attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: in the recent steel---steel%1:27:00:: strike---strike%1:04:00:: has a direct explanation---explanation%1:09:00:: in terms of the model---model%1:09:00:: here presented .
The model---model%1:09:00:: of this paper---paper%1:10:01:: considers an industry---industry%1:14:00:: which is not characterized by vigorous price competition---price_competition%1:24:00:: , but which is so basic that its wage---wage%1:21:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: policies---policy%1:09:00:: are held in check by continuous critical public scrutiny---scrutiny%1:04:00:: .
Where the industry---industry%1:14:00:: 's product---product%1:06:01:: price---price%1:07:00:: has been kept below the `` profit maximizing '' and `` entry---entry%1:04:01:: limiting '' prices---price%1:07:00:: due to fears---fear%1:12:01:: of public---public%1:14:00:: reaction---reaction%1:09:00:: , the profit---profit%1:21:00:: seeking producers---producer%1:18:01:: have an interest---interest%1:21:03:: in offering little real resistance---resistance%1:04:02:: to wage---wage%1:21:00:: demands---demand%1:10:00:: .
The contribution---contribution%1:04:02:: of this paper---paper%1:10:01:: is a demonstration---demonstration%1:04:00:: of this proposition---proposition%1:10:00:: , and an exploration---exploration%1:09:00:: of some of its implications---implication%1:09:01:: .
In order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force---force%1:07:01:: , which we may call the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of `` public limit---limit%1:07:00:: pricing---price%1:21:00:: '' on `` key '' wage---wage%1:21:00:: bargains---bargain%1:10:00:: , we deliberately simplify the model---model%1:09:00:: by abstracting from other forces---force%1:07:01:: , such as union---union%1:14:01:: power---power%1:07:00:: , which may be relevant in an actual situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
For expository purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: , this is best treated as a model---model%1:09:00:: which spells out the conditions---condition%1:26:00:: under which an important industry---industry%1:14:00:: affected with the public---public%1:14:00:: interest---interest%1:07:01:: would find it profitable to raise wages---wage%1:21:00:: even in the absence---absence%1:04:00:: of union---union%1:14:01:: pressures---pressure%1:07:00:: for higher wages---wage%1:21:00:: .
Part---part%1:24:00:: 1 , below describes this abstract model---model%1:09:00:: by spelling out its assumptions---assumption%1:09:00:: .
Part---part%1:24:00:: 2 , discusses the operation of the model---model%1:09:00:: and derives some significant conclusions---conclusion%1:09:00:: .
Part---part%1:24:00:: 3 , discusses the empirical relevance---relevance%1:24:00:: and policy---policy%1:09:00:: implications---implication%1:09:01:: of the conclusions---conclusion%1:09:00:: .
Part---part%1:24:00:: 4 , is a brief summary---summary%1:10:00:: .
The Mathematical Appendix---appendix%1:10:00:: presents the rigorous argument---argument%1:10:02:: , but is best read after Part---part%1:24:00:: 1 , in order that the assumptions---assumption%1:09:00:: underlying the equations---equation%1:10:00:: may be explicit .
The industry---industry%1:14:00:: with which this model---model%1:09:00:: is concerned is a basic industry---industry%1:14:00:: , producing a substantial share---share%1:21:00:: of gross national product---gross_national_product%1:21:00:: .
Price competition---price_competition%1:24:00:: is lacking .
For the purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: of setting the product---product%1:06:01:: price---price%1:07:00:: , the industry---industry%1:14:00:: behaves as a single entity---entity%1:03:00:: .
In wage---wage%1:21:00:: negotiations---negotiation%1:10:00:: , the industry---industry%1:14:00:: bargains as a unit---unit%1:09:00:: with a single union---union%1:14:01:: .
We are concerned with aggregate demand---demand%1:22:00:: for the industry---industry%1:14:00:: 's product---product%1:06:01:: .
The manner---manner%1:07:02:: in which this is shared among firms---firm%1:14:00:: is taken as given .
In any given time period---time_period%1:28:00:: , the aggregate demand---demand%1:22:00:: for the industry---industry%1:14:00:: 's product---product%1:06:01:: is determined by two things---thing%1:07:00:: : the price---price%1:07:00:: charged by the industry---industry%1:14:00:: , and the level---level%1:07:00:: of GNP---gnp%1:21:00:: .
For the purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: of this discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: , the problem---problem%1:26:00:: of relative prices---price%1:07:00:: is encompassed in these two variables---variable%1:09:00:: , since GNP---gnp%1:21:00:: includes other prices---price%1:07:00:: .
( We abstract here from technological progress---progress%1:04:01:: and assume that prices---price%1:07:00:: of all other products---product%1:06:01:: change proportionately . )
The form---form%1:09:00:: of the industry---industry%1:14:00:: demand---demand%1:22:00:: function---function%1:24:00:: is one which makes quantity---quantity%1:07:00:: demanded vary inversely with the product---product%1:06:01:: price---price%1:07:00:: , and vary directly with the level---level%1:07:00:: of GNP---gnp%1:21:00:: .
The industry---industry%1:14:00:: of this model---model%1:09:00:: is so important that its wage---wage%1:21:00:: and price---price%1:07:00:: policies---policy%1:09:00:: are affected with a public interest---interest%1:07:01:: .
Because of its importance---importance%1:07:00:: , and because the lack---lack%1:26:00:: of price competition---price_competition%1:24:00:: is well recognized , the industry---industry%1:14:00:: is under considerable public---public%1:14:00:: pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: not to raise its price---price%1:07:00:: any more than could be justified by cost---cost%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: .
The threat---threat%1:26:00:: of effective anti-trust action---action%1:04:01:: , provoked by `` gouging the public---public%1:14:00:: '' through price---price%1:07:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: not justified by cost---cost%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: , and fears---fear%1:12:01:: of endangering relations---relations%1:24:00:: with customers---customer%1:18:00:: , Congress---congress%1:14:01:: , the general public---public%1:14:00:: and the press , all operate to keep price---price%1:07:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: in some relation---relation%1:03:00:: to cost---cost%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: .
For the industry---industry%1:14:00:: of this model---model%1:09:00:: , the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of such public---public%1:14:00:: pressures---pressure%1:07:00:: in the past---past%1:28:00:: has been to hold the price---price%1:07:00:: well below the short-run profit---profit%1:21:00:: maximizing price---price%1:07:00:: ( given the wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: and the level---level%1:07:00:: of GNP---gnp%1:21:00:: ) , and even below the entry---entry%1:04:01:: limited price---price%1:07:00:: ( but not below average cost---average_cost%1:07:00:: ) .
For such an industry---industry%1:14:00:: , it is only `` safe '' to raise its price---price%1:07:00:: if such an increase---increase%1:23:00:: is manifestly `` justified '' by rising costs---cost%1:21:00:: ( due to rising wages---wage%1:21:00:: , etc . ) .
Thus , if public---public%1:14:00:: pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: sets the effective limit---limit%1:07:00:: to the price---price%1:07:00:: that the industry---industry%1:14:00:: may charge , this pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: is itself a function---function%1:24:00:: of the wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: .
In this model---model%1:09:00:: , we abstract from all non wage---wage%1:21:00:: sources---source%1:15:00:: of cost---cost%1:21:00:: changes---change%1:19:00:: , so that the `` public limit---limit%1:07:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: '' only rises as the wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: rises .
In such circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: , it may well be to the advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: of the industry---industry%1:14:00:: to allow an increase---increase%1:23:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: .
Since marginal costs---marginal_cost%1:07:00:: rise when the wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: rises , the profit maximizing price---price%1:07:00:: also rises when the public limit---limit%1:07:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: is elevated , and is likely to remain well above the latter .
The entry---entry%1:04:01:: limiting price---price%1:07:00:: will also be raised for potential domestic competition---competition%1:04:00:: , but unless general inflation---inflation%1:22:00:: permits profit margins---profit_margin%1:21:00:: to increase proportionately throughout the economy---economy%1:14:00:: , we might expect the public limit---limit%1:07:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: to approach the entry---entry%1:04:01:: limit---limit%1:07:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: .
The foreign entry---entry%1:04:01:: limit---limit%1:07:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: would be approached more rapidly , since domestic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rates---rate%1:21:00:: do not enter foreign costs---cost%1:21:00:: directly .
Where this approach---approach%1:04:02:: becomes critical , the industry---industry%1:14:00:: can be expected to put much emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: on this as evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: of its sincerity---sincerity%1:12:00:: in `` resisting '' the wage---wage%1:21:00:: pressures---pressure%1:07:00:: of a powerful union---union%1:14:01:: , requesting tariff---tariff%1:21:00:: relief---relief%1:04:02:: after it has `` reluctantly '' acceded to the union---union%1:14:01:: pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: .
Whether or not it is in the industry---industry%1:14:00:: 's interest---interest%1:07:01:: to allow the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: to rise obviously depends upon the extent---extent%1:26:00:: to which the public limit---limit%1:07:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: rises in response---response%1:19:00:: to a basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: , and the relation---relation%1:03:00:: of this response---response%1:19:00:: to the increase---increase%1:23:00:: in costs---cost%1:21:00:: accompanying the wage---wage%1:21:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: .
The extent---extent%1:26:00:: to which the public limit---limit%1:07:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: is raised by a given increase---increase%1:23:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: is itself a function---function%1:24:00:: of three things---thing%1:07:00:: : the passage---passage%1:04:04:: of time---time%1:28:05:: , the level---level%1:07:00:: of GNP---gnp%1:21:00:: , and the size---size%1:07:00:: of the wage---wage%1:21:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: .
We are abstracting from the fact---fact%1:09:01:: of strikes---strike%1:04:00:: here , but it should be obvious that the extent---extent%1:26:00:: to which the public limit---limit%1:07:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: is raised by a given increase---increase%1:23:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: is also a function---function%1:24:00:: of the show---show%1:10:03:: of resistance---resistance%1:04:02:: put up by the industry---industry%1:14:00:: .
The industry---industry%1:14:00:: may deliberately take a strike---strike%1:04:00:: , not to put pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: on the union---union%1:14:01:: , but in order to `` educate '' the government---government%1:14:00:: and the customers---customer%1:18:00:: of the industry---industry%1:14:00:: .
As a strike---strike%1:04:00:: continues , these parties---party%1:14:02:: increase their pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: on the industry---industry%1:14:00:: to reach an agreement---agreement%1:10:01:: .
They become increasingly willing to accept the price---price%1:07:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: that the industry---industry%1:14:00:: claims the wage---wage%1:21:00:: bargain---bargain%1:10:00:: would entail .
Public---public%1:14:00:: indignation---indignation%1:12:00:: and resistance---resistance%1:04:02:: to wage---wage%1:21:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: is obviously much less when the increases---increase%1:23:00:: are on the order---order%1:07:01:: of 3 % per annum than when the increases---increase%1:23:00:: are on the order---order%1:07:01:: of 3 % per month---month%1:28:00:: .
The simple passage---passage%1:04:04:: of an additional eleven months---month%1:28:00:: ' time---time%1:28:05:: makes the second 3 % boost---boost%1:07:00:: more acceptable .
Thus , the public limit---limit%1:07:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: is raised further by a given wage---wage%1:21:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: the longer it has been since the previous price---price%1:07:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: .
Notice , however , that the passage---passage%1:04:04:: of time---time%1:28:05:: does not permit the raising---raising%1:11:00:: of prices---price%1:07:00:: per se , without an accompanying wage---wage%1:21:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: .
Similarly , higher levels---level%1:07:00:: of GNP---gnp%1:21:00:: do not , in themselves , provide grounds---ground%1:16:00:: for raising prices---price%1:07:00:: , but they do relax some of the pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: on the industry---industry%1:14:00:: so that it can raise prices---price%1:07:00:: higher for a given wage---wage%1:21:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: .
This is not extended to anticipated levels---level%1:07:00:: of GNP---gnp%1:21:00:: , however - only the current level---level%1:07:00:: of GNP---gnp%1:21:00:: affects the public---public%1:14:00:: pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: against wage---wage%1:21:00:: price---price%1:07:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: .
Finally , since the public---public%1:14:00:: requires some restraint---restraint%1:07:00:: on the part---part%1:09:02:: of the companies---company%1:14:01:: , larger wage---wage%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: call for less than proportionately larger price---price%1:07:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: ( e. g. , if a wage---wage%1:21:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: of 5 % allows a price---price%1:07:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: of 7 % , a wage---wage%1:21:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: of 10 % allows a price---price%1:07:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: of something less than 14 % ) .
We assume that average total unit cost---unit_cost%1:21:00:: in the relevant region---region%1:15:00:: of operation---operation%1:26:00:: is constant with respect to quantity---quantity%1:07:00:: produced ( the average cost---average_cost%1:07:00:: curve---curve%1:10:00:: is horizontal , and therefore is identical with the marginal cost---marginal_cost%1:07:00:: curve---curve%1:10:00:: ) , and is the same for every firm---firm%1:14:00:: ( and therefore for the industry---industry%1:14:00:: ) .
The level---level%1:07:00:: of this average cost---average_cost%1:07:00:: is determined by factor---factor%1:09:00:: prices---price%1:07:00:: , technology---technology%1:04:00:: , and so forth .
As we have noted , however , we are abstracting from changes---change%1:24:00:: in all determinants---determinant%1:09:00:: of this level---level%1:07:00:: except for changes---change%1:24:00:: in the wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: .
The level---level%1:07:00:: of average cost---average_cost%1:07:00:: ( equal to marginal cost---marginal_cost%1:07:00:: ) is thus strictly a function---function%1:24:00:: of the wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: .
The single union---union%1:14:01:: which faces the industry---industry%1:14:00:: does not restrict its membership---membership%1:14:00:: , and there is an adequate supply---supply%1:23:00:: of labor---labor%1:14:00:: available to the firms---firm%1:14:00:: of the industry---industry%1:14:00:: at the going wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: .
The union---union%1:14:01:: does not regard unemployment---unemployment%1:26:00:: of its own members---member%1:18:00:: as a matter---matter%1:09:01:: of concern---concern%1:09:00:: when setting its own wage---wage%1:21:00:: policy---policy%1:09:00:: - its concern---concern%1:09:00:: with employment---employment%1:26:00:: makes itself felt in pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: upon the government---government%1:14:00:: to maintain full employment---employment%1:26:00:: .
The union---union%1:14:01:: vigorously demands wage---wage%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: from productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: , and wage---wage%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: to offset cost-of-living---cost_of_living%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: , but we abstract from these forces---force%1:07:01:: here .
For our present purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: we assume that the sole subject---subject%1:10:00:: of bargaining---bargaining%1:10:00:: is the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: ( not including productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: improvement---improvement%1:11:00:: factors---factor%1:11:00:: or cost-of-living---cost_of_living%1:21:00:: adjustments---adjustment%1:11:00:: ) , and it is this basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: which determines the level---level%1:07:00:: of costs---cost%1:21:00:: .
Productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: is something of an amorphous concept---concept%1:09:00:: and the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: in a given time period---time_period%1:28:00:: is not even well known to the industry---industry%1:14:00:: , much less to the union---union%1:14:01:: or to the public---public%1:14:00:: .
Disagreement---disagreement%1:26:00:: on the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: exacerbates the problem---problem%1:26:00:: of agreeing how an increase---increase%1:23:00:: in profit margins---profit_margin%1:21:00:: related to a productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: should be shared .
The existence---existence%1:26:00:: of conflict---conflict%1:04:00:: and of vigorous union---union%1:14:01:: demand---demand%1:10:00:: for an increase---increase%1:23:00:: in money---money%1:21:00:: wages---wage%1:21:00:: does not contradict the assumption---assumption%1:09:00:: that the union---union%1:14:01:: is willing to settle for cost-of-living---cost_of_living%1:21:00:: and productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: share---share%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: as distinct from a cost---cost%1:21:00:: raising increase---increase%1:23:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: .
We assume further that the union---union%1:14:01:: recognizes the possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: that price---price%1:07:00:: level---level%1:07:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: may offset wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: , and it does not entirely disregard the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of price---price%1:07:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: arising from its own wage---wage%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:23:00:: upon the `` real '' wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: .
For internal political reasons---reason%1:16:00:: , the union---union%1:14:01:: asks for ( and accepts ) increases---increase%1:23:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: , and would vigorously oppose a reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: in this rate---rate%1:21:00:: , but the adjustment---adjustment%1:11:00:: of the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: upwards is essentially up to the discretion---discretion%1:26:00:: of the companies---company%1:14:01:: of the industry---industry%1:14:00:: .
Changes---change%1:24:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: are cost---cost%1:21:00:: raising , and they constitute an argument---argument%1:10:02:: for raising prices---price%1:07:00:: .
However , it is not known to either the union---union%1:14:01:: or the public---public%1:14:00:: precisely how much of a cost---cost%1:21:00:: increase---increase%1:23:00:: is caused by a given change---change%1:24:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: , although the companies---company%1:14:01:: are presumed to have reliable estimates---estimate%1:09:00:: of this magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: .
In this model---model%1:09:00:: , then , the industry---industry%1:14:00:: is presumed to realize that they could successfully resist a change---change%1:04:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: , but since such a change---change%1:04:00:: is the only effective means---means%1:04:00:: to raising prices---price%1:07:00:: they may , in circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: to be spelled out in Part---part%1:24:00:: 2 , below , find it to their advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: to allow the wage---wage%1:21:00:: rise---rise%1:07:02:: .
Thus , for non negative changes---change%1:24:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: , the industry---industry%1:14:00:: becomes the active wage setter---wage_setter%1:26:00:: , since any increase---increase%1:23:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: can occur only by reason---reason%1:10:01:: of industry---industry%1:14:00:: acquiescence---acquiescence%1:26:00:: .
The presumption---presumption%1:09:00:: in the literature---literature%1:10:01:: would appear to be that the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: would be unchanged in this case---case%1:26:00:: , on the grounds---grounds%1:09:00:: that it is `` clearly '' not in the interest---interest%1:07:01:: of the industry---industry%1:14:00:: to raise wages---wage%1:21:00:: gratuitously .
From this presumption---presumption%1:09:00:: it is an easy step---step%1:04:02:: to the conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: that any observed increases---increase%1:23:00:: in the basic wage---wage%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: must be due to union---union%1:14:01:: behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: different and more aggressive than assumed in our model---model%1:09:00:: .
It is this conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: that we challenge ; we do so by disproving the presumption---presumption%1:09:00:: on which it is based .
It is convenient to assume that the union---union%1:14:01:: industry---industry%1:14:00:: contract---contract%1:10:00:: is of one year---year%1:28:01:: 's duration---duration%1:28:02:: .
Marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: in the new decade---decade%1:28:00:: will be no picnic---picnic%1:04:00:: - for the sixties---sixties%1:28:01:: will present possibly the most intense competitive activity---activity%1:04:00:: that you have experienced in the last 20 - 25 yr.---yr%1:28:00:: .
Companies---company%1:14:01:: of all types---type%1:09:00:: have made great advances---advance%1:11:00:: in production---production%1:04:00:: capabilities---capability%1:07:00:: and efficiencies---efficiency%1:09:00:: - in modern equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: and new processes---process%1:04:00:: , enlarged R + D facilities---facility%1:06:00:: , faster new product---product%1:06:01:: development---development%1:22:02:: .
Many companies---company%1:14:01:: have upgraded their sales---sale%1:04:02:: manpower---manpower%1:14:00:: and tested new selling---selling%1:04:00:: , distribution---distribution%1:04:01:: , and promotion---promotion%1:10:00:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: to gain a bigger competitive edge---edge%1:07:00:: .
Given this kind of business climate , what competitive marketing problems---problem%1:09:00:: will your company face in the next 10 yr. ?
Given this kind---kind%1:09:00:: of business---business%1:04:01:: climate---climate%1:26:01:: , what competitive marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: problems---problem%1:26:00:: will your company---company%1:14:01:: face in the next 10 yr.---yr%1:28:00:: ?
Based on our experience---experience%1:09:00:: with clients---client%1:18:01:: , we see 14 major problems---problem%1:26:00:: which fall into three broad groups---group%1:03:00:: - the market place---marketplace%1:04:00:: itself , marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: methods---method%1:09:00:: , and marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: management---management%1:04:00:: .
Based on our experience with clients , we see 14 major problems---problem%1:09:00:: which fall into three broad groups - the market place itself , marketing methods , and marketing management .
There has been an intensification---intensification%1:04:00:: of price---price%1:21:00:: consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: in recent years---year%1:28:01:: ; there is every indication---indication%1:10:00:: it will continue .
Frequently , wittingly or unwittingly , price---price%1:21:00:: consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: has been fostered by manufacturers---manufacturer%1:14:00:: , distributors---distributor%1:18:00:: , and dealers---dealer%1:18:02:: .
Despite generally good levels---level%1:07:00:: of income---income%1:21:00:: , we see greater price---price%1:21:00:: pressures---pressure%1:07:00:: than ever before - traveling back along the chain---chain%1:14:00:: from consumer---consumer%1:18:00:: to distributor---distributor%1:18:00:: to manufacturer---manufacturer%1:14:00:: .
Here are some key areas---area%1:09:00:: to examine to make sure your pricing---pricing%1:09:00:: strategy---strategy%1:09:00:: will be on target---target%1:09:00:: :
Has the probable price---price%1:21:00:: situation---situation%1:26:00:: in your field---field%1:04:00:: been forecast as a basis---basis%1:09:00:: for future---future%1:28:00:: planning---planning%1:04:02:: ?
Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things---thing%1:26:00:: get worse ?
Have cost---cost%1:21:00:: studies---study%1:04:00:: been made of every phase---phase%1:28:00:: of your operation---operation%1:04:06:: to determine what might be done if things---thing%1:11:00:: get worse ?
Have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem---problem%1:09:00:: ?
Have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling---selling%1:04:00:: approaches---approach%1:04:02:: designed to counter the price---price%1:21:00:: competition---competition%1:24:01:: problem---problem%1:26:00:: ?
Average consumer---consumer%1:18:00:: is becoming more sophisticated regarding product---product%1:06:01:: and advertising---advertising%1:10:00:: claims---claim%1:10:00:: , partly because of widespread criticism---criticism%1:10:00:: of such assertions---assertion%1:10:00:: .
This problem---problem%1:09:00:: can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses .
This problem---problem%1:26:00:: can force a change---change%1:11:00:: in marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: approach---approach%1:04:02:: in many kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of businesses---business%1:14:00:: .
Have you examined this problem---problem%1:09:00:: of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company ?
Have you examined this problem---problem%1:26:00:: of increasing consumer---consumer%1:18:00:: sophistication---sophistication%1:09:00:: from the standpoint---standpoint%1:09:00:: of your own company---company%1:14:01:: ?
Need for service is here to stay - and the problem---problem%1:09:00:: is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties .
Need---need%1:26:00:: for service---service%1:04:08:: is here to stay - and the problem---problem%1:26:00:: is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties---sixties%1:28:01:: .
There are two reasons---reason%1:16:00:: for this .
First , most products---product%1:06:01:: tend to become more complex .
First , most products---product%1:06:00:: tend to become more complex .
Second , in a competitive market---market%1:04:00:: , the customer---customer%1:18:00:: feels his weight---weight%1:07:01:: and throws it around .
Providing good customer---customer%1:18:00:: service---service%1:04:08:: requires as thorough a marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: and general management---management%1:04:00:: planning---planning%1:04:02:: job---job%1:04:01:: as the original selling---selling%1:04:00:: of the product---product%1:06:01:: .
Too often it is thought of at the last moment---moment%1:28:00:: of new product---product%1:06:01:: introduction---introduction%1:04:01:: .
Good service---service%1:04:08:: starts with product---product%1:06:01:: design---design%1:04:00:: and planning---planning%1:04:02:: :
Many products---product%1:06:01:: seem to be designed for a production---production%1:04:00:: economy---economy%1:14:00:: , not for a service---service%1:04:08:: one .
Proper follow-through---follow-through%1:04:00:: requires training your own sales---sale%1:04:02:: organization---organization%1:09:00:: , and your distributor---distributor%1:18:00:: organizations---organization%1:09:00:: , not only in the techniques---technique%1:09:00:: but also in good customer---customer%1:18:00:: relations---relations%1:24:00:: .
Have you assessed the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of service---service%1:04:08:: and given it proper attention---attention%1:09:00:: ?
In spending his money---money%1:21:02:: today , the consumer is pulled in many directions .
In spending his money---money%1:21:00:: today , the consumer---consumer%1:18:00:: is pulled in many directions---direction%1:09:00:: .
To the manufacturer---manufacturer%1:14:00:: of the more convenient type---type%1:09:00:: product---product%1:06:01:: - the purchase---purchase%1:04:00:: of which can be switched , delayed , or put off entirely - the implications---implication%1:09:01:: are important .
Your competition---competition%1:24:01:: is now proportionately greater - you are competing not only against manufacturers---manufacturer%1:14:00:: in the same field---field%1:04:00:: but also against a vast array---array%1:14:00:: of manufacturers---manufacturer%1:14:00:: of other appealing consumer---consumer%1:18:00:: products---product%1:06:01:: .
Many industry---industry%1:04:00:: trade---trade%1:04:05:: associations---association%1:14:00:: are developing campaigns---campaign%1:04:02:: to protect or enhance the share---share%1:21:00:: of the consumer---consumer%1:18:00:: 's dollar---dollar%1:21:00:: being spent on their particular products---product%1:06:01:: .
Has your company---company%1:14:01:: thought through its strategy---strategy%1:09:00:: in this whole `` discretionary buying---buying%1:04:00:: '' area---area%1:09:00:: ?
The trends---trend%1:15:02:: have been in evidence for many years---year%1:28:01:: - population shifts---population_shift%1:11:00:: to the Southwest---location%1:03:00:: and Far West---location%1:03:00:: , and from city---city%1:15:00:: to suburbs---suburb%1:15:00:: .
These shifts---population_shift%1:11:00:: will continue in the next 10 yr.---yr%1:28:00:: .
Have you considered the implications---implication%1:09:01:: of continuing geographic shifts---population_shift%1:11:00:: in terms of sales force---sales_force%1:14:00:: allocation---allocation%1:04:00:: , strength---strength%1:07:09:: of distributor---distributor%1:18:00:: organizations---organization%1:14:00:: , and even plant---plant%1:06:01:: location---location%1:03:00:: ?
We have already witnessed great changes---change%1:19:00:: through mergers---merger%1:04:00:: and acquisitions---acquisition%1:04:00:: in the food---food%1:03:00:: industry---industry%1:04:00:: - at both the manufacturing---manufacturing%1:04:00:: and retail---retail%1:04:00:: ends---end%1:15:01:: .
Instead of relatively small sales---sale%1:04:00:: to many accounts---account%1:26:00:: , there are now larger sales---sale%1:04:00:: to or through fewer accounts---account%1:26:00:: .
The change---change%1:24:00:: may require different products---product%1:06:01:: , pricing---pricing%1:09:00:: , packaging---packaging%1:04:00:: , warehousing---warehousing%1:04:00:: , salesmanship---salesmanship%1:09:00:: , advertising---advertising%1:04:00:: and executive attention---attention%1:09:00:: - practically every link---link%1:06:00:: in the marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: network---network%1:14:00:: may have to be adjusted .
Have you examined these trends---trend%1:15:02:: , forecast the effects---effect%1:19:00:: , and planned your marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: strategy---strategy%1:09:00:: to compete effectively under changing circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: ?
In the area---area%1:09:00:: of private label---label%1:10:02:: competition---competition%1:24:01:: , it is logical to expect a continuation---continuation%1:04:00:: of trends---trend%1:15:02:: which have been under way during the first decade---decade%1:28:00:: .
As mass dealer---dealer%1:14:00:: and distributor---distributor%1:18:00:: organizations---organization%1:14:00:: grow in size---size%1:07:00:: , there is every reason---reason%1:16:00:: to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer---manufacturer%1:14:00:: 's as well as the distributor---distributor%1:18:00:: 's profits---profits%1:21:01:: - which is , in effect , what the sale---sale%1:04:02:: of private brands---brand%1:10:00:: tends to do .
Average manufacturer---manufacturer%1:14:00:: frequently has helped build private brand---brand%1:10:00:: business---business%1:04:01:: , delivering largely the same qualities---quality%1:07:00:: and styles---style%1:09:01:: in private brand---brand%1:10:00:: merchandise---merchandise%1:06:00:: as in branded .
Moreover , the larger and more aggressive mass distribution---distribution%1:04:01:: outlets---outlet%1:06:01:: and chain stores---chain_store%1:06:00:: have insisted on high quality---high_quality%1:07:00:: - and the customer---customer%1:18:00:: seems to have caught on .
If you are up against private brand---brand%1:10:00:: competition---competition%1:24:01:: , have you formulated a long-term program---program%1:09:00:: for researching and strengthening your market---market%1:04:00:: position---position%1:26:00:: ?
If private brand---brand%1:10:00:: competition---competition%1:24:01:: has n't been felt in your product---product%1:06:01:: field---field%1:04:00:: as yet , have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear ?
Display---display%1:04:00:: merchandising---merchandising%1:04:00:: , backed by pre selling---selling%1:04:00:: through advertising---advertising%1:04:00:: and promotion---promotion%1:10:00:: , will continue to make strides---stride%1:04:01:: in the sixties---sixties%1:28:01:: .
It has multiple implications---implication%1:09:01:: and possible headaches---headache%1:09:00:: for your marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: .
How can you cash in on this fast-growing type---type%1:09:00:: of outlet---outlet%1:06:01:: and still maintain relationships---relationship%1:26:01:: with older existing outlets---outlet%1:06:01:: which are still important ?
If you have a higher quality---quality%1:07:02:: product---product%1:06:01:: , how can you make it stand out - justify its premium price---price%1:07:00:: - without the spoken word---word%1:10:03:: ?
Salesmanship---salesmanship%1:09:00:: is still necessary , but it 's a different brand---brand%1:09:00:: of salesmanship---salesmanship%1:09:00:: .
Have you carefully examined the selling---selling%1:04:00:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: which best suit your products---product%1:06:01:: ?
Have you studied the caliber---caliber%1:07:00:: and sales---sale%1:04:02:: approaches---approach%1:04:02:: of your sales force---sales_force%1:14:00:: in relation to requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: for effective marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: ?
Are you experimenting with different selling---selling%1:04:00:: slants---slant%1:09:00:: in developing new customers---customer%1:18:00:: ?
Some distribution---distribution%1:04:01:: costs---cost%1:21:00:: are kept up by competitive pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: , some by the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that the customers---customer%1:18:00:: have come to expect certain niceties---nicety%1:07:00:: and flourishes---flourish%1:10:02:: .
No manufacturer---manufacturer%1:14:00:: has taken the initiative---initiative%1:04:00:: in pointing out the costs---cost%1:21:00:: involved .
The use---use%1:04:00:: of bulk handling---handling%1:04:00:: is continuously growing .
Computers---computer%1:06:00:: are being used to keep branch---branch%1:14:00:: inventories---inventory%1:21:00:: at more workable levels---level%1:07:00:: .
`` Selective selling---selling%1:04:00:: '' - concentrating sales---sale%1:04:02:: on the larger accounts---account%1:26:00:: - has been used effectively by some manufacturers---manufacturer%1:14:00:: .
There may be possible economies---economy%1:04:00:: at any one of a number---number%1:07:00:: of links---link%1:06:00:: in your marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: and distribution---distribution%1:04:01:: chain---chain%1:14:00:: .
Do you have a program---program%1:09:00:: for scrutinizing all these links---link%1:06:00:: regularly and carefully - and with some imagination---imagination%1:09:03:: ?
In your sales force---sales_force%1:14:00:: , will a smaller number---number%1:07:00:: of higher-priced , high quality---quality%1:07:02:: salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: serve you best , or can you make out better with a larger number---number%1:07:00:: of lower paid salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: ?
Will your trade---trade%1:04:01:: customers---customer%1:18:00:: settle for less attention---attention%1:04:01:: and fewer frills in return for some benefit---benefit%1:07:00:: they can share ?
In one company---company%1:14:01:: covering the country---country%1:15:00:: with a high quality---quality%1:07:02:: sales force---sales_force%1:14:00:: of 10 men---men%1:14:00:: , the president---president%1:18:01:: personally phones each major account---account%1:26:00:: every 6 mos.---month%1:28:01:: .
As a result---result%1:19:00:: , distribution costs---distribution_cost%1:21:00:: were cut , customer---customer%1:18:00:: relations---relations%1:24:00:: improved .
Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job---job%1:04:01:: .
Distribution costs---distribution_cost%1:21:00:: are almost bound to increase in the sixties---sixties%1:28:01:: - and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element---element%1:09:00:: and experiment with alternative ways---way%1:07:01:: of doing the job---job%1:04:04:: .
From the manufacturer---manufacturer%1:14:00:: 's point of view---point_of_view%1:09:00:: , the increasing cost---cost%1:21:00:: of advertising---advertising%1:04:00:: and promotion---promotion%1:10:00:: is a very real problem---problem%1:26:00:: to be faced in the sixties---sixties%1:28:01:: .
It is accentuated by the need---need%1:26:00:: for pre selling---selling%1:04:00:: goods , and private label---label%1:10:02:: competition---competition%1:24:01:: .
How much fundamental thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: and research---research%1:04:00:: has your company---company%1:14:01:: done on its advertising---advertising%1:04:00:: program---program%1:09:01:: ?
Are you following competition---competition%1:24:01:: willy-nilly - trying to match dollar---dollar%1:23:00:: for dollar---dollar%1:23:00:: - or are you experimenting with new means---means%1:04:00:: for reaching and influencing consumers---consumer%1:18:00:: ?
Have you evaluated the proper place---place%1:09:00:: of advertising---advertising%1:04:00:: and all phases---phase%1:28:00:: of promotion---promotion%1:10:00:: in your total marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: - from the standpoint---standpoint%1:09:00:: of effort---effort%1:04:01:: , money---money%1:21:00:: , and effectiveness---effectiveness%1:07:00:: ?
Practically all forecasts---forecast%1:10:00:: mention new and exciting products---product%1:06:01:: on the horizon---horizon%1:07:00:: .
Will you be out in the market place---marketplace%1:04:00:: with some of these sales---sale%1:04:02:: building new products---product%1:06:01:: ?
If competition---competition%1:24:01:: beats you to it , this exciting new product---product%1:06:01:: era---era%1:28:00:: can have real headaches---headache%1:09:00:: in store .
On the other hand , the process---process%1:04:00:: of obsoleting an old product---product%1:06:01:: and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive .
As markets---market%1:04:00:: become larger and marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: more complex , the costs---cost%1:21:00:: of an error---error%1:04:02:: become progressively larger .
Is your R + D or product development---development%1:04:01:: program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market ?
Is your R + D or product---product%1:06:01:: development---development%1:22:02:: program---program%1:09:01:: tuned in to the commercial realities---reality%1:26:02:: of the market---market%1:04:00:: ?
Are there regular communications---communication%1:10:01:: from the field---field%1:04:00:: , or meetings---meeting%1:14:00:: of sales---sale%1:04:02:: and marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: with R + D people---people%1:14:00:: ?
Technical knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: is a wonderful thing---thing%1:09:00:: , but it 's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register---cash_register%1:06:00:: .
Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; who can develop reliable estimates---estimate%1:10:00:: of sales volume , production , and distribution costs ; and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance ?
Are there individuals---individual%1:03:00:: in your organization---organization%1:14:00:: who can shepherd a new product---product%1:06:01:: through to commercialization---commercialization%1:04:00:: ; who can develop reliable estimates---estimate%1:09:00:: of sales---sale%1:04:02:: volume---volume%1:07:03:: , production---production%1:04:00:: , and distribution costs---distribution_cost%1:21:00:: ; and translate the whole---whole%1:09:00:: into profit and loss---profit_and_loss%1:21:00:: and balance sheet---balance_sheet%1:21:00:: figures---figure%1:21:00:: which management---management%1:14:00:: can act on with some assurance---assurance%1:09:00:: ?
We have seen good new products---product%1:06:01:: shelved because no one had the assignment---assignment%1:04:00:: to develop such facts---fact%1:10:01:: and plans---plan%1:09:00:: - and management---management%1:14:00:: could n't make up its mind .
There is a shortage---shortage%1:07:00:: of salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: today .
In the future---future%1:28:00:: , quantitative demand---demand%1:22:00:: will be greater because of the expansion---expansion%1:04:00:: of the economy---economy%1:14:00:: , and the qualitative need---need%1:26:00:: will be greater still .
While many companies---company%1:14:01:: have done fine work---work%1:04:00:: in developing sales---sale%1:04:02:: personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: , much---much%1:23:00:: of it has been product---product%1:06:01:: rather than sales---sale%1:04:02:: training---training%1:04:00:: .
Nor has the training---training%1:04:00:: been enough in relation to the need---need%1:26:00:: .

The key---key%1:09:00:: to effective marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: is wrapped up in defining your company---company%1:14:01:: 's marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: problems---problem%1:09:00:: realistically .
Solutions---solution%1:09:00:: frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems---problem%1:09:00:: , whether they be in the market---market%1:04:00:: , in marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: methods---method%1:09:00:: or in marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: management---management%1:04:00:: .
If companies---company%1:14:01:: will take the time---time%1:28:05:: to give objective consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: to their major problems---problem%1:09:00:: and to the questions---question%1:10:00:: they provoke , then a long constructive step---step%1:04:02:: will have been taken toward more effective marketing---marketing%1:04:00:: in next decade---decade%1:28:00:: .
Today the private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: will also investigate insurance claims---insurance_claim%1:04:00:: or handle divorce---divorce%1:04:00:: cases---case%1:04:00:: , but his primary function---function%1:04:00:: remains what it has always been , to assist those who have money---money%1:21:02:: in their unending struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: with those who have not .
It is from this unpromising background---background%1:07:00:: that the fictional private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: was recruited .
The mythological private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: differs from his counterpart---counterpart%1:09:00:: in real life---life%1:26:01:: in two essential ways---way%1:07:01:: .
On the one hand , he does not work for a large agency---agency%1:14:01:: , but is almost always self-employed .
As a free-lance investigator---investigator%1:18:02:: , the fictional detective---detective%1:18:00:: is responsible to no one---person%1:03:00:: but himself and his client---client%1:18:00:: .
For this reason---reason%1:10:01:: , he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure---figure%1:07:00:: , whose rugged individualism---individualism%1:07:00:: need not be pressed into the mold---mold%1:25:00:: of a 9 to 5 routine---routine%1:04:00:: .
On the other hand , the fictional detective---detective%1:18:00:: does not break strikes---strike%1:04:00:: or handle divorce---divorce%1:04:00:: cases---case%1:04:00:: ; no client---client%1:18:00:: would ever think of asking him to do such things---thing%1:04:00:: .
Whatever his original assignment---assignment%1:04:00:: , the fictional private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: ends up by investigating and solving a crime---crime%1:04:00:: , usually a murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
Operating as a one man police force---police_force%1:14:00:: in fact---fact%1:26:01:: if not in name , he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police---police%1:14:00:: themselves .
He catches criminals---criminal%1:18:00:: not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee---fee%1:21:00:: at all ) , but because he enjoys his work---work%1:04:01:: , because he firmly believes that murder---murder%1:04:00:: must be punished .
Thus the fictional detective---detective%1:18:00:: is much more than a simple businessman---businessman%1:18:00:: .
He is , first and foremost , a defender---defender%1:18:00:: of public morals---morals%1:16:00:: , a servant---servant%1:18:00:: of society---society%1:14:00:: .
It is this curious blend---blend%1:11:00:: of rugged individualism---individualism%1:07:00:: and public service---service%1:04:00:: which accounts for the great appeal---appeal%1:07:00:: of the mythological detective---detective%1:18:00:: .
By virtue of his self-reliance---self-reliance%1:26:00:: , his individualism---individualism%1:07:00:: and his freedom---freedom%1:26:01:: from external restraint---restraint%1:04:00:: , the private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: is a perfect embodiment---embodiment%1:18:00:: of the middle class---middle_class%1:14:00:: conception---conception%1:09:00:: of liberty---liberty%1:26:03:: , which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost .
At the same time , because the personal code---code%1:10:01:: of the detective---detective%1:18:00:: coincides with the legal dictates---dictate%1:10:00:: of his society---society%1:14:00:: , because he likes to catch criminals---criminal%1:18:00:: , he is in middle class---middle_class%1:14:00:: eyes---eyes%1:09:00:: a virtuous man---man%1:18:00:: .
In this way---way%1:07:01:: , the private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: gets the best of two possible worlds---world%1:09:00:: .
He is an individualist---individualist%1:18:00:: but not an anarchist---anarchist%1:18:00:: ; he is a public servant---servant%1:18:00:: but not a cop---cop%1:18:00:: .
In short , the fictional private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: is a specialized version---version%1:09:01:: of Adam Smith---person%1:03:00:: 's ideal entrepreneur---entrepreneur%1:18:00:: , the man---man%1:18:00:: whose private ambitions---ambition%1:12:00:: must always and everywhere promote the public welfare---welfare%1:07:00:: .
In the mystery story---mystery_story%1:10:00:: , as in The Wealth of Nations , individualism---individualism%1:07:00:: and the social good---good%1:07:00:: are two sides---side%1:15:00:: of the same benevolent coin---coin%1:21:02:: .
There is only one catch---catch%1:07:00:: to this idyllic arrangement---arrangement%1:09:00:: :
Adam Smith---person%1:03:00:: was wrong .
Not only did the ideal entrepreneur---entrepreneur%1:18:00:: not produce the greatest good---good%1:07:00:: for the greatest number---number%1:07:00:: , he ended by destroying himself , by giving birth---birth%1:28:00:: to monopoly---monopoly%1:26:01:: capitalism---capitalism%1:14:00:: .
The rise---rise%1:11:00:: of the giant corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: in Western Europe---europe%1:17:00:: and the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: dates from the period---period%1:28:00:: 1880 - 1900 .
Now , although the roots---root%1:15:00:: of the mystery story---mystery_story%1:10:00:: in serious literature---literature%1:10:00:: go back as far as Balzac---balzac%1:18:00:: , Dickens---person%1:03:00:: , and Poe---person%1:03:00:: , it was not until the closing decades---decade%1:28:00:: of the 19 th century---century%1:28:00:: that the private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: became an established figure---figure%1:18:00:: in popular fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: .
Sherlock Holmes---sherlock_holmes%1:18:00:: , the ancestor---ancestor%1:18:00:: of all private eyes---private_eye%1:18:00:: , was born during the 1890 s .
Thus the transformation---transformation%1:11:00:: of Adam Smith---person%1:03:00:: 's ideal entrepreneur---entrepreneur%1:18:00:: into a mythological detective---detective%1:18:00:: coincides closely with the decline---decline%1:22:02:: of the real entrepreneur---entrepreneur%1:18:00:: in economic life---life%1:26:01:: .
Driven from the marketplace---marketplace%1:04:00:: by the course---course%1:14:00:: of history---history%1:28:00:: , our hero---hero%1:09:00:: disguises himself as a private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: .
The birth---birth%1:28:00:: of the myth---myth%1:10:00:: compensates for the death---death%1:28:00:: of the ideal---ideal%1:09:00:: .
Even on the fictional level---level%1:26:00:: , however , the contradictions---contradiction%1:24:00:: which give rise to the mystery story---mystery_story%1:10:00:: are not fully resolved .
The individualism---individualism%1:07:00:: and public service---service%1:04:00:: of the private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: both stem from his dedication---dedication%1:07:00:: to a personal code of conduct---code_of_conduct%1:09:00:: : he enforces the law---law%1:14:00:: without being told to do so .
The private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: is therefore a moral man---man%1:18:00:: ; but his morality---morality%1:16:00:: rests upon that of his society---society%1:14:00:: .
The basic premise---premise%1:10:00:: of all mystery stories---mystery_story%1:10:00:: is that the distinction---distinction%1:09:00:: between good---good%1:07:01:: and bad---bad%1:07:00:: coincides with the distinction---distinction%1:09:00:: between legal and illegal .
Unfortunately , this assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: does not always hold good .
As capitalism---capitalism%1:14:00:: in the 20 th century---century%1:28:00:: has become increasingly dependent upon force---force%1:04:01:: and violence---violence%1:04:01:: for its survival---survival%1:26:00:: , the private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: is placed in a serious dilemma---dilemma%1:09:00:: .
It is the gradual unfolding---unfolding%1:22:00:: and deepening---deepening%1:22:00:: of this contradiction---contradiction%1:24:00:: which creates the inner dialectic---dialectic%1:24:00:: of the evolution---evolution%1:22:01:: of the mystery story---mystery_story%1:10:00:: .
With the advent---advent%1:04:00:: of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle---person%1:03:00:: 's Sherlock Holmes---sherlock_holmes%1:18:00:: , the development---development%1:22:02:: of the modern private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: begins .
Sherlock Holmes---sherlock_holmes%1:18:00:: is not merely an individualist---individualist%1:18:00:: ; he is very close to being a mental case---mental_case%1:18:00:: .
A brief list---list%1:10:00:: of the great detective---detective%1:18:00:: 's little idiosyncrasies---idiosyncrasy%1:07:00:: would provide Dr. Freud---person%1:03:00:: with ample food for thought---food_for_thought%1:09:00:: .
Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: is addicted to the use---use%1:04:00:: of cocaine---cocaine%1:06:00:: and other refreshing stimulants---stimulant%1:06:00:: ; he is prone to semi catatonic trances---trance%1:26:00:: induced by the playing---playing%1:04:01:: of the vioiln---violin%1:06:00:: ; he is a recluse---recluse%1:18:00:: , an incredible egotist---egotist%1:18:00:: , a confirmed misogynist---misogynist%1:18:00:: .
Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: rebels against the social conventions---convention%1:09:00:: of his day---day%1:28:05:: not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds---grounds%1:10:00:: .
His eccentricity---eccentricity%1:07:00:: begins as a defense---defense%1:04:03:: against boredom---boredom%1:12:00:: .
It was in order to avoid the stuffy routine---routine%1:04:00:: of middle class---middle_class%1:14:00:: life---life%1:26:01:: that Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: became a detective---detective%1:18:00:: in the first place .
As he informs Watson---person%1:03:00:: , `` My life---life%1:26:02:: is spent in one long effort---effort%1:04:00:: to escape from the commonplaces---commonplace%1:10:00:: of existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
These little problems---problem%1:10:00:: help me to do so '' .
Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: is a public servant---servant%1:18:00:: , to be sure ; but the society---society%1:14:00:: which he serves bores him to tears---tears%1:04:00:: .
The curious relationship---relationship%1:26:01:: between Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: and Scotland Yard---scotland_yard%1:14:00:: provides an important clue---clue%1:10:01:: to the deeper significance---significance%1:09:01:: of his eccentric behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: .
Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland Yard---scotland_yard%1:14:00:: , Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: has nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but contempt---contempt%1:12:00:: for the intelligence---intelligence%1:09:00:: and mentality---mentality%1:09:00:: of the police---police%1:14:00:: .
They for their part---part%1:09:02:: are convinced that Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: is too `` unorthodox '' and `` theoretical '' to make a good detective---detective%1:18:00:: .
Why do the police---police%1:14:00:: find Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: `` unorthodox '' ?
On the face of it , it is because he employs deductive techniques---technique%1:09:00:: alien to official police---police%1:14:00:: routine---routine%1:04:00:: .
Another , more interesting explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: , is hinted at by Watson---person%1:03:00:: when he observes on several occasions---occasion%1:11:00:: that Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: would have made a magnificent criminal---criminal%1:18:00:: .
The great detective---detective%1:18:00:: modestly agrees .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: 's insight---insight%1:09:02:: is verified by the mysterious link---link%1:24:00:: between Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: and his arch opponent , Dr. Moriarty---person%1:03:00:: .
The two men---man%1:18:00:: resemble each other closely in their cunning , their egotism---egotism%1:07:00:: , their relentlessness---relentlessness%1:07:00:: .
The first series---series%1:10:00:: of Sherlock Holmes---sherlock_holmes%1:18:00:: adventures---adventure%1:04:00:: ends with Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: and Moriarty---person%1:03:00:: grappling together on the edge---edge%1:15:00:: of a cliff---cliff%1:17:00:: .
They are presumed to have plunged to a common grave---grave%1:28:00:: in this fatal embrace---embrace%1:04:00:: .
Linked to Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: even in death---death%1:11:00:: , Moriarty---person%1:03:00:: represents the alter-ego---alter_ego%1:18:00:: of the great detective---detective%1:18:00:: , the image---image%1:09:02:: of what our hero---hero%1:09:00:: might have become were he not a public servant---servant%1:18:00:: .
Just as Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: the eccentric---eccentric%1:18:00:: stands behind Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: the detective---detective%1:18:00:: , so Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: the potential criminal---criminal%1:18:00:: lurks behind both .
In the modern English `` whodunnit---whodunit%1:10:00:: '' , this insinuation---insinuation%1:10:00:: of latent criminality---criminality%1:26:00:: in the detective---detective%1:18:00:: himself has almost entirely disappeared .
Hercule Poirot---person%1:03:00:: and Lord Peter Whimsey---person%1:03:00:: ( the respective creations---creation%1:06:00:: of Agatha Christie---person%1:03:00:: and Dorothy Sayers---person%1:03:00:: ) have retained Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: ' egotism---egotism%1:07:00:: but not his zest---zest%1:12:00:: for life---life%1:09:00:: and eccentric habits---habit%1:04:02:: .
Poirot---person%1:03:00:: and his counterparts---counterpart%1:09:00:: are perfectly respectable people---people%1:14:00:: ; it is true that they are also extremely dull .
Their dedication---dedication%1:07:00:: to the status quo---status_quo%1:26:00:: has been affirmed at the expense---expense%1:11:00:: of the fascinating but dangerous individualism---individualism%1:07:00:: of a Sherlock Holmes---sherlock_holmes%1:18:00:: .
The latter 's real descendents---descendent%1:18:00:: were unable to take root in England---england%1:15:00:: ; they fled from the Victorian parlor---parlor%1:06:01:: and made their way across the stormy Atlantic---atlantic%1:17:00:: .
In the American `` hardboiled '' detective story---detective_story%1:10:00:: of the ' 20 s and ' 30 s , the spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: of the mad genius---genius%1:18:00:: from Baker Street---location%1:03:00:: lives on .
Like Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: , the American private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: rejects the social conventions---convention%1:09:00:: of his time---time%1:28:00:: .
But unlike Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: , he feels his society---society%1:14:00:: to be not merely dull but also corrupt .
Surrounded by crime---crime%1:04:00:: and violence---violence%1:04:01:: everywhere , the `` hardboiled '' private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: can retain his purity---purity%1:26:02:: only through a life---life%1:26:02:: of self-imposed isolation .
His alienation---alienation%1:12:00:: is far more acute than Holmes---holmes%1:18:00:: ' ; he is not an eccentric---eccentric%1:18:00:: but rather an outcast---outcast%1:18:00:: .
With Rex Stout---person%1:03:00:: 's Nero Wolfe---person%1:03:00:: , alienation---alienation%1:12:00:: is represented on a purely physical plane---plane%1:26:00:: .
Wolfe---person%1:03:00:: refuses to ever leave his own house---house%1:06:00:: , and spends most of his time---time%1:28:05:: drinking beer---beer%1:13:00:: and playing with orchids---orchid%1:20:00:: .
More profound and more disturbing , however , is the moral isolation---isolation%1:12:00:: of Raymond Chandler---person%1:03:00:: 's Philip Marlowe---person%1:03:00:: .
In a society---society%1:14:00:: where everything is for sale , Marlowe---person%1:03:00:: is the only man---man%1:18:04:: who cannot be bought .
His tough honesty---honesty%1:07:00:: condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
Beaten , bruised and exhausted , he pursues the elusive killer---killer%1:18:00:: through the demi-monde---demimonde%1:14:00:: of high society---high_society%1:14:00:: and low morals---morals%1:16:00:: , always alone , always despised .
In the end , he gets his man---man%1:18:04:: , but no one seems to care ; virtue---virtue%1:07:01:: is its own and only reward---reward%1:11:00:: .
A similar tone---tone%1:26:01:: of underlying futility---futility%1:07:00:: and despair---despair%1:26:00:: pervades the spy---spy%1:18:00:: thrillers---thriller%1:10:00:: of Eric Ambler---person%1:03:00:: and dominates the most famous of all American mystery stories---mystery_story%1:10:00:: , Dashiell Hammett---person%1:03:00:: 's The Maltese Falcon .
Sam Spade---person%1:03:00:: joins forces with a band---band%1:14:01:: of adventurers---adventurer%1:18:00:: in search---search%1:04:00:: of a priceless jeweled statue---statue%1:06:00:: of a falcon---falcon%1:05:00:: ; but when the bird is found at last , it turns out to be a fake---fake%1:06:00:: .
Now the detective---detective%1:18:00:: must save his own skin---skin%1:26:00:: by informing on the girl---girl%1:18:00:: he loves , who is also the real murderer---murderer%1:18:00:: .
For Sam Spade---person%1:03:00:: , neither crime---crime%1:04:00:: nor virtue---virtue%1:07:01:: pays ; moreover , it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two .
Because the private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: intends to save society---society%1:14:00:: in spite of himself , he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police---police%1:14:00:: .
The latter are either too stupid to catch the killer---killer%1:18:00:: or too corrupt to care .
In either case---case%1:26:00:: , they do not appreciate the private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: 's zeal---zeal%1:12:01:: .
Perry Mason---person%1:03:00:: and Hamilton Burger---person%1:03:00:: , Nero Wolfe---person%1:03:00:: and Inspector Cramer---person%1:03:00:: spend more time---time%1:28:05:: fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal---criminal%1:18:00:: .
Frequently enough , the police---police%1:14:00:: are themselves in league with the killer---killer%1:18:00:: ; Dashiell Hammett---person%1:03:00:: 's Red Harvest provides a classic example---example%1:09:00:: of this theme---theme%1:09:01:: .
But even when the police---police%1:14:00:: are honest , they do not trust the private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: .
He is , like Phillip Marlowe---person%1:03:00:: , too alienated to be reliable .
Finally , in The Maltese Falcon among others , the clash---clash%1:26:00:: between detective---detective%1:18:00:: and police---police%1:14:00:: is carried to its logical conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: : Sam Spade---person%1:03:00:: becomes the chief murder suspect---murder_suspect%1:18:00:: .
In order to exonerate himself , he is compelled to find the real criminal---criminal%1:18:00:: , who happens to be his girl friend---girlfriend%1:18:00:: .
What was only a vague suspicion---suspicion%1:09:01:: in the case---case%1:26:00:: of Sherlock Holmes---sherlock_holmes%1:18:00:: now appears as a direct accusation---accusation%1:10:00:: : the private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: is in danger---danger%1:26:00:: of turning into his opposite---opposite%1:18:00:: .
It is the growing contradiction---contradiction%1:24:00:: between individualism---individualism%1:07:00:: and public service---service%1:04:00:: in the mystery story---mystery_story%1:10:00:: which creates this fatal dilemma---dilemma%1:09:00:: .
By upholding his own personal code of behavior---code_of_behavior%1:09:00:: , the private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: has placed himself in opposition---opposition%1:24:02:: to a society---society%1:14:00:: whose fabric---fabric%1:07:00:: is permeated with crime---crime%1:04:00:: and corruption---corruption%1:07:00:: .
That society---society%1:14:00:: responds by condemning the private eye---private_eye%1:18:00:: as a threat---threat%1:26:00:: to the status quo---status_quo%1:26:00:: , a potential criminal---criminal%1:18:00:: .
If the detective---detective%1:18:00:: insists upon retaining his personal standards---standard%1:09:00:: , he must now do so in conscious defiance---defiance%1:10:00:: of his society---society%1:14:00:: .
He must , in short , cease to be a detective---detective%1:18:00:: and become a rebel---rebel%1:18:01:: .
On the other hand , if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession---profession%1:04:00:: , he must abandon his own code---code%1:10:01:: and sacrifice his precious individualism---individualism%1:07:00:: .
Dashiell Hammett---person%1:03:00:: resolved this contradiction---contradiction%1:24:00:: by ceasing to write mystery stories---mystery_story%1:10:00:: and turning to other pursuits---pursuit%1:09:00:: .
His successors---successor%1:18:01:: have adopted the opposite alternative---alternative%1:09:00:: .
In order to save the mystery story---mystery_story%1:10:00:: , they have converted the private detective---private_detective%1:18:00:: into an organization---organization%1:14:01:: man---man%1:18:04:: .
The first---first%1:23:00:: of two possible variations---variation%1:06:00:: on this theme---theme%1:09:01:: is symbolized by Mickey Spillane---person%1:03:00:: 's Mike Hammer---person%1:03:00:: .
At first glance , this hero---hero%1:09:00:: seems to be more rather than less of an individualist---individualist%1:18:00:: than any of his predecessors---predecessor%1:18:00:: .
For Hammer---person%1:03:00:: , nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: is forbidden .
He kills when he pleases , takes his women---woman%1:18:00:: where he finds them and always acts as judge---judge%1:18:00:: , jury---jury%1:14:00:: and executioner---executioner%1:18:00:: rolled into one .
His son---son%1:18:00:: watched until he got as far as the hall---hall%1:06:03:: , almost out of sight , then hurried after .
`` Dad---dad%1:18:00:: .
Dad---dad%1:18:00:: , wait '' .
He caught up with the old man---old_man%1:18:02:: in the living room---living_room%1:06:00:: .
Old man Arthur---person%1:03:00:: had put down the suitcase---suitcase%1:06:00:: to open the front door---front_door%1:06:00:: .
`` Just this one favor---favor%1:04:00:: , Dad---dad%1:18:00:: .
Just do n't tell Ferguson---person%1:03:00:: that crazy opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: of yours '' .
The old man---old_man%1:18:02:: gave the room---room%1:06:00:: a stare---stare%1:04:00:: in leaving ; under the scraggly brows---brow%1:08:01:: the pale old eyes---eye%1:08:00:: burned with a bitter memory---memory%1:09:02:: .
`` It 's the truth---truth%1:09:00:: '' .
`` The Bartlett---person%1:03:00:: girl---girl%1:18:00:: was killed by Mr. Dronk---person%1:03:00:: 's son---son%1:18:00:: .
Rossi---person%1:03:00:: and Ferguson---person%1:03:00:: have been across the street---street%1:06:00:: , talking to the kid---kid%1:18:00:: .
They 've found some sort---sort%1:09:00:: of new evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: , a bundle---bundle%1:14:00:: of clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: or something , and it must link the kid---kid%1:18:00:: even stronger to the crime---crime%1:04:00:: .
Why won n't you accept facts---fact%1:09:01:: ?
The two kids---kid%1:18:00:: were together a lot , they were having some kind---kind%1:09:00:: of teen-age affair---affair%1:26:00:: - God knows how far that had gone - and the kid---kid%1:18:00:: 's crippled .
He limps , and the man---man%1:18:00:: who hit you and took the cane---cane%1:06:01:: , he limped .
His father---father%1:18:00:: looked him over closely .
`` You sound like an old woman---old_woman%1:18:00:: .
You should have gone to work---work%1:06:01:: today , ' stead of sneaking around spying on the Dronk---person%1:03:00:: house---house%1:06:00:: '' .
`` The trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: with you '' , old man Arthur---person%1:03:00:: began , and then checked himself .
Young Mrs. Arthur---person%1:03:00:: had opened the oven---oven%1:06:00:: and there was a drifting odor---odor%1:09:00:: of hot biscuits---biscuit%1:13:00:: .
The old man---old_man%1:18:02:: opened the door---door%1:06:00:: and stepped out into the sunlight---sunlight%1:19:00:: .
`` Is n't enough time---time%1:28:05:: to go into it '' , he finished , and slammed the door---door%1:06:00:: in his son---son%1:18:00:: 's face---face%1:08:00:: .
Mrs. Holden---person%1:03:00:: turned from the window---window%1:06:00:: draperies---drapery%1:06:00:: .
`` They found something else up there '' , she said half aloud to the empty room---room%1:06:00:: .
`` They took it away , overalls---overall%1:06:00:: or something '' .
She walked restlessly across the room---room%1:06:00:: , then back to the windows---window%1:06:00:: .
`` Now they 've gone , they did n't come back , and they did n't arrest that Dronk---person%1:03:00:: boy---boy%1:18:00:: '' .
She stood frowning and chewing her lip---lip%1:08:00:: .
She was wearing a brown cotton---cotton%1:06:00:: dress---dress%1:06:00:: , cut across the hips---hip%1:08:00:: in a way---way%1:07:01:: that was supposed to make her look slimmer , a yoke---yoke%1:06:01:: set into the skirt---skirt%1:06:01:: and flaring pleats---pleat%1:06:00:: below .
She smoothed the skirt---skirt%1:06:01:: , sat down , then stood up and went back to the windows---window%1:06:00:: .
`` Why on earth did I send him off to work---work%1:06:01:: ?
There was excuse---excuse%1:10:00:: enough to keep him home , that young Mr. Arthur---person%1:03:00:: 's still over there '' .
With sudden energy---energy%1:07:00:: , she went to the phone---phone%1:06:00:: and rang Holden---person%1:03:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: and asked for him .
`` Mae---person%1:03:00:: , we 're so busy .
Mr. Crosson---person%1:03:00:: 's been on everybody 's neck , an order---order%1:10:01:: he expected did n't come through and he 's '' -
I 'm all alone and certain things---thing%1:26:00:: are going on that look very ominous .
His voice---voice%1:07:00:: grew high and trembling .
`` I can n't be underfoot every time---time%1:11:00:: those cops---cop%1:18:00:: turn around !
He could n't see the grin---grin%1:10:00:: that split her mouth---mouth%1:08:00:: ; the teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: that shone into the phone---phone%1:06:00:: were like a shark---shark%1:05:00:: 's .
You can n't wander along in the dark---dark%1:09:00:: , can you ?
They found some clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: '' , she .
Deliberately , she ignored the yelp---yelp%1:11:00:: .
`` Also , that Mr. Ferguson---person%1:03:00:: was here .
I guess he wants to ask you some questions---question%1:10:00:: .
She slapped the receiver---receiver%1:06:01:: into its holder---holder%1:06:00:: and stepped away .
Her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: were bright with anticipation---anticipation%1:12:00:: .
In his office---office%1:06:00:: , Mr. Holden---person%1:03:00:: replaced the phone---phone%1:06:00:: slowly .
He rose from his chair---chair%1:06:00:: .
He had to cough then ; he went to the window---window%1:06:00:: and choked there with the fresh breeze---breeze%1:19:00:: on his face---face%1:08:00:: .
He got his hat---hat%1:06:00:: out of the closet---closet%1:06:03:: .
For a moment---moment%1:28:01:: he thought of going into Crosson---person%1:03:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: to explain that he had to leave , but there was now such a pain---pain%1:26:00:: in his chest---chest%1:08:00:: , such a pounding---pounding%1:11:01:: in his head---head%1:08:00:: , that he decided to let it go .
He passed the receptionist---receptionist%1:18:00:: in the outer office---office%1:06:00:: , muttering , `` I 've got to go out for a little while---while%1:28:00:: '' .
Let her call Crosson---person%1:03:00:: if she wanted to , let Crosson---person%1:03:00:: raise the roof or even can him , he did n't care .
He got into the car---car%1:06:00:: .
Putting the key---key%1:06:00:: into the switch---switch%1:06:01:: , pressing the accelerator---accelerator%1:06:02:: with his foot---foot%1:08:01:: , putting the car---car%1:06:00:: into reverse---reverse%1:06:00:: , seemed vast endeavors---endeavor%1:04:01:: almost beyond the ability---ability%1:07:00:: of his shaking body---body%1:08:00:: .
Once out in the street---street%1:06:00:: , the traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: was a gadfly---gadfly%1:18:00:: maze---maze%1:06:00:: in which he wandered stricken .
When he turned into the highway---highway%1:06:00:: that led to the outskirts---outskirts%1:15:00:: of the city---city%1:15:00:: and then rose toward home---home%1:15:04:: , he had to pull over to the curb---curb%1:06:00:: and wait for a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: , sucking in air---air%1:27:00:: and squinting and blinking his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: to clear them of tears---tear%1:08:01:: .
What on earth was in Mae---person%1:03:00:: 's mind---mind%1:09:01:: , that she wanted him up there spying on what the cops---cop%1:18:00:: were doing ?
He tried to ignore what his own common sense---common_sense%1:09:00:: told him , but it was n't possible ; her motives---motive%1:03:00:: were too blatant .
She wanted the police---police%1:14:00:: to notice him , suspect him .
She was going to keep on scheming , poking , prodding , suggesting , and dictating until the cops---cop%1:18:00:: got up enough interest---interest%1:09:00:: in him to go back to their old neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: and ask questions---question%1:10:00:: .
And he knew in that moment---moment%1:28:01:: , with a cold sinking---sinking%1:11:00:: of despair---despair%1:26:00:: , a dying---dying%1:28:00:: of old hopes---hope%1:12:01:: , that Mae---person%1:03:00:: had spread some kind---kind%1:09:00:: of word---word%1:10:02:: there among the neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: .
They 'd have some suspicions---suspicion%1:09:01:: to repeat to the police---police%1:14:00:: .
Though his inner thoughts---thought%1:09:00:: cringed at it , he forced himself to think back , recreating the scene---scene%1:11:00:: in which Mae---person%1:03:00:: claimed to have caught him molesting the child---child%1:18:00:: .
There had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions---intention%1:09:00:: .
A second scene---scene%1:11:00:: flashed before his mind---mind%1:09:01:: , the interior---interior%1:15:01:: of the garage---garage%1:06:00:: at the new house---house%1:06:00:: and the young Bartlett---person%1:03:00:: girl---girl%1:18:02:: turning startled to meet him , the dim dark---dark%1:26:00:: and the sudden confusion---confusion%1:09:00:: and fear---fear%1:12:00:: and then the brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: as Mae---person%1:03:00:: had clicked on the light---light%1:06:00:: .
Suppose the cops---cop%1:18:00:: somehow got hold---hold%1:09:00:: of that ?
Well , it had n't been what it seemed , he 'd had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: the girl---girl%1:18:02:: was in there .
And when he came to examine the scene---scene%1:11:00:: , there was a certain staginess---staginess%1:07:00:: to it , it had the smell---smell%1:26:00:: of planning---planning%1:04:00:: , and a swift suspicion---suspicion%1:09:01:: darted into his mind---mind%1:09:01:: .
Mae---person%1:03:00:: would n't have plotted a thing---thing%1:04:00:: like that .
It was just that little accidents---accident%1:11:00:: played into her hands .
Like this murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
He leaned on the wheel---wheel%1:06:05:: , clutching it , staring into the sunlight---sunlight%1:19:00:: , and tried to bring order---order%1:26:02:: into his thoughts---thought%1:09:00:: .
There was no use---use%1:07:02:: wandering off into a territory---territory%1:09:00:: of utter nightmare---nightmare%1:26:00:: .
Mae---person%1:03:00:: was his wife---wife%1:18:00:: .
She would n't be wilfully planning his destruction---destruction%1:04:00:: .
Even as the conviction---conviction%1:09:00:: of truth---truth%1:26:00:: roared through him , shattering his last hope---hope%1:12:01:: of safety---safety%1:26:00:: , he was reaching to release the hand brake---hand_brake%1:06:00:: , to head up the road---road%1:06:00:: for home---home%1:15:04:: , doing her bidding---bidding%1:10:02:: .
He drove , and the road---road%1:06:00:: wobbled , familiar scenes---scene%1:09:00:: crept past on either side---side%1:15:02:: .
He came to a stretch---stretch%1:17:00:: of old orange---orange%1:20:00:: groves---grove%1:06:00:: , the trees---tree%1:20:00:: dead , some of them uprooted , and then there was an outlying shopping---shopping%1:04:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: , and tract---tract%1:15:00:: houses---house%1:06:00:: .
He had the feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: that he should abandon the car---car%1:06:00:: and run off somewhere to hide .
There was really no place---place%1:15:00:: to go , finally , except home to Mae---person%1:03:00:: .
At the gate---gate%1:06:00:: he slowed , looking around .
Cooper---person%1:03:00:: was beside his car---car%1:06:00:: , on the curb---curb%1:06:00:: at the right---right%1:15:00:: , just standing there morosely ; he did n't even look up .
Behind him on the steps---steps%1:06:00:: of the little office---office%1:06:00:: sat old man Arthur---person%1:03:00:: ; he was straight , something angry in his attitude---attitude%1:07:01:: , as if he might be waiting to report something .
Holden---person%1:03:00:: stepped on the gas---gas%1:06:00:: .
A new idea---idea%1:09:00:: drifted in from nowhere .
He could go to the police---police%1:14:00:: .
He could tell them his fears---fear%1:12:00:: of being involved , he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: and how Mae---person%1:03:00:: had misunderstood and how she had held it over him - the scene---scene%1:11:00:: was complete in his mind---mind%1:09:01:: at the moment---moment%1:28:00:: , even to his own jerkings---jerking%1:04:00:: and snivelings---sniveling%1:04:00:: , and Ferguson---person%1:03:00:: 's silent patience---patience%1:07:00:: .
He could throw himself on the mercy---mercy%1:04:00:: of the Police Department---police_department%1:14:00:: .
It was n't what Mae---person%1:03:00:: would want him to do , though .
Once he had abandoned himself to the very worst---worst%1:11:00:: , once he had quieted all the dragons---dragon%1:18:02:: of worry---worry%1:12:00:: and suspense---suspense%1:12:02:: , there would n't be very much---much%1:23:00:: for Mae---person%1:03:00:: to do .
At that moment---moment%1:28:00:: , Holden---person%1:03:00:: almost slammed on the brakes---brakes%1:06:00:: to go back to Cooper---person%1:03:00:: and ask if Ferguson---person%1:03:00:: was about .
It would be such a relief---relief%1:11:00:: .
What was that old sign---sign%1:10:00:: , supposed to be painted over a door---door%1:06:01:: somewhere , Abandon hope---hope%1:12:00:: , all ye who enter here ?
Why , Holden---person%1:03:00:: said to himself , surprised at his own sudden insight---insight%1:09:01:: , I 'll bet some of those people---people%1:14:00:: who enter are just as happy as can be .
They 've worried , they 've lain awake nights---night%1:28:00:: , they 've shook at the slightest footstep---footstep%1:11:00:: , they 've pictured their own destruction---destruction%1:04:00:: , and now it 's all over and they can give up .
Sure , they 're giving up hope---hope%1:12:00:: .
Hand in hand with hope---hope%1:12:00:: went things---thing%1:07:00:: like terror---terror%1:12:00:: and apprehension---apprehension%1:12:00:: .
Holden---person%1:03:00:: waved a hand---hand%1:08:00:: at the empty street---street%1:06:00:: .
He drove into the paved space---space%1:15:00:: before the garage---garage%1:06:00:: and got out , slamming the car door---car_door%1:06:00:: .
He looked up and down the street---street%1:06:00:: .
If Ferguson---person%1:03:00:: 's car---car%1:06:00:: had been in sight , Holden---person%1:03:00:: would have walked directly to it .
He went to the front door---front_door%1:06:00:: and opened it and looked in .
Mae---person%1:03:00:: entered the room---room%1:06:00:: from the hallway---hallway%1:06:00:: to the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: .
She had a cup---cup%1:06:00:: of something steaming , coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: perhaps , in one hand---hand%1:08:00:: , a fresh piece---piece%1:06:05:: of toast---toast%1:13:00:: in the other .
She stood there , watching Holden---person%1:03:00:: come in , and she put the piece---piece%1:06:05:: of toast---toast%1:13:00:: in her mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: and bit off one corner---corner%1:17:00:: with a huge chomp---chomp%1:04:00:: of her white teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: .
`` Mae---person%1:03:00:: '' -
`` I 've been thinking '' , she said , swallowing the toast---toast%1:13:00:: .
`` Did n't you have an old pair---pair%1:14:01:: of painting---painting%1:04:02:: overalls---overall%1:06:00:: in the garage---garage%1:06:00:: ?
You used them that time---time%1:11:00:: you painted the porch---porch%1:06:00:: at our other house---house%1:06:00:: .
And then you wiped up some grease---grease%1:27:00:: '' .
She had caught him off guard , no preparation---preparation%1:09:00:: , nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: certain but that ahead lay some kind---kind%1:09:00:: of disaster---disaster%1:26:00:: .
Wait a minute---minute%1:28:00:: .
I 'm sure they were in the garage---garage%1:06:00:: up until a couple of days---day%1:28:00:: ago .
Or even yesterday---yesterday%1:28:01:: .
You used to paint in them , and then you just took them for rags---rag%1:06:00:: .
The police---police%1:14:00:: have them now '' .
`` I do n't remember any overalls---overall%1:06:00:: at all '' .
Worn through at the knees---knee%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Green paint---paint%1:06:00:: , was n't it ?
Well , I 'm not sure of the color---color%1:07:00:: .
`` Mae---person%1:03:00:: , sit down .
Put down the cup---cup%1:06:00:: of coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: .
She shook her head---head%1:08:00:: .
She took another bite---bite%1:13:01:: of toast---toast%1:13:00:: .
Holden---person%1:03:00:: noticed almost absently how she chewed , how the whole side---side%1:15:00:: of her cheek---cheek%1:08:00:: moved , a slab---slab%1:06:00:: of fat---fat%1:08:00:: that extended down into her neck---neck%1:08:00:: .
You 're going to have to go to the police---police%1:14:00:: and explain what happened .
Tell them the truth---truth%1:10:00:: , or something , before they come here '' .
A seeping coldness---coldness%1:07:01:: entered Holden---person%1:03:00:: 's being---being%1:26:00:: ; his nerves---nerve%1:08:00:: seemed frost-bitten down to the tips---tip%1:15:00:: of his tingling fingers---finger%1:08:00:: and his spine---spine%1:08:00:: felt stiff and glass---glass%1:27:00:: like , liable to break like an icicle---icicle%1:27:00:: at any moment---moment%1:28:00:: .
`` I 've never owned any painting---painting%1:04:02:: overalls---overall%1:06:00:: .
Does our society---society%1:14:00:: have a runaway , uncontrollable growth---growth%1:22:01:: of technology---technology%1:04:00:: which may end our civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: , or a normal , healthy growth---growth%1:22:01:: ?
Here there may be an analogy with cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: : we can detect cancers---cancer%1:26:00:: by their rapidly accelerating growth---growth%1:22:00:: , determinable only when related to the more normal rate---rate%1:28:00:: of healthy growth---growth%1:22:00:: .
Should the accelerating growth---growth%1:22:01:: of technology---technology%1:04:00:: then warn us ?
Noting such evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: is the first step---first_step%1:04:00:: ; and almost the only `` cure---cure%1:06:00:: '' is early detection---detection%1:09:00:: and removal---removal%1:04:00:: .
One way---way%1:04:01:: to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology---technology%1:04:00:: would be to check the strength---strength%1:07:00:: of our society---society%1:14:00:: 's organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before .
So an objective look---look%1:07:01:: at our present procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
In any event , whether society---society%1:14:00:: may have cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: , or merely a virus---virus%1:05:00:: infection---infection%1:26:00:: , the `` disease---disease%1:26:00:: '' , we shall find , is political , economical , social , and even medical .
Have not our physical abilities---physical_ability%1:07:00:: already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives---life%1:26:01:: we are now living ?
Hence the prime issue---issue%1:09:01:: , as I see it , is whether a democratic or free society---society%1:14:00:: can master technology---technology%1:04:00:: for the benefit---benefit%1:07:00:: of mankind , or whether technology---technology%1:04:00:: will rule and develop its own society---society%1:14:00:: compatible with its own needs---need%1:17:00:: as a force---force%1:07:01:: of nature---nature%1:18:00:: .
We are already committed to establishing man 's supremacy---supremacy%1:26:00:: over nature---nature%1:18:00:: and everywhere on earth---earth%1:17:00:: , not merely in the limited social political economical context---context%1:26:00:: we are fond of today---today%1:28:00:: .
Otherwise , we go on endlessly trying to draw the line , color---color%1:14:00:: and other , as to which kind of man---man%1:18:04:: we wish to see dominate .
We have proved so able to solve technological problems---problem%1:26:00:: that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal---goal%1:09:00:: in the immediate future---future%1:28:00:: is to be extremely shortsighted , if nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: else .
We must believe we have the ability---ability%1:07:00:: to affect our own destinies---destiny%1:11:00:: : otherwise why try anything ?
So in these pages the term `` technology '' is used to include any and all means which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control---control%1:07:01:: over himself and over other men .
So in these pages---page%1:10:00:: the term---term%1:10:00:: `` technology---technology%1:04:00:: '' is used to include any and all means---means%1:06:00:: which could amplify , project , or augment man 's control---control%1:07:00:: over himself and over other men---man%1:18:04:: .
Naturally this includes all communication forms , e. g. languages , or any social , political , economic or religious structures employed for such control---control%1:07:01:: .

Properly mindful of all the cultures---culture%1:14:00:: in existence---existence%1:26:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: throughout the world , we must employ these resources---resource%1:07:00:: without war---war%1:04:00:: or violent revolution---revolution%1:04:00:: .
Properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world , we must employ these resources---resource%1:21:00:: without war or violent revolution .
If we were creating a wholly new society---society%1:14:00:: , we could insist that our social , political , economic and philosophic institutions---institution%1:14:00:: foster rather than hamper man ; best growth---growth%1:22:01:: .
But we cannot start off with a clean slate---clean_slate%1:26:00:: .
So we must first analyze our present institutions---institution%1:14:00:: with respect to the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of each on man 's major needs---need%1:17:00:: .
Asked which institution---institution%1:14:00:: most needs correction---correction%1:04:00:: , I would say the corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: as it exists in America---america%1:15:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: .
At first glance this appears strange : of all people---people%1:14:01:: , was not America---america%1:15:00:: founded by rugged individualists who established a new way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: still inspiring `` undeveloped '' societies---society%1:14:00:: abroad ?
But hear Harrison E. Salisbury---person%1:03:00:: , former Moscow---moscow%1:15:00:: correspondent---correspondent%1:18:01:: of The New York Times---group%1:03:00:: , and author---author%1:18:00:: of `` To Moscow - And Beyond '' .
In a book---book%1:10:00:: review---review%1:10:01:: of `` The Soviet Cultural Offensive '' , he says , `` Long before the State Department---state_department%1:14:00:: organized its bureaucracy---bureaucracy%1:14:00:: into an East-West Contacts Staff---group%1:03:00:: in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive---counteroffensive%1:04:00:: within Soviet borders---border%1:15:00:: , the sharp cutting-edge---cutting_edge%1:09:00:: of American culture---culture%1:09:00:: had carved its mark---mark%1:10:02:: across the Russian steppes---steppe%1:17:00:: , as when the enterprising promoters---promoter%1:18:00:: of ' Porgy and Bess ' overrode the State Department---state_department%1:14:00:: to carry the contemporary ' cultural warfare---warfare%1:04:00:: ' behind the enemy---enemy%1:14:01:: lines---line%1:14:03:: .
They were not diplomats---diplomat%1:18:00:: or jazz musicians---jazz_musician%1:18:00:: , or even organizers---organizer%1:18:00:: of reading-rooms---reading_room%1:06:00:: and photo montage---photomontage%1:06:00:: displays---display%1:04:00:: , but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs---entrepreneur%1:18:00:: like Henry Ford---henry_ford%1:18:00:: , Hugh Cooper---person%1:03:00:: , Thomas Campbell---person%1:03:00:: , the International Harvester Co.---group%1:03:00:: , and David W. Griffith---person%1:03:00:: .
Their kind---kind%1:09:00:: created an American culture---culture%1:09:00:: superior to any in the world , an industrial and technological culture---culture%1:09:00:: which penetrated Russia---russia%1:15:00:: as it did almost every corner---corner%1:15:02:: of the earth---earth%1:17:00:: without a nickel---nickel%1:21:00:: from the Federal treasury---treasury%1:21:00:: or a single governmental specialist---specialist%1:18:00:: to contrive directives---directive%1:10:00:: or program a series---series%1:14:00:: of consultations---consultation%1:10:01:: of interested agencies---agency%1:14:00:: .
This favorable image---image%1:09:00:: of America---america%1:15:00:: in the minds---mind%1:09:00:: of Russian men---man%1:18:00:: and women---woman%1:18:00:: is still there despite years---years%1:28:01:: of energetic anti American propaganda---propaganda%1:10:00:: '' .
Perhaps the public---public%1:14:00:: 's present attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: toward business---business%1:04:01:: stems from the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that the `` rugged capitalist entrepreneur---entrepreneur%1:18:00:: '' no more exists in America---america%1:15:00:: .
In his stead---stead%1:04:00:: is a milquetoast---milquetoast%1:18:00:: version---version%1:09:01:: known as `` the corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: '' .
But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics---characteristic%1:07:00:: in this new image---image%1:07:00:: of America---america%1:15:00:: , foreigners---foreigner%1:18:00:: can ; and our loss---loss%1:07:00:: of `` prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: '' abroad is the direct result---result%1:19:00:: .
No amount---amount%1:07:00:: of ballyhoo---ballyhoo%1:10:00:: will cover up the sordid facts---fact%1:09:01:: .
If we want respect---respect%1:09:01:: from ourselves or others , we will have to earn it .
First , let us realize that whatever good---good%1:07:00:: this set-up---setup%1:06:00:: achieved in earlier times---time%1:28:00:: , now the corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: per se cannot take economic leadership---leadership%1:04:00:: .
Businesses---business%1:14:00:: must develop as a result---result%1:19:00:: of the ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , energies---energy%1:07:02:: and ambitions---ambition%1:12:00:: of an individual---individual%1:03:00:: having purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: and comprehensive ability---ability%1:09:00:: within one mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
When we `` forced '' individuals---individual%1:03:00:: to assume the corporate structure---structure%1:07:00:: by means---means%1:04:00:: of taxes---tax%1:21:00:: and other legal statutes---statute%1:10:00:: , we adopted what I would term `` pseudo capitalism---capitalism%1:14:00:: '' and so took a major step---step%1:04:02:: toward socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: .
The biggest loss---loss%1:07:00:: , of course , was the individual---individual%1:03:00:: 's lessened desire---desire%1:07:00:: and ability---ability%1:07:00:: to give his services---services%1:04:00:: to the growth---growth%1:22:01:: of his company---company%1:14:01:: and our economy---economy%1:14:00:: .
Socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: , I grant , has a definite place---place%1:09:00:: in our society---society%1:14:00:: .
But let us not complain of the evils---evil%1:07:02:: of capitalism---capitalism%1:14:00:: by referring to a form---form%1:09:01:: that is not truly capitalistic .
Some forms---form%1:09:01:: of capitalism---capitalism%1:14:00:: do indeed work - superb organizations---organization%1:14:01:: , a credit---credit%1:04:01:: to any society---society%1:14:00:: .
But the pseudo capitalism---capitalism%1:14:00:: which dictates our whole economy---economy%1:14:00:: as well as our politics---politics%1:24:00:: and social life---life%1:26:01:: , will not stand close scrutiny---scrutiny%1:04:00:: .
Its pretense---pretense%1:04:00:: to operate in the public interest---interest%1:07:01:: is little more than a sham---sham%1:06:00:: .
It serves only its own stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: and poorly at that .
As a creative enterprise---enterprise%1:14:00:: , its abilities---ability%1:07:00:: are primarily in `` swallowing '' creative enterprises---enterprise%1:14:00:: developed outside its own organization---organization%1:14:00:: ( an ability---ability%1:07:00:: made possible by us , and almost mandatory ) .
As to benefits---benefit%1:07:00:: to employees---employee%1:18:00:: , it is notorious for its callous disregard---disregard%1:04:01:: except where it depends on them for services---services%1:04:00:: .
The corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: in America---america%1:15:00:: is in reality our form---form%1:09:01:: of socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: , vying in a sense with the other socialistic form---form%1:09:01:: that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy---bureaucracy%1:14:00:: .
But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization---organization%1:14:01:: ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism , the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole .
But while the corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: has all the disadvantages---disadvantage%1:07:00:: of the socialist form---form%1:09:01:: of organization---organization%1:09:00:: ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need---need%1:03:00:: to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo---status_quo%1:26:00:: ) , unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect---aspect%1:07:02:: of socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: , the motivation---motivation%1:03:00:: to operate for the benefit---benefit%1:07:00:: of society---society%1:14:00:: as a whole .
So we are faced with a vast network---network%1:14:00:: of amorphous entities---entity%1:03:00:: perpetuating themselves in whatever manner---manner%1:07:01:: they can , without regard to the needs---need%1:17:00:: of society---society%1:14:00:: , controlling society---society%1:14:00:: and forcing upon it a regime---regime%1:09:00:: representing only the corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: 's needs---need%1:17:00:: for survival---survival%1:26:00:: .
The corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: has a limited , specific place---place%1:09:00:: in our society---society%1:14:00:: .
Ideally speaking , it should be allowed to operate only where the public---public%1:14:00:: has a great stake---stake%1:21:02:: in the continuity---continuity%1:26:00:: of supply---supply%1:23:00:: or services---services%1:04:00:: , and where the actions---action%1:04:02:: of a single proprietor---proprietor%1:18:00:: are secondary to the needs---need%1:17:00:: of society---society%1:14:00:: .
Examples---example%1:09:02:: are in public utilities---utility%1:14:00:: , making military aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: and accessories---accessory%1:06:00:: , or where the investment---investment%1:04:00:: and risk---risk%1:04:00:: for a proprietorship---proprietorship%1:21:00:: would be too great for a much needed project---project%1:04:00:: impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form---form%1:09:01:: , e. g. constructing major airports---airport%1:06:00:: or dams---dam%1:06:00:: .
Thus , if corporations are not to run away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions , subject to public control---control%1:24:00:: and needs .
Thus , if corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: are not to run away with us , they must become quasi governmental institutions---institution%1:14:00:: , subject to public control---control%1:07:00:: and needs---need%1:17:00:: .
In all other areas---area%1:26:00:: , private initiative---initiative%1:07:00:: of the `` proprietorship---proprietorship%1:21:00:: '' type---type%1:09:00:: should be urged to produce the desired goods and services---services%1:04:00:: .
Avoiding runaway technology---technology%1:04:00:: can be done only by assuring a humane society---society%1:14:00:: ; and for this human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: must be firmly in control---control%1:07:00:: of the economics---economics%1:09:00:: on which our society---society%1:14:00:: rests .
Avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human beings must be firmly in control---control%1:24:00:: of the economics on which our society rests .
Such genuine human leadership---leadership%1:09:00:: the proprietorship---proprietorship%1:21:00:: can offer , corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: cannot .
It can project long-range goals---goal%1:09:00:: for itself .
Corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: react violently to short-range stimuli---stimulus%1:09:00:: , e. g. , quarterly and annual dividend---dividend%1:21:00:: reports---report%1:10:03:: .
Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control---control%1:24:00:: ; corporations , being more amorphous , cannot .
Proprietorships---proprietorship%1:21:00:: can establish a unity---unity%1:26:00:: and integrity---integrity%1:26:00:: of control---control%1:07:00:: ; corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: , being more amorphous , cannot .
Proprietorships---proprietorship%1:21:00:: can establish a meaningful identity---identity%1:09:00:: , representing a human personality---personality%1:07:00:: , and thus establish sincere relationships---relationship%1:24:00:: with customers---customer%1:18:00:: and community---community%1:14:00:: .
Corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: are apt by nature to be impersonal , inhumane , shortsighted and almost exclusively profit---profit%1:21:00:: motivated , a picture---picture%1:09:00:: they could scarcely afford to present to the public---public%1:14:00:: .
The proprietor---proprietor%1:18:00:: is able to create a leadership---leadership%1:09:00:: impossible in the corporate structure---structure%1:06:00:: with its board of directors---board_of_directors%1:14:00:: and stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: .
Leadership---leadership%1:26:00:: is lacking in our society---society%1:14:00:: because it has no legitimate place---place%1:09:00:: to develop .
Men---man%1:18:00:: continuously at the head---head%1:18:00:: of growing enterprises---enterprise%1:14:00:: can acquire experiences---experience%1:09:01:: of the most varied , complicated and trying type---type%1:09:00:: so that at maturation---maturation%1:22:01:: they have developed the competence---competence%1:07:00:: and willingness---willingness%1:07:00:: to accept the personal responsibility---responsibility%1:07:00:: so sorely needed now .
Hence government---government%1:14:00:: must establish greater controls---control%1:24:00:: upon corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: so that their activities---activity%1:04:00:: promote what is deemed essential to the national interest---interest%1:07:01:: .
Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations , e. g. the chance to accumulate capital---capital%1:21:01:: so vital for growth .
Proprietorships---proprietorship%1:21:00:: should get the tax advantages---tax_advantage%1:21:00:: now accruing to corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: , e. g. the chance---chance%1:26:00:: to accumulate capital---capital%1:21:00:: so vital for growth---growth%1:22:01:: .
Corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: should pay added taxes---tax%1:21:00:: , to be used for educational purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: ( not necessarily of the formal type---type%1:09:00:: ) .
The right---right%1:07:00:: to leave legacies---legacy%1:21:00:: should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated .
To perpetuate wealth---wealth%1:21:00:: control---control%1:04:00:: led by small groups---group%1:03:00:: of individuals---individual%1:03:00:: who played no role---role%1:04:00:: in its creation---creation%1:04:01:: prevents those with real initiative---initiative%1:07:00:: from coming to the fore , and is basically anti democratic .
When the proprietor---proprietor%1:18:00:: dies , the establishment---establishment%1:14:01:: should become a corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: until it is either acquired by another proprietor---proprietor%1:18:00:: or the government---government%1:14:00:: decides to drop it .
Strikes---strike%1:04:00:: should be declared illegal against corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: because disagreements---disagreement%1:26:00:: would have to be settled by government---government%1:14:00:: representatives---representative%1:18:00:: acting as controllers---controller%1:18:00:: of the corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: whose responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: to the state---state%1:14:01:: would now be defined against proprietorship---proprietorship%1:21:00:: because employees---employee%1:18:00:: and proprietors---proprietor%1:18:00:: must be completely interdependent , as they are each a part---part%1:24:00:: of the whole .
Strikes---strike%1:04:00:: threatening the security---security%1:26:00:: of the proprietorship---proprietorship%1:21:00:: , if internally motivated , prevent a healthy relationship---relationship%1:26:01:: .
Certainly external forces---force%1:07:01:: should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power---power%1:07:00:: available to do so .
If we cannot stop warfare---warfare%1:04:00:: in our own economic system---economic_system%1:14:00:: , how can we expect to abolish it internationally ?
These proposals---proposal%1:10:00:: would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: favoring growth---growth%1:22:01:: of the individual---individual%1:03:00:: , who , in turn , would help us to cope with runaway technology---technology%1:04:00:: .
Individual human strength---strength%1:07:00:: is needed to pit against an inhuman condition---condition%1:26:01:: .
The battle---battle%1:04:01:: is not easy .
We are tempted to blame others for our problems---problem%1:26:00:: rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making---making%1:04:00:: and possible of solution---solution%1:09:00:: only by ourselves with the help---help%1:04:00:: of desperately needed , enlightened , competent leaders---leader%1:18:00:: .
Persons---person%1:03:00:: developed in to-day---today%1:28:00:: 's corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: cannot hope to serve here - a judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: based on experiences---experience%1:11:00:: of my own in business---business%1:04:01:: and in activities---activity%1:04:00:: outside .
In my own company---company%1:14:01:: , in effect a partnership---partnership%1:14:00:: , although legally a corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: , I have been able to do many things---thing%1:04:00:: for my employees---employee%1:18:00:: which `` normal '' corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: of comparable size---size%1:07:00:: and nature---nature%1:07:02:: would have been unable to do .
Also , I am convinced that if my company---company%1:14:01:: were a sole proprietorship---proprietorship%1:21:00:: instead of a partnership---partnership%1:14:00:: , I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems---problem%1:26:00:: for myself and my fellow---fellow%1:18:03:: employees---employee%1:18:00:: .
Any abilities---ability%1:07:00:: I may have were achieved in their present shape---shape%1:09:01:: from experience---experience%1:09:01:: in sharing in the growth---growth%1:22:01:: and control---control%1:07:00:: of my business---business%1:14:00:: , coupled with raising my family---family%1:14:00:: .
This combined experience---experience%1:11:00:: , on a foundation---foundation%1:24:00:: of very average , I assure you , intelligence---intelligence%1:09:00:: and background---background%1:07:00:: , has helped me do things---thing%1:04:00:: many well-informed people---people%1:14:00:: would bet heavily against .
Perhaps a list---list%1:10:00:: of some of the `` practices---practice%1:04:00:: '' of my company---company%1:14:01:: will help here .
The company---company%1:14:01:: grew out of efforts---effort%1:04:00:: by two completely inexperienced men---man%1:18:00:: in their late twenties---twenties%1:28:00:: , neither having a formal education---education%1:04:00:: applicable to , or experience---experience%1:09:01:: in , manufacturing---manufacturing%1:04:00:: or selling---selling%1:04:00:: our type---type%1:09:00:: of articles---article%1:03:00:: .
From an initial investment---investment%1:21:00:: of $ 1200 in 1943 , it has grown , with no additional capital---capital%1:21:01:: investment---investment%1:04:00:: , to a present value---value%1:21:00:: estimated by some as exceeding $ 10000000 ( we do n't disclose financial figures---figure%1:21:00:: to the public---public%1:14:00:: ) .
Its growth---growth%1:22:01:: continues steadily on a par---par%1:26:00:: with past growth---growth%1:22:01:: ; and no limitation---limitation%1:23:00:: is in evidence .
Our pin-curl clips---clip%1:06:01:: and self-locking nuts---nut%1:06:00:: achieved dominance---dominance%1:26:00:: in just a few years---year%1:28:01:: time---time%1:28:00:: , despite substantial , well established competition---competition%1:24:01:: .
The safe---safe%1:06:00:: at Ingleside District Station---group%1:03:00:: stands next to the gum---gum%1:13:00:: machine---machine%1:06:00:: in a narrow passageway---passageway%1:06:00:: that leads to Captain Harris---person%1:03:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: ( to the left---left%1:15:00:: ) , the lieutenant---lieutenant%1:18:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: ( farther along and to the left---left%1:15:00:: ) and the janitor---janitor%1:18:00:: 's supply closet---supply_closet%1:06:00:: ( straight ahead ) .
The safe---safe%1:06:00:: is a repository---repository%1:06:00:: for three dead flashlight batteries---flashlight_battery%1:06:00:: , a hundred and fifty unused left-hand fingerprint---fingerprint%1:10:01:: cards---card%1:10:01:: , a stack---stack%1:14:00:: of unsold Policemen's Ball tickets---ticket%1:10:01:: from last year---year%1:28:01:: , and thirty-seven cents---cent%1:23:00:: in coins---coin%1:21:02:: and stamps---stamp%1:10:01:: .
Gun---person%1:03:00:: set the captain---captain%1:18:04:: 's fifth---fifth%1:23:01:: of Hiram Walker inside the safe---safe%1:06:00:: before he reported to Lt. Killpath---person%1:03:00:: , though he knew that Killpath---person%1:03:00:: 's ulcer---ulcer%1:26:00:: prevented him from making any untoward incursion---incursion%1:04:01:: on Herman Wolff---person%1:03:00:: 's gift---gift%1:21:00:: .
It was more a matter---matter%1:09:00:: of tact---tact%1:07:00:: , and also it was none of Killpath---person%1:03:00:: 's goddam business---business%1:09:01:: .
He walked up to the lieutenant---lieutenant%1:18:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: , leaned wearily against the gun---gun%1:06:00:: rack---rack%1:06:01:: that housed four rifles---rifle%1:06:00:: and a gas gun---gas_gun%1:06:00:: nobody remembered having used and a submachine gun---submachine_gun%1:06:00:: that was occasionally tried out on the Academy Range---group%1:03:00:: .
He stared at the clerk---clerk%1:18:00:: who sat at a scarred and ancient fumed-oak---fumed_oak%1:20:00:: desk---desk%1:06:00:: stuffing envelopes---envelope%1:06:01:: .
`` Where 's the Lieut---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
The clerk---clerk%1:18:00:: wagged his head---head%1:08:00:: toward the captain---captain%1:18:04:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: .
Gun---person%1:03:00:: went to the connecting door---door%1:06:00:: , which was open , and stood at attention---attention%1:07:00:: while Orville Torrence Killpath---person%1:03:00:: , in full uniform---uniform%1:06:00:: , finished combing his hair---hair%1:08:00:: .
The lieutenant---lieutenant%1:18:00:: 's sparse brown hair---hair%1:08:00:: was heavily pomaded , and as Killpath---person%1:03:00:: raked the comb---comb%1:06:00:: through it , it stuck together in thatches---thatch%1:08:00:: so that it looked like umbrella---umbrella%1:06:00:: ribs---rib%1:06:00:: clinging to his pink skull---skull%1:08:00:: .
The lieutenant---lieutenant%1:18:00:: eyed Gun---person%1:03:00:: 's reflection---reflection%1:06:00:: in the mirror---mirror%1:06:00:: over the washbowl---washbowl%1:06:02:: and then glanced back at his own face---face%1:08:00:: , moving the comb---comb%1:06:00:: methodically around his head---head%1:08:00:: .
Leave me alone , Gun---person%1:03:00:: thought .
Fight with Sam Schaeffer---person%1:03:00:: , fight with the whole damned Bureau---group%1:03:00:: .
Because I 'm looking for the son of a bitch---son_of_a_bitch%1:18:00:: that killed that old man---old_man%1:18:02:: , and I 'm going to get him .
If you just leave me to hell alone , Lieutenant---person%1:03:00:: .
Killpath---person%1:03:00:: peered through half closed lids---lid%1:08:00:: at his reflection---reflection%1:06:00:: , thrust up his chin---chin%1:08:00:: in a gesture---gesture%1:10:00:: of satisfaction---satisfaction%1:26:00:: and about-faced .
Gun---person%1:03:00:: waited for Killpath---person%1:03:00:: to sit down behind the desk---desk%1:06:00:: near the window---window%1:06:00:: .
He sat stiff-backed in a chair---chair%1:06:00:: that did not swivel , though it was obvious to Gun---person%1:03:00:: that Killpath---person%1:03:00:: felt his position---position%1:04:01:: as acting captain---captain%1:18:04:: plainly merited a swivel chair---swivel_chair%1:06:00:: .
The desk---desk%1:06:00:: before him was in no better repair---repair%1:26:00:: than the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the furniture---furniture%1:06:00:: crowded into the room---room%1:06:00:: , including wooden file cabinets---file_cabinet%1:06:00:: with some of their pulls---pull%1:06:01:: yanked off and a wardrobe---wardrobe%1:06:00:: stained with the roof---roof%1:06:00:: seepage---seepage%1:11:00:: of countless seasons---season%1:28:00:: .
Killpath---person%1:03:00:: pulled one thin leg---leg%1:08:01:: up , clamping his arms---arm%1:08:00:: around the shinbone---shinbone%1:08:00:: to press his knee---knee%1:08:00:: into an incredibly scrawny gut---gut%1:08:00:: .
It was the posture---posture%1:07:00:: which the men---man%1:18:08:: had come to recognize as that of Killpath---person%1:03:00:: defying his ulcer---ulcer%1:26:00:: .
He put his chin---chin%1:08:00:: on his kneecap---kneecap%1:08:00:: , stretching his neck---neck%1:08:00:: like that of a turkey---turkey%1:05:00:: on a chopping block---chopping_block%1:06:00:: , and stared wordlessly at his sergeant---sergeant%1:18:00:: .
Gun---person%1:03:00:: waited .
The 7 : 45 bell---bell%1:11:00:: rang and he could hear the outside doors---outside_door%1:06:00:: bang shut , closing in the assembled day watch---day_watch%1:14:00:: .
Finally , Orville---person%1:03:00:: intoned through his hawk nose---hawk_nose%1:08:00:: , `` We can n't have people---people%1:14:00:: running in any time---time%1:28:06:: they please , Sergeant---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` No , sir---sir%1:18:00:: '' .
Makes for confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: and congestion---congestion%1:26:01:: '' .
He rocked back in the chair---chair%1:06:00:: , knee---knee%1:08:00:: locked against stomach---stomach%1:08:01:: , his beady eyes---eye%1:08:00:: fixed on Matson---person%1:03:00:: .
He was silent again , possibly listening to the sounds---sound%1:09:00:: in the squadroom .
Roll---roll%1:10:00:: was being called .
Gun---person%1:03:00:: cleared his throat---throat%1:08:00:: .
Killpath---person%1:03:00:: said , `` You were expected to report to my office---office%1:06:00:: twenty minutes---minute%1:28:00:: ago , Sergeant---person%1:03:00:: .
That 's not getting all the juice---juice%1:13:00:: out of the orange---orange%1:13:00:: , now is it '' ?
`` No , sir---sir%1:18:00:: '' .
Then Killpath---person%1:03:00:: smiled .
Gun---person%1:03:00:: knew that nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but aces---ace%1:06:00:: back to back would give the lieutenant---lieutenant%1:18:00:: an ulcer---ulcer%1:26:00:: and a smile---smile%1:10:00:: at the same time .
The day-watch---day_watch%1:14:00:: platoon---platoon%1:14:01:: commander---commander%1:18:03:: , Lt. Rinker---person%1:03:00:: , was calling out the beat---beat%1:15:00:: assignments---assignment%1:04:00:: , but Matson---person%1:03:00:: could n't make the names---name%1:10:00:: mean anything .
`` I called the station---station%1:06:00:: at three this morning---morning%1:28:00:: '' , Killpath---person%1:03:00:: 's nasal voice---voice%1:07:00:: pronounced .
`` Do you have any idea---idea%1:09:02:: who might have been in charge at the time---time%1:28:06:: '' ?
`` Sergeant Vaughn---person%1:03:00:: , sir---sir%1:18:00:: '' .
`` Now , now , you 're just guessing , Sergeant---person%1:03:00:: '' .
He smiled thinly , savoring his joke---joke%1:10:00:: .
`` What if I said nobody was here but a couple of patrolmen---patrolman%1:18:00:: '' ?
`` Sir---sir%1:18:00:: , Vaughn---person%1:03:00:: knows better than to leave the station---station%1:06:00:: without a relief---relief%1:18:00:: .
`` He let a patrolman---patrolman%1:18:00:: take over the duties---duty%1:04:02:: of the station keeper---station_keeper%1:18:00:: .
`` No---no%1:10:00:: , sir---sir%1:18:00:: '' .
Killpath---person%1:03:00:: leaned forward ; his foot---foot%1:08:01:: slipped off the chair---chair%1:06:00:: and he put it back again , frowning now .
`` That 's not taking one 's command---command%1:10:00:: with a responsible attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: , Matson---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Gun---person%1:03:00:: told himself that the old bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: was a fool---fool%1:18:00:: .
But stupidity---stupidity%1:09:00:: was no consolation---consolation%1:12:00:: when it had rank---rank%1:26:01:: .
`` I was out in the district---district%1:15:00:: , sir---sir%1:18:00:: '' .
`` Oh , yes---yes%1:10:00:: .
He stretched a pale hand---hand%1:08:00:: out to the scattered papers---papers%1:10:00:: on his desk---desk%1:06:00:: .
`` I might point out that your inability---inability%1:09:00:: to report to my office---office%1:06:00:: this morning---morning%1:28:00:: when you were instructed to do so has not , ah , limited my knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of your activities---activity%1:04:00:: as you may have hoped '' .
He took up a white sheet of paper---sheet_of_paper%1:10:00:: , dark with single-spaced data---data%1:14:00:: .
A car---car%1:06:00:: pulled into the driveway---driveway%1:06:00:: outside the window---window%1:06:00:: .
Gun---person%1:03:00:: knew it was Car 12 , the wagon---wagon%1:06:02:: , returned from delivering Ingleside---location%1:03:00:: 's drunk-and-disorderlies---drunk-and-disorderly%1:18:00:: to the City Jail---location%1:03:00:: .
But for some fool reason---reason%1:10:01:: he could n't remember which men---man%1:18:08:: he 'd put on the transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: detail---detail%1:14:01:: .
He stared at the report---report%1:10:03:: in Killpath---person%1:03:00:: 's hand---hand%1:08:00:: , sure it was written by Accacia---person%1:03:00:: - just as sure as if he 'd submitted it in his scrawled longhand---longhand%1:10:00:: .
He sucked in his breath---breath%1:27:00:: and kept quiet while Killpath---person%1:03:00:: laid down the sheet---sheet%1:10:00:: again , wound the gold wire---wire%1:06:00:: stems---stem%1:06:02:: of his glasses---glasses%1:06:00:: around his ears---ear%1:08:01:: and then , eying the report---report%1:10:03:: as it lay before him on the desk---desk%1:06:00:: , intoned , `` Acting Lieutenant Gunnar Matson---person%1:03:00:: one failed to see that the station keeper---station_keeper%1:18:00:: was properly relieved two absented himself throughout the entire watch---watch%1:28:01:: without checking on the station---station%1:06:00:: 's activities---activity%1:04:00:: or the whereabouts---whereabouts%1:15:00:: of his section---section%1:14:02:: sergeants---sergeant%1:18:00:: three permitted members---member%1:18:00:: of the Homicide Detail of the Inspector's Bureau---group%1:03:00:: to arrogate for their own convenience---convenience%1:26:00:: a patrolman---patrolman%1:18:00:: who was thereby prevented from carrying on his proper assignment---assignment%1:04:00:: four failed to notify the station---station%1:06:00:: commander---commander%1:18:03:: Acting Captain O.

What have you to say to that , Sergeant---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Killpath---person%1:03:00:: sailed the paper---paper%1:27:00:: across the desk---desk%1:06:00:: , but Matson---person%1:03:00:: did n't pick it up or even glance at it .
`` I did n't think Accacia---person%1:03:00:: knew so many big words---word%1:10:00:: , Lieutenant---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Killpath---person%1:03:00:: licked his lips---lip%1:08:00:: .
`` Patrolman Accacia---person%1:03:00:: is an alert and conscientious law-enforcement---law_enforcement%1:04:00:: officer---officer%1:18:01:: .
I do n't think his diligence---diligence%1:07:01:: mitigates your negligence---negligence%1:04:00:: , Matson---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` Negligence---negligence%1:04:00:: , hell '' !
Gun---person%1:03:00:: held his breath---breath%1:27:00:: a moment---moment%1:28:01:: , pushing the volume---volume%1:07:02:: and pitch---pitch%1:07:00:: of his voice---voice%1:07:00:: down under the trapdoor in his throat---throat%1:08:00:: .
`` Sir---sir%1:18:00:: .
I would have been negligent and a goddam lousy cop---cop%1:18:00:: to boot , if I 'd sat around this station---station%1:06:00:: all night---night%1:28:00:: when somebody got away with murder---murder%1:04:00:: in my district---district%1:15:00:: .
It 's too bad I did n't call you , and it 's too bad I let Schaeffer---person%1:03:00:: use Accacia---person%1:03:00:: when he could have had a boy---boy%1:18:02:: who 'd be glad to learn something of Homicide procedure---procedure%1:04:02:: .
But I 'm not one damned bit---bit%1:23:01:: sorry I went out to question the people---people%1:14:00:: I know in the places---place%1:15:04:: they hang around , and '' -
`` Let 's not push our patience---patience%1:07:00:: beyond the danger line---danger_line%1:15:00:: , Sergeant---person%1:03:00:: '' , Killpath---person%1:03:00:: nasaled .
`` I should n't like to have to write you up for insubordination---insubordination%1:07:00:: as well as dereliction---dereliction%1:07:00:: of duty---duty%1:04:02:: '' .
Gun---person%1:03:00:: stiffened , his hands---hand%1:08:00:: balling into fists---fist%1:08:00:: at his sides---side%1:08:00:: .
He clamped his jaws---jaw%1:08:00:: to keep the fury---fury%1:12:00:: from spilling out .
An argument---argument%1:10:03:: with Orville Torrence Killpath---person%1:03:00:: was as frustrating and as futile as a cap---cap%1:06:05:: pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: on a firing range---firing_range%1:06:00:: .
Killpath---person%1:03:00:: leaned forward again , rocked comfortably with his arms---arm%1:08:00:: still wrapped around one knee---knee%1:08:00:: .
`` Let 's just remember , Sergeant---person%1:03:00:: , that we must all carry our own umbrella .
A district---district%1:15:00:: station---station%1:06:00:: can n't run smoothly , unless '' - He interrupted himself , looking around Gun---person%1:03:00:: at the doorway---doorway%1:06:00:: .
`` Morning---morning%1:10:00:: , Lieutenant Rinker---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` Sorry , Orville---person%1:03:00:: .
`` I 've been here for some time---time%1:28:00:: '' .
He stood up , cocked his head---head%1:08:00:: and eyed Gun---person%1:03:00:: coldly .
`` The sergeant---sergeant%1:18:00:: is just leaving '' .
It had come as no great surprise---surprise%1:11:00:: to Matson---person%1:03:00:: that the hot water---water%1:27:00:: in the showers---shower%1:06:00:: did n't work , that Loren Severe---person%1:03:00:: had thrown up all over the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: , or that some thieving bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: of a cop---cop%1:18:00:: had walked off with his cigarettes---cigarette%1:06:00:: .
It was the best---best%1:04:00:: he could hope for on a watch---watch%1:28:01:: that had ended with a session---session%1:04:00:: in Killpath---person%1:03:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: .
Now , as he passed the open counter---counter%1:06:00:: that divided the assembly---assembly%1:06:01:: room---room%1:06:00:: from the business---business%1:04:01:: office---office%1:06:00:: , he nodded and said good night---good_night%1:10:00:: to the station keeper---station_keeper%1:18:00:: and his clerks---clerk%1:18:00:: , not stopping to hear the day-watch---day_watch%1:14:00:: playback---playback%1:04:00:: of his chewing out---chewing_out%1:10:00:: .
Not that he gave a damn---damn%1:07:00:: what the grapevine---grapevine%1:10:00:: sent out about Killpath---person%1:03:00:: 's little speech---speech%1:10:03:: on the comportment---comportment%1:07:00:: of platoon---platoon%1:14:01:: commanders---commander%1:18:03:: .
If the acting captain---captain%1:18:04:: wanted his acting lieutenant---lieutenant%1:18:00:: to sit on his ass---ass%1:08:00:: around the station---station%1:06:00:: all night---night%1:28:00:: , Killpath---person%1:03:00:: would just have to go out and drag Gun---person%1:03:00:: back by the heels---heel%1:08:00:: once an hour---hour%1:28:00:: ; because he 'd be damned if he was going to be a mid-watch---midwatch%1:28:00:: pencil-pusher---pencil_pusher%1:18:00:: just to please his ulcerated pro-tem captain---captain%1:18:04:: .
At the doorway---doorway%1:06:00:: he squinted up at the gray morning overcast---overcast%1:26:00:: and patted his jacket---jacket%1:06:00:: pockets---pocket%1:06:00:: for the cigarettes---cigarette%1:06:00:: , remembering then that he 'd left them at the Doughnuttery---group%1:03:00:: .
He could pick up another pack---pack%1:06:00:: on his way---way%1:15:00:: home , if he were going home .
But even before he started across the oiled road---road%1:06:00:: to his Plymouth , parked in the lot---lot%1:15:00:: under the cypress trees---cypress_tree%1:20:00:: across from the station---station%1:06:00:: , he knew that he was n't going home .
It was nine---nine%1:23:00:: o ' clock in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: : the hour---hour%1:28:01:: which , like a spade---spade%1:06:00:: turning clods---clod%1:14:00:: of earth---earth%1:27:00:: , exposed to the day---day%1:28:02:: a myriad---myriad%1:23:01:: of busy creatures---creature%1:18:01:: that had lain dormant in the quiet night---night%1:28:00:: .
Mission Street---location%1:03:00:: at this hour---hour%1:28:01:: was populated by a whole community---community%1:14:00:: that Gun---person%1:03:00:: could not have seen on his tour---tour%1:28:00:: of duty---duty%1:04:02:: - the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:14:00:: that had known Urbano Quintana---person%1:03:00:: by day---day%1:28:02:: .
Sol Phillips---person%1:03:00:: had purchased the Alliance Furniture Mart---group%1:03:00:: seventeen years---year%1:28:01:: ago .
It was professedly worth three thousand dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: in stock---stock%1:06:00:: and good will---good_will%1:21:00:: , and the name---name%1:10:00:: was written in gold---gold%1:07:00:: in foot---foot%1:23:00:: high letters---letter%1:10:01:: across each of the two display windows---display_window%1:06:00:: .
On the right window---window%1:06:00:: , at eye---eye%1:08:00:: level---level%1:07:01:: , in smaller print---print%1:10:00:: but also in gold---gold%1:07:00:: , was Gonzalez---person%1:03:00:: , Prop. , and under that , Se Habla Espanol .
Mr. Phillips---person%1:03:00:: took a razor---razor%1:06:00:: to Gonzalez---person%1:03:00:: , Prop. , but left the promise---promise%1:10:00:: that Spanish---spanish%1:10:00:: would be understood because he thought it meant that Spanish---spanish%1:18:00:: clientele---clientele%1:14:00:: would be welcome .
Language---language%1:10:00:: was no problem---problem%1:09:00:: anyway ; Mr. Phillips---person%1:03:00:: had only to signal from his doorway---doorway%1:06:00:: to summon aid---aid%1:04:00:: from the ubiquitous bilingual children---child%1:18:00:: who played on the sidewalks---sidewalk%1:06:00:: of Mission Street---location%1:03:00:: .
Aside from the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that business---business%1:04:02:: was slow this time of year---time_of_year%1:28:00:: and his one salesgirl---salesgirl%1:18:00:: was not the most enterprising , Mr. Phillips---person%1:03:00:: had no worries---worry%1:09:00:: at all , and he said as much to Gun Matson---person%1:03:00:: , who sat across from him in civilian clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: , on a Jiffy-Couch-a-Bed , mauve velour---velour%1:06:00:: , $ 79.89 nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: down special---special%1:10:00:: !
`` She 's honest as the day '' , Mr. Phillips---person%1:03:00:: said , and added , `` Mr. Gunnar---person%1:03:00:: , I can say this to you : Beebe---person%1:03:00:: is a little too honest .
You can n't tell a customer---customer%1:18:00:: how much it 's going to cost him to refinance his payments---payment%1:21:00:: before he even signs for a loan---loan%1:21:00:: on the money---money%1:21:00:: down !
A time plan---time_plan%1:21:00:: is a mere convenience---convenience%1:26:00:: , you understand , and when '' - He interrupted himself , smiling .
`` I put her in lamps---lamp%1:06:01:: .
That way---way%1:07:01:: I do n't lose so much '' .
Early in November---november%1:28:00:: the clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: lifted enough to carry out the assigned missions---mission%1:04:01:: .
And Sweeney Squadron put its first marks---mark%1:10:02:: on the combat---combat%1:04:00:: record---record%1:04:01:: .
Every plane---plane%1:06:01:: that could fly was sent into the air---air%1:15:00:: .
Cricket---person%1:03:00:: took eight ships---ship%1:06:00:: and went south across the Straits---location%1:03:00:: and along the north coast---coast%1:17:00:: of Mindanao---location%1:03:00:: to Cagayan---location%1:03:00:: .
Anything the enemy flew or floated was his target---target%1:18:00:: .
Anything the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: flew or floated was his target---target%1:06:00:: .
Fleischman---person%1:03:00:: with eight was to patrol the Leyte Gulf---location%1:03:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: , with his main task---task%1:04:00:: to get any kamikaze---kamikaze%1:06:00:: before they got to the ships---ship%1:06:00:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: himself took two flights---flight%1:14:00:: , with Todman---person%1:03:00:: leading the second , to patrol and look for targets---target%1:06:00:: of opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: around Ormoc---location%1:03:00:: on the east coast---coast%1:17:00:: of Leyte---location%1:03:00:: .
Greg himself took two flights , with Todman leading the second , to patrol and look for targets---target%1:18:00:: of opportunities around Ormoc on the east coast of Leyte .
Each plane---plane%1:06:01:: carried two five-hundred pound---pound%1:23:09:: bombs---bomb%1:06:00:: .
A weapons carrier---weapons_carrier%1:06:00:: took Greg---person%1:03:00:: , Todman---person%1:03:00:: , Belton---person%1:03:00:: , Banjo Ferguson---person%1:03:00:: , and Walters---person%1:03:00:: and the others the two miles---mile%1:23:01:: from the bivouac---bivouac%1:06:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: to the strip---strip%1:06:02:: .
It was a rough long ride---ride%1:04:00:: through the mud---mud%1:27:00:: and pot holes---pothole%1:17:00:: .
No one had much---much%1:23:00:: to say .
The sky---sky%1:17:00:: glowered down at them .
There was a feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: that this mission---mission%1:04:01:: would be canceled like all the others and that this muddy wet dark world---world%1:09:00:: of combat---combat%1:04:00:: would go on forever .
The truck---truck%1:06:00:: dropped them off at the various revetments---revetment%1:06:01:: spread through the jungle .
Donovan---person%1:03:00:: snatched Greg---person%1:03:00:: 's chute---chute%1:06:01:: from him with a belligerent motion---motion%1:04:00:: and almost ran to the plane---plane%1:06:01:: with it .
His face---face%1:08:00:: was dark as the sky---sky%1:17:00:: above it as he stood on the wing---wing%1:06:00:: and waited for his pilot---pilot%1:18:00:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: climbed into the cockpit---cockpit%1:06:00:: feeling as if he had never been in one before .
But his hands---hand%1:08:00:: and those of Donovan---person%1:03:00:: moved automatically adjusting and arranging in the check-out---checkout%1:04:00:: procedure---procedure%1:04:02:: .
`` I 've got her as neat as I can '' , Donovan---person%1:03:00:: said , as he dropped the straps---strap%1:06:01:: of the Seton harness---harness%1:06:01:: over Greg---person%1:03:00:: 's shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
`` But this goddamn climate---climate%1:26:00:: .
It 's for carabao---carabao%1:05:00:: not airplanes---airplane%1:06:00:: '' .
Do n't you worry , chief '' , Greg---person%1:03:00:: replied , wondering if he himself believed it .
See you '' , Donovan---person%1:03:00:: said as he jumped off the wing---wing%1:06:00:: .
The expression---expression%1:10:00:: was his trade-mark---trademark%1:07:00:: , his open sesame---open_sesame%1:04:00:: to good luck---good_luck%1:26:00:: , and his prayer---prayer%1:10:02:: that pilot---pilot%1:18:00:: and plane---plane%1:06:01:: would always return .
At the prearranged time---time%1:28:03:: , Greg---person%1:03:00:: started the engine---engine%1:06:00:: and taxied out .
From the time---time%1:11:00:: the chocks---chock%1:06:00:: were pulled until the plane---plane%1:06:01:: was out of sight , he knew Donovan---person%1:03:00:: would keep his back---back%1:08:00:: to the strip---strip%1:06:02:: .
He wondered where the superstition---superstition%1:09:00:: had originated that it was bad luck---bad_luck%1:26:00:: for a crew---crew%1:14:01:: chief---chief%1:18:01:: to watch his plane---plane%1:06:01:: take off on a combat mission---combat_mission%1:04:00:: .
Yet long before the scheduled time---time%1:28:03:: for return---return%1:04:00:: , Donovan---person%1:03:00:: would be watching for every speck---speck%1:07:00:: in the sky---sky%1:17:00:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: rumbled down the rough metal taxi strip---taxi_strip%1:06:00:: , and one by one the seven members---member%1:18:00:: of his flight---flight%1:14:00:: fell in behind him .
The dark brown bombs---bomb%1:06:00:: hanging under each wing---wing%1:06:00:: looked large and powerful .
The pilots---pilot%1:18:00:: ' heads---head%1:08:00:: looked ridiculously small .
The control tower---control_tower%1:06:00:: gave him immediate take-off---takeoff%1:04:00:: permission---permission%1:10:00:: , and the clean roar---roar%1:11:00:: of the engine---engine%1:06:00:: that took him off the rough strip---strip%1:06:02:: spoke well of the skill---skill%1:09:00:: of Donovan---person%1:03:00:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: 's mission---mission%1:04:01:: was the last to leave , and as he circled the ships---ship%1:06:00:: off Tacloban---location%1:03:00:: he saw the clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: were dropping down again .
To the west---west%1:24:00:: , the dark green hills of Leyte---location%1:03:00:: were lost in the clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: about halfway up their slopes---slope%1:17:00:: .
Underneath him the sea---sea%1:17:00:: was a dark and muddied gray .
Water---water%1:27:00:: splashed against his windshield---windshield%1:06:00:: as he led the flight---flight%1:14:01:: in and out of showers---shower%1:19:00:: .
The metal strip---strip%1:06:02:: they had taken off from was coal black against the green jungle around it .
He possessed the fighter---fighter%1:06:00:: pilot---pilot%1:18:00:: 's horror---horror%1:12:01:: of bad weather---bad_weather%1:26:00:: and instrument flying---instrument_flying%1:04:00:: , and he wondered , if the ceiling---ceiling%1:07:00:: did drop , whether he and the other flights---flight%1:14:00:: would be able to find their way---way%1:06:00:: back in this unfamiliar territory---territory%1:15:00:: .
He shivered in the warm cockpit---cockpit%1:06:00:: .
The overcast---overcast%1:26:00:: was solid above him .
As far as he could see there was no hole---hole%1:17:01:: to climb through it .
They would have to go west through the narrow river---river%1:17:00:: valley---valley%1:17:00:: that separated Leyte---location%1:03:00:: from Samar---location%1:03:00:: and hope that it did n't close in before they returned .
Greg---location%1:03:00:: pushed the radio---radio%1:06:00:: button---button%1:06:01:: on his throttle---throttle%1:06:00:: .
`` Todman---person%1:03:00:: , let 's try to go under this stuff---stuff%1:27:00:: .
Stay in close and we 'll go up the valley---valley%1:17:00:: '' .
`` Roger , Sweeney---person%1:03:00:: '' , Todman---person%1:03:00:: called back , and pulled his four---four%1:23:00:: in and slightly above Greg---person%1:03:00:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: took the formation---formation%1:14:00:: wide around three A-26 attack bombers---bomber%1:06:00:: that were headed north over the Gulf---location%1:03:00:: .
He dropped down to five hundred feet---foot%1:23:00:: , swinging a little north of the city---city%1:15:00:: of Tacloban---location%1:03:00:: , and punched into the opening---opening%1:17:00:: that showed against the mountain---mountain%1:17:00:: .
The valley---valley%1:17:00:: was only a few hundred yards---yard%1:23:00:: wide with just about room---room%1:23:00:: enough for a properly performed hundred-and-eighty degree---degree%1:23:00:: turn---turn%1:04:02:: .
It was only a fifteen minute---minute%1:28:00:: flight---flight%1:04:00:: , but before it was through Greg---person%1:03:00:: felt himself developing a case---case%1:11:00:: of claustrophobia---claustrophobia%1:26:00:: .
The ceiling---ceiling%1:07:00:: stayed solid above them at about eight hundred feet---foot%1:23:00:: , and at times the sheer cliffs---cliff%1:17:00:: seemed about to close in .
If the other pilots---pilot%1:18:00:: were worried , they did not show it .
The formation---formation%1:14:00:: remained perfect .
When the sea---sea%1:17:00:: was visible ahead of them , the relief---relief%1:12:00:: was as great as if the sun---sun%1:17:00:: had come out .
He spread the flight---flight%1:14:01:: out and led them across a point---point%1:17:02:: of land---land%1:17:00:: and then down the coast---coast%1:17:00:: .
Although they drew light ground---ground%1:17:00:: fire---fire%1:04:00:: they saw no signs---sign%1:10:05:: of activity---activity%1:26:00:: .
Once Todman---person%1:03:00:: thought he had spotted a tank---tank%1:06:01:: and went down to investigate while Greg---person%1:03:00:: covered him .
Todman---person%1:03:00:: said over the radio---radio%1:06:00:: as he came back up in formation---formation%1:14:00:: .
Visibility---visibility%1:07:00:: continued to be limited , and Greg---person%1:03:00:: was never able to get above a thousand feet---foot%1:23:00:: .
His earphones---earphone%1:06:00:: were constantly full of the sounds---sound%1:07:00:: of enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: contacts---contact%1:04:02:: made by other flights---flight%1:14:01:: .
He thought once that he identified the somewhat hysterical voice---voice%1:07:00:: of Fleischman---person%1:03:00:: claiming a kill---kill%1:04:01:: .
But Greg---person%1:03:00:: 's area---area%1:15:01:: remained as placid as a Florida---florida%1:15:00:: dawn---dawn%1:11:01:: .
Finally , as time---time%1:28:05:: began to run out , he headed into Ormoc---location%1:03:00:: and glide-bombed a group---group%1:03:00:: of houses---house%1:06:00:: that Intelligence---intelligence%1:14:00:: had thought might contain Japanese supplies .
The low clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: made bombing---bombing%1:04:00:: difficult .
There was not enough room---room%1:23:00:: to make the usual vertical bomb---bomb%1:06:00:: run---run%1:04:04:: .
The accuracy---accuracy%1:07:02:: was deplorable .
One of Greg---person%1:03:00:: 's bombs---bomb%1:06:00:: hung up , and he was miles---mile%1:23:01:: from the target---target%1:15:00:: before he could get rid of it .
Only one of the flight---flight%1:14:01:: scored a direct hit---hit%1:04:00:: and the rest---rest%1:24:00:: blew up jungle .
With their load---load%1:06:00:: of bombs---bomb%1:06:00:: gone , the planes---plane%1:06:01:: moved swiftly and easily .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: went up tight against the ceiling---ceiling%1:07:00:: and led them back to their pass---pass%1:17:00:: to home---home%1:15:05:: .
Like a man---man%1:18:00:: making a deep dive---dive%1:04:01:: , Greg---person%1:03:00:: took full breath and plunged back into the valley---valley%1:17:00:: .
He was about to make a gas---gas%1:27:02:: check---check%1:04:05:: on his flight---flight%1:14:01:: when Todman---person%1:03:00:: 's voice---voice%1:07:00:: broke in : `` Sweeneys---person%1:03:00:: !
Three bogies---bogy%1:06:00:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: 's eyes---eye%1:08:00:: flicked up from his instrument panel---instrument_panel%1:06:00:: .
He saw them , specks---speck%1:07:00:: against the gray---gray%1:07:00:: , but closing fast .
They were headed straight for each other on a collision---collision%1:11:01:: course---course%1:17:00:: .
Friend---friend%1:18:03:: or enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: ?
The same old question---question%1:10:01:: .
And only a few seconds---second%1:28:00:: to answer it .
Todman---person%1:03:00:: said excitedly , and hopefully .
And then he thought Todman---person%1:03:00:: might be right .
His mind---mind%1:09:00:: flicked through the mental pictures---mental_picture%1:09:00:: he had from the hours---hours%1:28:01:: of Aircraft Identification .
He narrowed the shape---shape%1:07:00:: down to two : either a Zero or a U. S. Navy---group%1:03:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: .
If it were the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: , tactically his position---position%1:15:02:: was correct .
Japanese aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: were strong on maneuverability---maneuverability%1:07:00:: , American on speed---speed%1:28:00:: and firepower---firepower%1:07:00:: .
His present maximum altitude---altitude%1:07:00:: , up against the overcast---overcast%1:26:00:: , gave him the opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to exploit his advantages---advantage%1:07:00:: .
But it also made him conspicuous to the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: , if it was the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: , and he had n't been spotted already .
But the closing aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: showed no sign---sign%1:10:05:: of deviating from their original course---course%1:17:00:: .
In seconds---second%1:28:01:: , Greg---person%1:03:00:: made his decision---decision%1:04:00:: .
He pushed the radio---radio%1:06:00:: button---button%1:06:01:: .
`` Sweeney Blue---person%1:03:00:: , hit the deck .
Lots---lots%1:23:00:: of throttle---throttle%1:06:00:: .
Todman---person%1:03:00:: , you take the one on the left .
Belton---person%1:03:00:: , the one on the right .
If & & & if they 're Japs---jap%1:18:00:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: had the stick---stick%1:06:03:: forward and the throttle---throttle%1:06:00:: up before he heard the two `` Rogers '' .
The planes---plane%1:06:01:: , light with most of the gas---gas%1:27:02:: burned out , responded beautifully .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: 's airspeed---airspeed%1:28:00:: indicator---indicator%1:06:00:: was over 350 when he leveled off just above the trees---tree%1:20:00:: .
The opposing aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: continued to come on .
They appeared to be the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: wished the Air Corps---air_corps%1:14:00:: had continued to camouflage planes---plane%1:06:01:: .
There was , of course , no way---way%1:04:01:: for the other planes---plane%1:06:01:: to get by them .
But they could turn and escape to the east---east%1:24:00:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: pushed the radio---radio%1:06:00:: button---button%1:06:01:: again .
`` Todman---person%1:03:00:: , drop your second element---element%1:06:00:: back .
Now let 's make sure they 're Japs---jap%1:18:00:: '' .
Even as he said it , Greg---person%1:03:00:: knew they had found the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: .
The shapes---shape%1:07:00:: were unmistakable and the Rising Suns---sun%1:17:00:: were showing up , slightly brighter pinpoints---pinpoint%1:07:00:: in the gray gloom---gloom%1:26:01:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: slapped his hand---hand%1:08:00:: across the switches---switch%1:06:01:: that turned on the guns---gun%1:06:00:: and gun---gun%1:06:00:: camera---camera%1:06:00:: and gun---gun%1:06:00:: sight .
The circle---circle%1:25:00:: with the dot---dot%1:25:00:: in the center---center%1:15:01:: showed up yellow on the reflector---reflector%1:06:01:: glass---glass%1:06:03:: in front of him .
His hands---hand%1:08:00:: shook .
`` Arm your guns---gun%1:06:00:: , Sweeneys---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` They 're Japs---jap%1:18:00:: .
They 're Japs---jap%1:18:00:: '' , came a high-pitched voice---voice%1:10:00:: .
`` Greg---person%1:03:00:: to Sweeney Blue---person%1:03:00:: .
One pass---pass%1:04:06:: only .
You 'll bust your ass in this canyon---canyon%1:17:00:: .
That 's an order---order%1:10:03:: '' .
He moved the flights---flight%1:14:01:: over against one wall---wall%1:17:00:: .
It gave them all a chance---chance%1:26:00:: to make a high-speed climbing turn---turn%1:04:01:: attack---attack%1:04:00:: and a break-away---breakaway%1:04:00:: that would not take them into the overcast---overcast%1:26:00:: or force a tight turn---turn%1:04:01:: recovery---recovery%1:11:00:: .
If the turn---turn%1:04:01:: was too tight , a barrel roll---barrel_roll%1:04:00:: would bring them out .
A hell of an altitude---altitude%1:07:00:: for a barrel roll---barrel_roll%1:04:00:: , but it could be done .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: slammed his throttle---throttle%1:06:00:: to the fire wall---firewall%1:04:00:: and rammed up the RPM---rpm%1:28:00:: , and the engine---engine%1:06:00:: responded as if it had been waiting .
The clearly identifiable enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: continued on as if no one else were around .
`` They have n't seen us '' , Greg---person%1:03:00:: yelled to himself over the engine---engine%1:06:00:: noise---noise%1:11:00:: .
He hit the radio---radio%1:06:00:: button---button%1:06:01:: .
`` Now , Sweeneys---person%1:03:00:: , now .
Let 's take ' em home---home%1:15:05:: '' .
He hauled back on the stick---stick%1:06:03:: and felt his cheeks---cheek%1:08:00:: sag .
Out of the corner---corner%1:25:00:: of his eye---eye%1:08:00:: , he watched his wingman---wingman%1:18:00:: move out a bit and shoot up with him .
With the rapid rate---rate%1:28:00:: of closure---closure%1:04:02:: , the approach---approach%1:04:00:: from below , the side---side%1:15:02:: , and ahead , there would be only a moment---moment%1:28:00:: when damage---damage%1:11:01:: could be done .
Just like shooting at a duck---duck%1:05:00:: while performing a half-gainer---half_gainer%1:04:00:: from a diving board---diving_board%1:06:00:: .
He tightened his turn---turn%1:04:01:: .
His nose---nose%1:06:00:: up .
Eight aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: in this small box---box%1:06:00:: .
Please , dear God---god%1:18:00:: , make my pilots---pilot%1:18:00:: good , he prayed .
He took a lead---lead%1:25:00:: on the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: , using a distance---distance%1:07:00:: of five of the radii---radius%1:25:00:: in his circular sight and then added another .
The enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: did not veer .
Blind fools---fool%1:18:01:: .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: 's fingers---finger%1:08:00:: closed on the stick---stick%1:06:03:: trigger---trigger%1:06:00:: .
The plane---plane%1:06:01:: rumbled and slowed .
Six red lines---line%1:25:00:: etched their way---way%1:06:00:: into the gray---gray%1:07:00:: and vanished .
As if drawn by a wire---wire%1:06:00:: the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: flew into them .
Greg---person%1:03:00:: tightened his turn---turn%1:04:01:: until the plane---plane%1:06:01:: shuddered .
Luck---luck%1:19:01:: was with him .
His burst---burst%1:04:01:: held for a second---second%1:28:01:: on the engine---engine%1:06:00:: section---section%1:06:00:: of the plane---plane%1:06:01:: .
The Jap---jap%1:18:00:: 's propeller---propeller%1:06:00:: flew off in pieces---piece%1:06:00:: .
A large piece---piece%1:06:00:: of engine---engine%1:06:00:: cowling---cowling%1:06:00:: vanished .
It was all Greg---person%1:03:00:: had time---time%1:28:05:: to see .
His maneuvering for the shot---shot%1:04:00:: had placed him near the overcast---overcast%1:26:00:: , almost inverted and heading up into the clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: .
His speed---speed%1:28:00:: was dropping rapidly .
If he spun out now , he would join his opponent on the ground---ground%1:17:00:: .
Wingman---wingman%1:18:00:: , stay clear , he prayed .
He pushed stick---stick%1:06:03:: and rudder---rudder%1:06:01:: and entered the overcast---overcast%1:26:00:: on his back---back%1:15:02:: .
He fought the panic---panic%1:12:00:: of vertigo---vertigo%1:26:00:: .
He had no idea---idea%1:09:01:: which was up and which was down .
He held the controls---control%1:06:00:: where they had been .
Sweat---sweat%1:08:00:: popped out over him and he felt the slick---slick%1:07:00:: between his palm---palm%1:08:00:: and the stick---stick%1:06:03:: grip---grip%1:06:01:: .
His air speed---airspeed%1:28:00:: dropped until he thought he would spin out .
There are more stems---stem%1:10:01:: per item---item%1:24:00:: in Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: , which expresses the fact---fact%1:09:02:: that the Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: languages---language%1:10:00:: have undergone somewhat more change---change%1:24:00:: in diverging from proto Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: than the Yokuts---yokuts%1:10:00:: languages---language%1:10:00:: from proto Yokuts---yokuts%1:10:00:: .
This may be because the Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: divergence---divergence%1:04:00:: began earlier ; or again because the Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: languages---language%1:10:00:: spread over a very much larger territory---territory%1:15:00:: ( including three wholly separated areas---area%1:15:01:: ) ; or both .
The differentiation---differentiation%1:09:00:: however is not very much greater , as shown by the fact---fact%1:09:02:: that Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: shows 3.46 stems---stem%1:10:01:: per meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: slot---slot%1:10:00:: as against 2.75 for Yokuts---yokuts%1:10:00:: , with a slightly greater number---number%1:07:00:: of languages---language%1:10:00:: represented in our sample---sample%1:09:00:: : 24---24%1:23:00:: as against 21---21%1:23:00:: .
( On deduction---deduction%1:04:00:: of one-eighth---one-eighth%1:23:00:: from 3.46 , the stem---stem%1:10:01:: / item---item%1:24:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: becomes 3.03 against 2.75 in equivalent number---number%1:07:00:: of languages---language%1:10:00:: . )
These general facts---fact%1:09:02:: are mentioned to make clear that the total situation---situation%1:26:00:: in the two families---family%1:14:04:: is similar enough to warrant comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: .
The greatest difference---difference%1:07:00:: in the two sets---set%1:14:02:: of figures---figure%1:23:00:: is due to differences---difference%1:07:00:: in the two sets---set%1:14:00:: of lists---list%1:10:00:: used .
These differences---difference%1:07:00:: in turn result from the fact---fact%1:26:01:: that my Yokuts---yokuts%1:10:00:: vocabularies---vocabulary%1:10:00:: were built up of terms---term%1:10:00:: selected mainly to insure unambiguity---unambiguity%1:07:00:: of English---english%1:10:00:: meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: between illiterate informants---informant%1:18:00:: and myself , within a compact and uniform territorial area---area%1:15:01:: , but that Hoijer---person%1:03:00:: 's vocabulary---vocabulary%1:10:00:: is based on Swadesh---person%1:03:00:: 's second glottochronological list---list%1:10:00:: which aims at eliminating all items---item%1:24:00:: which might be culturally or geographically determined .
Swadesh---person%1:03:00:: in short was trying to develop a basic list---list%1:10:00:: that was universal ; I , one that was specifically adapted to the San Joaquin Valley---location%1:03:00:: .
The result---result%1:19:00:: is that I included 70 animal---animal%1:03:00:: names---name%1:10:00:: , but Swadesh---person%1:03:00:: only 4---4%1:23:00:: ; and somewhat similarly for plants---plant%1:03:00:: , 16---16%1:23:00:: as against 4---4%1:23:00:: .
Swadesh---person%1:03:00:: , and therefore Hoijer---person%1:03:00:: , felt compelled to omit all terms---term%1:10:00:: denoting species---species%1:14:00:: or even genera---genus%1:14:00:: ( fox---fox%1:05:00:: , vulture---vulture%1:05:00:: , salmon---salmon%1:05:00:: , yellow pine---yellow_pine%1:20:00:: , manzanita---manzanita%1:20:01:: ) ; their classes---class%1:14:00:: of animal---animal%1:03:00:: and plant---plant%1:03:00:: terms---term%1:10:00:: are restricted to generalizations---generalization%1:09:00:: or recurrent parts---part%1:24:00:: ( fish---fish%1:05:00:: , bird---bird%1:05:00:: , tree---tree%1:20:00:: , grass---grass%1:20:00:: , horn---horn%1:05:01:: , tail---tail%1:05:00:: , bark---bark%1:20:00:: , root---root%1:20:00:: ) .
Swadesh , and therefore Hoijer , felt compelled to omit all terms denoting species or even genera ( fox , vulture , salmon , yellow pine , manzanita---manzanita%1:20:02:: ) ; their classes of animal and plant terms are restricted to generalizations or recurrent parts ( fish , bird , tree , grass , horn , tail , bark , root ) .
The groups---group%1:03:00:: are therefore really non comparable in content---content%1:10:00:: as well as in size---size%1:07:00:: .
Other classes---class%1:14:00:: are included only by myself ( interrogatives---interrogative%1:10:00:: , adverbs---adverb%1:10:01:: ) or only by Swadesh---person%1:03:00:: and Hoijer---person%1:03:00:: ( pronouns---pronoun%1:10:00:: , demonstratives---demonstrative%1:10:00:: ) .
What we have left as reasonably comparable are four classes---class%1:14:00:: : ( 1 ) body parts---body_part%1:08:00:: and products---product%1:06:00:: , which with a proportionally nearly even representation---representation%1:09:00:: ( 51 terms---term%1:10:00:: out of 253 , 25---25%1:23:00:: out of 100---100%1:23:00:: ) come out with nearly even ratios---ratio%1:24:01:: ; 2.6 and 2.7 ; ( 2 ) Nature---nature%1:17:00:: ( 29---29%1:23:00:: terms---term%1:10:00:: against 17---17%1:23:00:: ) , ratios---ratio%1:24:01:: 3.3 versus 4.1 ; ( 3 ) adjectives---adjective%1:10:01:: ( 16---16%1:23:00:: , 15---15%1:23:00:: terms---term%1:10:00:: ) , ratios---ratio%1:24:01:: 3.9 versus 4.7 ; ( 4 ) verbs---verb%1:10:00:: ( 9---9%1:23:00:: , 22---22%1:23:00:: terms---term%1:10:00:: ) , ratios---ratio%1:24:01:: 4.0 versus 3.4 .
It will be seen that where the scope---scope%1:07:00:: is similar , the Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: ratios---ratio%1:24:01:: come out somewhat higher ( as indeed they ought to with a total ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: of 2.8 as against 3.5 or 4---4%1:23:00:: : 5---5%1:23:00:: ) except for verbs---verb%1:10:00:: , where alone the Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: is lower .
This exception---exception%1:09:01:: may be connected with Hoijer---person%1:03:00:: 's use---use%1:04:01:: of a much higher percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of verbs---verb%1:10:00:: :
22---22%1:23:00:: % of his total list---list%1:10:00:: as against 3.5 % in mine .
Or the exception---exception%1:09:01:: may be due to a particular durability---durability%1:07:00:: peculiar to the Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: verb---verb%1:10:00:: .
More word class---word_class%1:10:00:: ratios---ratio%1:24:01:: determined in more languages---language%1:10:00:: will no doubt ultimately answer the question---question%1:10:01:: .
If word classes---word_class%1:10:00:: differ in their resistance---resistance%1:04:02:: or liability---liability%1:26:01:: to stem---stem%1:10:01:: replacement---replacement%1:09:00:: within meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: slot---slot%1:10:00:: , it is conceivable that individual meanings---meaning%1:09:00:: also differ with fair consistence---consistence%1:07:02:: trans lingually .
Hoijer---person%1:03:00:: 's Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: and my Yokuts---yokuts%1:10:00:: share 71 identical meanings---meaning%1:09:00:: ( with allowance---allowance%1:07:00:: for several near synonyms---synonym%1:10:00:: like stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: belly---belly%1:08:00:: , big large , long far , many much , die dead---dead%1:14:00:: , say speak ) .
For Yokuts---yokuts%1:10:00:: , I tabulated these 71 items---item%1:24:00:: in five columns---column%1:14:01:: , according as they were expressed by 1---1%1:23:00:: , 2---2%1:23:00:: , 3---3%1:23:00:: , 4---4%1:23:00:: , and more than 4---4%1:23:00:: stems---stem%1:10:01:: .
The totals---total%1:09:00:: for these five categories---category%1:14:00:: are not too uneven , namely 20---20%1:23:00:: , 15---15%1:23:00:: , 11---11%1:23:00:: , 16---16%1:23:00:: , 9---9%1:23:00:: respectively .
For Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: , with a greater range---range%1:07:00:: of stems---stem%1:10:01:: , the first two---two%1:23:00:: of five corresponding columns---column%1:14:01:: were identical , 1 and 2 stems---stem%1:10:01:: ; the three others had to be spread somewhat , and are headed respectively * * f ; * * f ; and * * f stems---stem%1:10:01:: .
While the particular limits---limit%1:07:00:: of these groupings---grouping%1:03:00:: may seem artificially arbitrary ; they do fairly express a corresponding grouping---grouping%1:03:00:: of more variable material---material%1:10:00:: , and they eventuate also in five classes---class%1:14:00:: , along a similar scale---scale%1:24:03:: , containing approximately equal numbers---number%1:07:00:: of cases---case%1:10:00:: , namely 19---19%1:23:00:: , 14---14%1:23:00:: , 15---15%1:23:00:: , 11---11%1:23:00:: , 12---12%1:23:00:: in Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: .
When now we count the frequency---frequency%1:23:00:: of the 71 items---item%1:24:00:: in the two language---language%1:10:00:: families---family%1:14:04:: appearing in the same column---column%1:14:01:: or grade---grade%1:26:00:: , or one column---column%1:14:01:: or grade---grade%1:26:00:: apart , or two---two%1:23:00:: or three---three%1:23:00:: or four---four%1:23:00:: , we find these differences---difference%1:07:00:: : * * f This distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: can be summarized by averaging the distance---distance%1:07:00:: in grades---grade%1:26:00:: apart : * * f ; which , divided by * * f gives a mean---mean%1:09:00:: of 1.07 grades---grade%1:14:00:: apart .
If the distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: of the 71 items---item%1:24:00:: were wholly concordant in the two families---family%1:14:04:: , the distance---distance%1:07:00:: would of course be 0---0%1:23:00:: .
If it were wholly random and unrelated , it would be 2.0---20%1:23:00:: , assuming the five classes---class%1:14:00:: were equal in n , which approximately they are .
The actual mean---mean%1:09:00:: of 1.07 being about halfway between 0---0%1:23:00:: of complete correlation---correlation%1:24:00:: and 2.0---20%1:23:00:: of no correlation---correlation%1:24:00:: , it is evident that there is a pretty fair degree---degree%1:26:01:: of similarity---similarity%1:07:00:: in the behavior---behavior%1:26:00:: even of particular individual items---item%1:24:00:: of meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: as regards long-term stem---stem%1:10:01:: displacement---displacement%1:11:00:: .
In 1960 , David D. Thomas---person%1:03:00:: published Basic Vocabulary---vocabulary%1:10:00:: in some Mon Khmer---mon-khmer%1:10:00:: Languages---language%1:10:00:: AL 2---2%1:23:00:: , no.---no.%1:23:00:: 3---3%1:23:00:: , pp. 7---7%1:23:00:: - 11---11%1:23:00:: ) , which compares 8 Mon-Khmer---mon-khmer%1:10:00:: languages---language%1:10:00:: with the I-E language---language%1:10:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: on which Swadesh---person%1:03:00:: based the revised retention---retention%1:04:00:: rate---rate%1:07:00:: ( * * f ) in place of original---original%1:09:00:: ( * * f ) , and his revised 100---100%1:23:00:: word---word%1:10:00:: basic glottochronological list---list%1:10:00:: in Towards Greater Accuracy ( IJAL 21 : 121 - 137 ) .
Thomas---person%1:03:00:: ' findings---finding%1:04:00:: are , first , `` that the individual items---item%1:24:00:: vary greatly and unpredictably in their persistence---persistence%1:07:02:: '' ; but , second , `` that the semantic groups---group%1:03:00:: are surprisingly unvarying in their average persistence---persistence%1:07:02:: '' ( as between M-K and I-E .
His first conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: , on behavior---behavior%1:26:00:: of individual items---item%1:24:00:: , is negative , whereas mine ( on Ath. and Yok . ) was partially positive .
His second conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: , on semantic word classes---word_class%1:10:00:: , agrees with mine .
This second conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: , independently arrived at by independent study---study%1:04:00:: of material---material%1:10:00:: from two pairs---pair%1:23:00:: of language---language%1:10:00:: families---family%1:14:04:: as different and remote from one another as these four are , cannot be ignored .
Thomas---person%1:03:00:: also presents a simple equation---equation%1:10:00:: for deriving an index---index%1:10:01:: of persistence---persistence%1:07:02:: , which weights not only the number---number%1:07:00:: of stems---stem%1:10:01:: ( ' roots---root%1:10:00:: ' ) per meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: , but their relative frequency---relative_frequency%1:24:00:: .
Thus his persistence---persistence%1:07:02:: values---value%1:09:00:: for some stem---stem%1:10:01:: frequencies---frequency%1:24:00:: per meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: is : stem---stem%1:10:01:: identical in 8 languages---language%1:10:00:: , 100---100%1:23:00:: % ; stem---stem%1:10:01:: frequencies---frequency%1:24:00:: 7 and 1 , 86 % ; stem---stem%1:10:01:: frequencies---frequency%1:24:00:: 4 and 4 , 64 % ; stem---stem%1:10:01:: frequencies---frequency%1:24:00:: 4 , 3 , and 1 , 57 % .
His formula---formula%1:10:00:: will have to be weighed , may be altered or improved , and it should be tested on additional bodies---body%1:14:02:: of material---material%1:10:00:: .
But consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: of the frequency---frequency%1:24:00:: of stems---stem%1:10:01:: per constant---constant%1:09:00:: meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: seems to be established as having significance---significance%1:07:00:: in comparative situations---situation%1:26:00:: with diachronic and classificatory relevance---relevance%1:24:00:: ; and Gleason---person%1:03:00:: presumably is on the way with a further contribution---contribution%1:04:02:: in this area---area%1:09:00:: .
As to relative frequencies---relative_frequency%1:24:00:: of competing roots---root%1:10:00:: ( 7 - 1 vs. 4 - 4 , etc . ) , Thomas---person%1:03:00:: with his ' weighting---weighting%1:23:00:: ' seems to be the first---first%1:24:00:: to have considered the significance---significance%1:09:01:: this might have .
The problem---problem%1:10:00:: needs further exploration---exploration%1:09:00:: .
I was at least conscious of the distinction---distinction%1:07:00:: in my full Yokuts---yokuts%1:10:00:: presentation---presentation%1:10:01:: that awaits publication---publication%1:04:01:: , in which , in listing ' Two Stem Meanings ' , I set off by asterisks---asterisk%1:10:00:: those forms---form%1:10:00:: in which n of stem---stem%1:10:01:: B was * * f of stem---stem%1:10:01:: A 3 , the unasterisked ones standing for * * f ; or under ' Four Stems ' , I set off by asterisks---asterisk%1:10:00:: cases---case%1:11:00:: where the combined n of stems---stem%1:10:01:: * * f was * * f .
These findings---finding%1:04:00:: , and others which will in time be developed , will affect the method---method%1:09:00:: of glottochronological inquiry---inquiry%1:09:01:: .
If adjectival meanings---meaning%1:09:00:: show relatively low retentiveness---retentiveness%1:09:00:: of stems---stem%1:10:01:: , as I am confident will prove to be the case---case%1:26:00:: in most languages---language%1:10:00:: of the world , why should our basic lists---list%1:10:00:: include 15 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of these unstable forms---form%1:10:00:: , but only 8 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of animals---animal%1:03:00:: and plants---plant%1:03:00:: which replace much more slowly ?
Had Hoijer---person%1:03:00:: substituted for his 15 adjectival slots---slot%1:10:00:: 15 good animal---animal%1:03:00:: and plant---plant%1:03:00:: items---item%1:24:00:: , his rate---rate%1:28:00:: of stem---stem%1:10:01:: replacement---replacement%1:11:00:: would have been lower and the age---age%1:07:00:: of Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: language---language%1:10:00:: separation---separation%1:11:00:: smaller .
And irrespective of the outcome---outcome%1:11:00:: in centuries---century%1:28:00:: elapsed since splitting , calculations---calculation%1:04:00:: obviously carry more concordant and comparable meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: if they deal with the most stable units---unit%1:09:00:: than with variously unstable ones .
It is evident that Swadesh---person%1:03:00:: has not only had much experience---experience%1:09:01:: with basic vocabulary---vocabulary%1:10:00:: in many languages---language%1:10:00:: but has acquired great tact---tact%1:07:00:: and feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: for the expectable behavior---behavior%1:26:00:: of lexical items---item%1:24:00:: .
Why then this urge---urge%1:12:00:: to include unstable items---item%1:24:00:: in his basic list---list%1:10:00:: ?
It is the urge---urge%1:12:00:: to obtain a list---list%1:10:00:: as free of geographical and cultural conditioning---conditioning%1:09:00:: as possible .
And why that insistence---insistence%1:10:00:: ?
It is the hope---hope%1:09:00:: of attaining a list---list%1:10:00:: of items---item%1:24:00:: of universal occurrence---occurrence%1:26:00:: .
But it is becoming increasingly evident that such a hope---hope%1:09:00:: is a snare---snare%1:09:00:: .
Not that such a list---list%1:10:00:: cannot be constructed ; but the nearer it comes to attaining universality---universality%1:07:00:: , the less significant will it be linguistically .
Its terms---term%1:10:00:: will tend to be labile or vague , and they will fit actual languages---language%1:10:00:: more and more badly .
The practical operational problem---problem%1:10:00:: of lexicostatistics---lexicostatistics%1:09:00:: is the establishment---establishment%1:04:00:: of a basic list---list%1:10:00:: of items---item%1:24:00:: of meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: against which the particular forms---form%1:10:00:: or terms---term%1:10:00:: of languages---language%1:10:00:: can be matched as the medium---medium%1:10:01:: of comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: .
The most important quality---quality%1:09:00:: of the meanings---meaning%1:09:00:: is that they should be as definable as possible .
In proportion---proportion%1:07:00:: as meanings---meaning%1:09:00:: are concrete , we can better rely on their being insulated and distinctive .
An elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana---banana%1:13:00:: possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious , common-sense , indubitable identity , as do an eye or tooth---tooth%1:05:02:: or nail .
An elephant---elephant%1:05:00:: or a fox---fox%1:05:00:: or a swan---swan%1:05:00:: or a cocopalm---coco_palm%1:20:00:: or a banana---banana%1:20:00:: possess in unusually high degree---degree%1:07:00:: this quality---quality%1:09:00:: of obvious , common-sense , indubitable identity---identity%1:09:00:: , as do an eye---eye%1:08:00:: or tooth---tooth%1:08:00:: or nail---nail%1:08:00:: .
They isolate out easily , naturally , and unambiguously from the continuum---continuum%1:28:00:: of nature---nature%1:18:00:: and existence---existence%1:26:00:: ; and they should be given priority---priority%1:26:00:: in the basic list---list%1:10:00:: as long as they continue to show these qualities---quality%1:09:00:: .
With the universal list---list%1:10:00:: as his weapon---weapon%1:10:00:: , Swadesh---person%1:03:00:: has extended his march---march%1:04:02:: of conquest---conquest%1:04:00:: farther and farther into the past---past%1:28:00:: , eight , ten , twelve millennia---millennium%1:28:00:: back .
And he has proclaimed greater or less affiliation---affiliation%1:04:00:: between all Western hemisphere---western_hemisphere%1:15:00:: languages---language%1:10:00:: .
Some of this may prove to be true , or even considerable of it , whether by genetic ramification---ramification%1:04:00:: or by diffusion---diffusion%1:11:00:: and coalescence---coalescence%1:04:00:: .
But the farther out he moves , the thinner will be his hold---hold%1:04:00:: on conclusive evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: , and the larger the speculative component---component%1:09:00:: in his inferences---inference%1:09:00:: .
He has traversed provinces---province%1:15:00:: and kingdoms---kingdom%1:15:01:: , but he has not consolidated them behind him , nor does he control them .
He has announced results---result%1:10:00:: on Hokan---hokan%1:10:00:: , Penutian---penutian%1:10:00:: , Uto-Aztecan---uto-aztecan%1:10:00:: , and almost all other American families---family%1:14:04:: and phyla---phylum%1:14:01:: , and has diagrammed their degree---degree%1:26:01:: of interrelation---interrelation%1:24:00:: ; but he has not worked out by lexicostatistics---lexicostatistics%1:09:00:: one comprehensively complete classification---classification%1:14:00:: of even a single family---family%1:14:04:: other than Salish---salish%1:10:00:: .
That is his privilege---privilege%1:07:00:: .
The remote , cloudy , possible---possible%1:09:00:: has values---value%1:07:00:: of its own - values---value%1:07:00:: of scope---scope%1:07:00:: , stimulus---stimulus%1:09:00:: , potential---potential%1:26:00:: , and imagination---imagination%1:09:03:: .
But there is also a firm aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: to lexicostatistics---lexicostatistics%1:09:00:: :
the aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: of learning the internal organization---organization%1:09:00:: of obvious natural genetic groups---group%1:03:00:: of languages---language%1:10:00:: as well as their more remote and elusive external links---link%1:24:00:: ; of classification---classification%1:04:00:: first , with elapsed age---age%1:07:00:: merely a by-product---by-product%1:19:00:: ; of acquiring evidential knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of what happened in Athabascan---athabascan%1:10:00:: , in Yokuts---yokuts%1:10:00:: , in Uto-Aztecan---uto-aztecan%1:10:00:: in the last few thousand years---year%1:28:01:: as well as forecasting what more anciently may have happened between them .
This involves step-by-step progress---progress%1:04:00:: , and such will have to be the day-by-day work---work%1:04:00:: of lexicostatistics---lexicostatistics%1:09:00:: as a growing body---body%1:14:02:: of scientific inquiry---inquiry%1:09:01:: .
If of the founders---founder%1:18:00:: of glottochronology---glottochronology%1:09:00:: Swadesh---person%1:03:00:: has escaped our steady plodding---plodding%1:04:00:: , and Lees---person%1:03:00:: has repudiated his own share---share%1:04:01:: in the founding---founding%1:04:00:: , that is no reason---reason%1:16:00:: why we should swerve .
There is no apparent reason---reason%1:16:00:: why we should feel bound by Swadesh---person%1:03:00:: 's rules---rule%1:10:00:: and procedure---procedure%1:04:02:: since his predilections---predilection%1:09:00:: and aims---aim%1:09:00:: have grown so vast .
It seems time---time%1:11:00:: to consider a revision---revision%1:04:00:: of operational procedures---procedure%1:04:02:: for lexicostatistic studies---study%1:09:02:: on a more humble , solid , and limited basis---basis%1:09:00:: .
I would propose , first , an abandonment---abandonment%1:04:03:: of attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: at a universal lexical list---list%1:10:00:: , as intrinsically unachievable , and operationally inadequate in proportion---proportion%1:07:00:: as it is achieved .
I would propose , next , as the prime requirement---requirement%1:09:00:: for constitution---constitution%1:04:00:: of new basic lists---list%1:10:00:: , items---item%1:24:00:: whose forms---form%1:10:00:: show---show%1:10:03:: as high an empirical retention---retention%1:09:00:: rate---rate%1:28:00:: as possible .
There would be no conceivable sense---sense%1:09:04:: in going to the opposite extreme---extreme%1:07:00:: of selecting items---item%1:24:00:: whose forms---form%1:10:00:: are the most unstable .
An attempted middle course---course%1:04:00:: might lead to devices---device%1:06:00:: like a 5000 - word---word%1:10:00:: alphabetized dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: from which every fiftieth word---word%1:10:00:: was selected .
American democratic thought---thought%1:09:02:: , pointed up the relation---relation%1:03:00:: between the Protestant movement---movement%1:14:00:: in this country---country%1:14:01:: and the development---development%1:22:02:: of a social religion---religion%1:09:00:: , which he called the American Democratic Faith---faith%1:09:00:: .
Those familiar with his work---work%1:06:00:: will remember that he placed the incipience---incipience%1:28:00:: of the democratic faith---faith%1:09:00:: at around 1850 .
And he describes it as a balanced polarity---polarity%1:24:01:: between the notions---notion%1:09:02:: of the free individual---individual%1:03:00:: and what he called the fundamental law .
I want to say more about Gabriel---person%1:03:00:: 's so-called fundamental law .
But first I want to quote him on the relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: that he found between religion---religion%1:14:00:: and politics---politics%1:24:00:: in this country---country%1:14:01:: and what happened to it .
He points out that from the time---time%1:28:00:: of Jackson---person%1:03:00:: on through World War 1 , , evangelical Protestantism---protestantism%1:09:00:: was a dominant influence---influence%1:07:00:: in the social and political life---life%1:26:01:: of America---america%1:15:00:: .
He terms this early enthusiasm---enthusiasm%1:09:00:: `` Romantic Christianity '' and concludes that its similarity---similarity%1:07:00:: to democratic beliefs of that day---day%1:28:05:: is so great that `` the doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: of liberty---liberty%1:26:02:: seems but a secular version---version%1:09:01:: of its counterpart---counterpart%1:09:00:: in evangelical Protestantism---protestantism%1:09:00:: '' .
Let me quote him even more fully , for his analysis---analysis%1:10:00:: is important to my theme---theme%1:10:00:: .
He says : `` Beside the Protestant---protestant%1:14:00:: philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: of Progress , as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism---millenarianism%1:09:00:: , should be placed the doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: of the democratic faith---faith%1:09:00:: which affirmed it to be the duty---duty%1:04:02:: of the destiny---destiny%1:11:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: to assist in the creation---creation%1:04:00:: of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon---beacon%1:10:00:: of democracy---democracy%1:09:00:: '' .
He specifies , `` In the middle period---period%1:28:00:: of the Nineteenth Century---century%1:28:00:: it was colored by Christian supernaturalism---supernaturalism%1:09:00:: , in the Twentieth Century---century%1:28:00:: it was affected by naturalism---naturalism%1:09:00:: .
But in every period---period%1:28:00:: it has been humanism---humanism%1:09:01:: '' .
And let me add , utopianism---utopianism%1:09:00:: , also .
Some fourteen or fifteen years---year%1:28:01:: ago , in an essay---essay%1:10:00:: I called The Leader Follows - Where ?
I used his polarity---polarity%1:24:01:: to illustrate what I thought had happened to us in that form---form%1:09:01:: of liberalism---liberalism%1:09:00:: we call Progressivism---progressivism%1:09:00:: .
It seemed to me that the liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: had scrapped the balanced polarity---polarity%1:24:01:: and reposed both liberty---liberty%1:26:02:: and the fundamental law---fundamental_law%1:10:00:: in the common man---common_man%1:18:00:: .
That is to say Gabriel---person%1:03:00:: 's fundamental law---fundamental_law%1:10:00:: had been so much modified by this time---time%1:11:00:: that it was neither fundamental nor law---law%1:09:00:: any more .
It is a weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: of Gabriel---person%1:03:00:: 's analysis---analysis%1:09:00:: that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law---fundamental_law%1:10:00:: had already been cut loose from its foundations---foundation%1:24:00:: when it was adapted to democracy---democracy%1:09:00:: .
And with Progressivism---progressivism%1:09:00:: the Religion of Humanity was replacing what Gabriel---person%1:03:00:: called Christian supernaturalism---supernaturalism%1:09:00:: .
And the common man---common_man%1:18:00:: was developing mythic power---power%1:07:00:: , or charisma---charisma%1:07:00:: , on his own .
During the decade---decade%1:28:00:: that followed , the common man---common_man%1:18:00:: , as that piece---piece%1:10:02:: put it , grew uncomfortable as the Voice---voice%1:18:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: and fled from behind Saint Woodrow ( Wilson---person%1:03:00:: ) only to learn from Science , to his shocked relief---relief%1:12:00:: that after all there was no God---god%1:18:00:: he had to speak for and that he was just an animal---animal%1:03:00:: anyhow - that there was a chemical formula---chemical_formula%1:10:00:: for him , and that too much---much%1:23:00:: could n't be expected of him .
The socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: implicit in the slogan---slogan%1:10:00:: of the Roosevelt---roosevelt%1:18:02:: Revolution---revolution%1:11:01:: , freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: from want---want%1:26:00:: and fear---fear%1:12:00:: , seems a far cry---cry%1:10:03:: from the individualism---individualism%1:09:01:: of the First Amendment to the Constitution , or of the Jacksonian frontier---frontier%1:15:00:: .
What had happened to the common man---common_man%1:18:00:: ?
French Egalitarianism---egalitarianism%1:09:00:: had had only nominal influence---influence%1:07:00:: in this country---country%1:14:00:: before the days---day%1:28:03:: of Popularism .
The riotous onrush---onrush%1:11:00:: of industrialism---industrialism%1:14:00:: after the War for Southern Independence and the general secular drift---drift%1:22:01:: to the Religion of Humanity , however , prepared the way---way%1:04:00:: for a reception---reception%1:10:01:: of the French Revolution---french_revolution%1:04:00:: 's socialistic offspring---offspring%1:11:00:: of one sort---sort%1:09:00:: of another .
The first---first%1:24:00:: of which to find important place---place%1:09:00:: in our federal government---federal_government%1:14:00:: was the graduated income tax---income_tax%1:21:00:: under Wilson---person%1:03:00:: .
Moreover the centralization---centralization%1:04:00:: of our economy---economy%1:14:00:: during the 1920 s , the dislocations---dislocation%1:04:00:: of the Depression---depression%1:26:02:: , the common ethos---ethos%1:07:00:: of Materialism---materialism%1:26:00:: everywhere , all contributed in various ways---way%1:07:01:: to the face-lifting---face_lifting%1:04:01:: that replaced Mike Fink---person%1:03:00:: and the Great Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy---physiognomy%1:08:00:: of the Little People .
However , it is important to trace the philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: of the French Revolution---french_revolution%1:04:00:: to its sources---source%1:15:00:: to understand the common democratic origin---origin%1:11:00:: of individualism---individualism%1:09:00:: and socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: and the influence---influence%1:19:00:: of the latter on the former .
That John Locke---john_locke%1:18:00:: 's philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: of the social contract---social_contract%1:26:00:: fathered the American Revolution---american_revolution%1:04:00:: with its Declaration of Independence---declaration_of_independence%1:10:00:: , I believe , we generally accept .
Yet , after Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: had given the social contract---social_contract%1:26:00:: a new twist---twist%1:10:00:: with his notion---notion%1:09:02:: of the General Will---will%1:09:00:: , the same philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: , it may be said , became the idea---idea%1:09:00:: source---source%1:09:00:: of the French Revolution---french_revolution%1:04:00:: also .
The importance---importance%1:07:00:: of Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: 's twist---twist%1:10:00:: has not always been clear to us , however .
This notion---notion%1:09:00:: of the General Will---will%1:09:00:: gave rise to the Commune of Paris in the Revolution and later brought Napoleon---napoleon%1:18:00:: to dictatorship---dictatorship%1:14:00:: .
And it is clearly argued by Lord Percy---person%1:03:00:: of Newcastle---newcastle%1:15:00:: , in his remarkable long essay---essay%1:10:00:: , The Heresy of Democracy , and in a more general way---way%1:07:01:: by Voegelin---person%1:03:00:: , in his New Science of Politics , that this same Rousseauan idea---idea%1:09:00:: , descending through European democracy---democracy%1:09:00:: , is the source---source%1:09:00:: of Marx---person%1:03:00:: 's theory---theory%1:09:01:: of the dictatorship---dictatorship%1:14:00:: of the proletariat---proletariat%1:14:00:: .
This is important to understanding the position---position%1:09:01:: that doctrinaire liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: found themselves in after World War 2 , and our great democratic victory---victory%1:11:00:: that brought no peace---peace%1:26:01:: .
The long road---road%1:04:00:: that had taken liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: in this country---country%1:14:01:: into the social religion---religion%1:09:00:: of democracy---democracy%1:09:00:: , into a worship---worship%1:04:00:: of man , led logically to the Marxist dream---dream%1:12:00:: of a classless society---society%1:14:00:: under a Socialist State---state%1:14:01:: .
And the USSR---ussr%1:15:00:: existed as the revolutionary experiment---experiment%1:09:00:: in radical socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: , the ultimate exemplar---exemplar%1:09:00:: .
And by the time---time%1:28:06:: the war---war%1:26:00:: ended , liberal leadership---leadership%1:14:00:: in this country---country%1:15:00:: was spiritually Marxist .
We will recall that the still confident liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: of the Truman---person%1:03:00:: administration---administration%1:14:00:: gathered with other Western utopians---utopian%1:18:00:: in San Francisco---san_francisco%1:15:00:: to set up the legal framework---framework%1:07:00:: , finally and at last , to rationalize war---war%1:04:00:: - to rationalize want---want%1:26:00:: and fear---fear%1:12:00:: - out of the world : the United Nations---united_nations%1:14:00:: .
We of the liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: led world got all set for peace---peace%1:26:01:: and rehabilitation---rehabilitation%1:04:00:: .
Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle---middle%1:15:00:: of another fight---fight%1:04:02:: , an irrational , an indecent , an undeclared and immoral war---war%1:04:00:: with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally---ally%1:14:00:: .
During the next five years---year%1:28:01:: the leaders---leaders%1:14:00:: of the Fair Deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations---expectation%1:09:00:: of the New Deal---new_deal%1:10:00:: .
During the next five years---year%1:28:01:: liberal leaders---leaders%1:14:00:: in the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: sank in the cumulative confusion---confusion%1:09:00:: attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy---policy%1:09:00:: of Containment - and the bitterest irony---irony%1:07:00:: - enforced and enforceable only by threat---threat%1:10:01:: of a weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: that we felt the greatest distaste---distaste%1:12:00:: for but could not abandon :
the atom bomb---atom_bomb%1:06:00:: .
In 1952 , it will be remembered , the G. O. P.---group%1:03:00:: without positive program---program%1:10:04:: campaigned on the popular disillusionment---disillusionment%1:09:00:: with liberal leadership---leadership%1:14:00:: and won overwhelmingly .
All of this , I know , is recent history---history%1:10:00:: familiar to you .
But I have been at some pains---pains%1:04:00:: to review it as the drama---drama%1:11:00:: of the common man---common_man%1:18:00:: , to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower---person%1:03:00:: 's leadership---leadership%1:04:00:: .
A perceptive journalist---journalist%1:18:00:: , Sam Lubell---person%1:03:00:: , has phrased it in the title---title%1:10:01:: of one---one%1:23:00:: of his books---book%1:10:00:: as The Revolt---revolt%1:04:00:: Of The Moderates---moderate%1:18:00:: .
He opens his discourse---discourse%1:10:01:: , however , with a review---review%1:10:01:: of the Eisenhower---person%1:03:00:: inaugural festivities---festivity%1:04:00:: at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents---talent%1:18:00:: , all primed to catch some revelation---revelation%1:10:02:: of the emerging new age---age%1:28:02:: .
The show---show%1:10:03:: was colorful , indeed , exuberant , but the press for all its assiduity---assiduity%1:07:00:: could detect no note---note%1:07:00:: of a fateful rendezvous---rendezvous%1:04:00:: with destiny---destiny%1:18:00:: .
Lubell---person%1:03:00:: offers his book---book%1:10:00:: as an explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: of why there was no clue---clue%1:10:00:: .
And I select this sentence---sentence%1:10:00:: as its pertinent summation---summation%1:10:00:: : `` In essence the drama---drama%1:11:00:: of his ( Eisenhower---person%1:03:00:: 's ) Presidency---presidency%1:28:00:: can be described as the ordeal---ordeal%1:11:00:: of a nation---nation%1:14:00:: turned conservative and struggling - thus far with but limited and precarious success---success%1:04:00:: - to give effective voice---voice%1:10:01:: and force---force%1:07:01:: to that conservatism---conservatism%1:09:00:: '' .
I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: , with its limited and precarious success---success%1:11:00:: , toward conservatism---conservatism%1:09:00:: .
It has moved on various levels---level%1:26:00:: , it has been clamorous and confused .
Obviously there has been no agreement---agreement%1:07:00:: on what American---american%1:18:00:: conservatism---conservatism%1:09:00:: is , or rather , what it should be .
For it was neglected , not to say nascent , when the struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: began .
I saw a piece---piece%1:10:02:: the other day---day%1:28:03:: assailing William Buckley---person%1:03:00:: , author---author%1:18:00:: of Man And God At Yale and publisher---publisher%1:18:00:: of the National Review , as no conservative---conservative%1:18:00:: at all , but an old liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: .
I would agree with this view---view%1:09:04:: .
But I 'm not here to define conservatism---conservatism%1:09:00:: .
What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations---gyration%1:11:00:: of the struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: - a struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: that amounts to self---self%1:09:00:: redefinition---redefinition%1:10:00:: - to see if we can predict its future course---course%1:04:00:: .
One---one%1:23:00:: of the obvious conclusions---conclusion%1:09:01:: we can make on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of the last election---election%1:04:01:: , I suppose , is that we , the majority---majority%1:23:00:: , were dissatisfied with Eisenhower---person%1:03:00:: conservatism---conservatism%1:09:00:: .
Though , to be sure , we gave Kennedy---person%1:03:00:: no very positive approval---approval%1:04:02:: in the margin---margin%1:25:00:: of his preferment---preferment%1:04:00:: .
This is , however , symptomatic of our national malaise---malaise%1:26:00:: .
But before I try to diagnose it , I would offer other evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: .
I will mention two volumes---volume%1:10:00:: of specific comment---comment%1:10:01:: on this malaise---malaise%1:26:00:: that appeared last year---year%1:28:01:: .
The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise---enterprise%1:04:00:: , sponsored by Life magazine---magazine%1:14:00:: , under the title---title%1:10:00:: of the National purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: .
The contributors---contributor%1:18:01:: to this testament---testament%1:09:00:: were all well-known :
a former Democratic candidate---candidate%1:18:01:: for President---president%1:04:04:: , a New Deal---new_deal%1:28:00:: poet---poet%1:18:00:: , the magazine---magazine%1:10:00:: 's chief editorial---editorial%1:10:00:: writer---writer%1:18:00:: , two newspaper columnists---newspaper_columnist%1:18:00:: , head---head%1:18:00:: of a national broadcasting company---broadcasting_company%1:14:00:: , a popular Protestant---protestant%1:14:00:: evangelist---evangelist%1:18:00:: , etc. .
What I want to point out here is that all of them are ex liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: , or modified liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: , with perhaps one exception---exception%1:09:01:: .
I suppose we might classify Billy Graham---person%1:03:00:: as an old liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: .
And I would further note that they all - with one exception---exception%1:09:01:: again - sang in one key---key%1:10:00:: or another the same song---song%1:10:00:: .
Its refrain---refrain%1:10:00:: was : `` Let us return to the individualistic democracy---democracy%1:14:00:: of our forefathers---forefather%1:18:00:: for our salvation---salvation%1:04:01:: '' .
Adlai Stevenson---person%1:03:00:: expressed some reservations---reservation%1:09:00:: about this return---return%1:04:02:: .
Others invoked technology---technology%1:09:00:: and common sense---common_sense%1:09:00:: .
Only Walter Lippman---person%1:03:00:: envisioned the possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: of our having `` outlived most of what we used to regard as the program---program%1:09:01:: of our national purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: '' .
But the most notable thing---thing%1:09:00:: about the incantation---incantation%1:10:00:: of these ex liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: was that the one-time shibboleth---shibboleth%1:10:00:: of socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: was conspicuously absent .
The second specific comment---comment%1:10:00:: was the report---report%1:10:03:: of Eisenhower---person%1:03:00:: 's Commission on National Goals , titled Goals For Americans .
They , perhaps , gave the pitch---pitch%1:10:00:: of their position---position%1:09:00:: in the preface---preface%1:10:00:: where it was said that Eisenhower---person%1:03:00:: requested that the Commission---commission%1:14:00:: be administered by the American Assembly of Columbia University---group%1:03:00:: , because it was non-partisan .
The Commission---commission%1:14:00:: seems to represent the viewpoint---viewpoint%1:09:00:: of what I would call the unconscious liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: , but not unconscious enough , to invoke the now taboo symbolism---symbolism%1:10:00:: of socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: .
And here again we hear the same refrain---refrain%1:10:00:: mentioned above : `` The paramount goal---goal%1:09:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: , set long ago , was to guard the rights---right%1:07:00:: of the individual---individual%1:03:00:: , ensure his development---development%1:22:02:: , enlarge his opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: '' .
This group---group%1:03:00:: is secularist---secularist%1:18:00:: and their program---program%1:10:04:: tends to be technological .
But it is the need---need%1:17:00:: to undertake these testaments---testament%1:09:00:: that I would submit here as symptom---symptom%1:10:00:: of the common man---common_man%1:18:00:: 's malaise---malaise%1:26:00:: .
And let me add Murray---person%1:03:00:: 's new book---book%1:10:00:: as another symptom---symptom%1:10:00:: of it , particularly so in view of the attention---attention%1:09:02:: Time magazine---magazine%1:10:00:: gave it when it came out recently .
Father Murray---person%1:03:00:: goes back to the Declaration of Independence---declaration_of_independence%1:10:00:: , too , though I may add , with considerably more historical perception---perception%1:09:02:: .
I will reserve discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: of it for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: , however , to return to President Kennedy---person%1:03:00:: .
As symptomatic of the common man---common_man%1:18:00:: 's malaise---malaise%1:26:00:: , he is most significant : a liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: and a Catholic---catholic%1:18:00:: , elected by the skin of his teeth .
Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy , not to say confused , state---state%1:03:00:: of the public mind---mind%1:09:04:: ?
What is the common man---common_man%1:18:00:: 's complaint---complaint%1:26:00:: ?
Let 's take a panoramic look---look%1:04:00:: back over the course---course%1:14:00:: we have come .
Has not that way---way%1:04:00:: been lit always by the lamp---lamp%1:06:00:: of liberalism---liberalism%1:09:00:: up until the turning---turning%1:04:00:: back under Eisenhower---person%1:03:00:: ?
And the basic character---character%1:07:01:: of that liberalism---liberalism%1:09:00:: has been spiritual rather than economic .
Ralph Gabriel---person%1:03:00:: gave it the name---name%1:10:00:: of Protestant philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: of Progress---progress%1:04:01:: .
But there 's a subjective side---side%1:09:00:: to that utopian outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: .
Strategy---strategy%1:09:00:: and tactics---tactics%1:09:01:: of the U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: military forces---military_force%1:14:00:: are now undergoing one of the greatest transitions---transition%1:11:00:: in history---history%1:28:00:: .
The change---change%1:24:00:: of emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: from conventional type---type%1:09:00:: to missile---missile%1:06:01:: type---type%1:09:00:: warfare---warfare%1:04:00:: must be made with care---care%1:09:00:: , mindful that the one type---type%1:09:00:: of warfare---warfare%1:04:00:: cannot be safely neglected in favor---favor%1:09:00:: of the other .
Our military forces---military_force%1:14:00:: must be capable of contending successfully with any contingency---contingency%1:11:00:: which may be forced upon us , from limited emergencies---emergency%1:11:00:: to all-out nuclear general war---war%1:04:00:: .
- This budget---budget%1:21:02:: will provide in the fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: 1961 for the continued support---support%1:04:00:: of our forces---force%1:14:00:: at approximately the present level---level%1:07:00:: - a year-end---year-end%1:28:00:: strength---strength%1:07:01:: of 2489000 men---man%1:18:00:: and women---woman%1:18:00:: in the active forces---force%1:14:00:: .
The forces---force%1:14:00:: to be supported include an Army---army%1:14:00:: of 14 divisions---division%1:14:00:: and 870000 men---men%1:14:00:: ; a Navy---navy%1:14:00:: of 817 active ships---ship%1:06:00:: and 619000 men---men%1:14:00:: ; a Marine Corps---marine_corps%1:14:00:: of 3 divisions---division%1:14:00:: and 3 air wings---wing%1:14:00:: with 175000 men---men%1:14:00:: ; and an Air Force---air_force%1:14:00:: of 91 combat---combat%1:04:00:: wings---wing%1:14:00:: and 825000 men---men%1:14:00:: .
If the reserve components---component%1:09:00:: are to serve effectively in time---time%1:28:00:: of war---war%1:04:00:: , their basic organization---organization%1:09:00:: and objectives---objective%1:09:00:: must conform to the changing character---character%1:09:00:: and missions---mission%1:04:00:: of the active forces---force%1:14:00:: .
Quality---quality%1:07:02:: and combat---combat%1:04:00:: readiness---readiness%1:26:00:: must take precedence---precedence%1:26:00:: over mere numbers---number%1:07:00:: .
Under modern conditions---condition%1:26:00:: , this is especially true of the ready reserve---reserves%1:14:00:: .
I have requested the Secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: of Defense---defense%1:04:00:: to reexamine the roles---role%1:04:00:: and missions---mission%1:04:01:: of the reserve components---component%1:09:00:: in relation to those of the active forces---force%1:14:00:: and in the light---light%1:09:01:: of the changing requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: of modern warfare---warfare%1:04:00:: .
Last year---year%1:28:01:: the Congress---congress%1:14:01:: discontinued its previously imposed minimum personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: strength---strength%1:07:05:: limitations---limitation%1:09:00:: on the Army Reserve---group%1:03:00:: .
Similar restrictions---restriction%1:09:00:: on the strength---strength%1:07:00:: of the Army---army%1:14:00:: National Guard---national_guard%1:14:00:: contained in the 1960 Department of Defense---department_of_defense%1:14:00:: Appropriation Act should likewise be dropped .
I strongly recommend to the Congress---congress%1:14:01:: the avoidance---avoidance%1:04:00:: of mandatory floors---floor%1:10:00:: on the size---size%1:07:00:: of the reserve components---component%1:09:00:: so that we may have the flexibility---flexibility%1:07:01:: to make adjustments---adjustment%1:04:00:: in keeping with military necessity---necessity%1:17:00:: .
I again proposed a reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: in the Army---army%1:14:00:: National Guard---national_guard%1:14:00:: and Army Reserve---group%1:03:00:: - from their present strengths---strength%1:07:05:: of 400000 and 300000 , respectively , to 360000 and 270000 by the end---end%1:28:00:: of the fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: 1961 .
These strengths---strength%1:07:05:: are considered adequate to meet the essential roles---role%1:07:00:: and missions---mission%1:04:01:: of the reserves---reserves%1:14:00:: in support---support%1:04:00:: of our national security---security%1:26:00:: objectives---objective%1:09:00:: .
- About 30 % of the expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: for the Department of Defense---department_of_defense%1:14:00:: in 1961 are for military personnel---military_personnel%1:14:00:: costs---cost%1:21:00:: , including pay---pay%1:21:01:: for active , reserve , and retired military personnel---military_personnel%1:14:00:: .
These expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: are estimated to be $ 12.1 billion---billion%1:23:01:: , an increase---increase%1:23:00:: of $ 187 million---million%1:23:00:: over 1960 , reflecting additional longevity---longevity%1:07:00:: pay---pay%1:21:01:: of career---career%1:04:00:: personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: , more dependents---dependent%1:18:00:: , an increased number---number%1:07:00:: of men---men%1:14:00:: drawing proficiency---proficiency%1:07:00:: pay---pay%1:21:01:: , and social security---social_security%1:04:00:: tax---tax%1:21:00:: increases---increase%1:11:00:: ( effective for the full year---year%1:28:01:: in 1961 compared with only 6 months---month%1:28:00:: in 1960 ) .
Retired pay---pay%1:21:01:: costs---cost%1:21:00:: are increased by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 , partly because of a substantial increase---increase%1:11:00:: in the number---number%1:07:00:: of retired personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: .
These increased costs---cost%1:21:00:: are partially offset by a decrease---decrease%1:11:00:: of $ 56 million in expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: for the reserve forces---force%1:14:00:: , largely because of the planned reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: in strength---strength%1:07:05:: of the Army Reserve---group%1:03:00:: components---component%1:24:00:: during 1961 .
Traditionally , rates of pay---rate_of_pay%1:21:00:: for retired military personnel---military_personnel%1:18:00:: have been proportionate to current rates of pay---rate_of_pay%1:21:00:: for active personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: .
The 1958 military pay---pay%1:21:01:: act---act%1:10:01:: departed from this established formula---formula%1:10:01:: by providing for a 6 % increase---increase%1:11:00:: rather than a proportionate increase---increase%1:11:00:: for everyone retired prior to its effective date---date%1:28:00:: of June---june%1:28:00:: 1 , 1958 .
I endorse pending legislation---legislation%1:10:00:: that will restore the traditional relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: between retired and active duty---duty%1:04:02:: pay rates---pay_rate%1:21:00:: .
- Expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: for operating and maintaining the stations---station%1:06:00:: and equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: of the Armed Forces---armed_forces%1:14:00:: are estimated to be $ 10.3 billion in 1961 , which is $ 184 million more than in 1960 .
The increase---increase%1:11:00:: stems largely from the growing complexity---complexity%1:07:00:: of and higher degree---degree%1:07:00:: of maintenance---maintenance%1:04:00:: required for newer weapons---weapon%1:06:00:: and equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: .
A substantial increase---increase%1:11:00:: is estimated in the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of operating additional communications systems---communication_system%1:06:01:: in the air defense program---defense_program%1:09:00:: , as well as in all programs---program%1:09:00:: where speed---speed%1:28:00:: and security---security%1:26:00:: of communications---communication%1:03:00:: are essential .
Also , the program---program%1:09:00:: for fleet---fleet%1:14:03:: modernization---modernization%1:04:00:: will be stepped up in 1961 causing an increase---increase%1:11:00:: in expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: .
Further increases---increase%1:11:00:: arise from the civilian employee---employee%1:18:00:: health---health%1:26:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: enacted by the Congress---congress%1:14:01:: last year---year%1:28:01:: .
Other factors---factor%1:11:00:: increasing operating costs---operating_cost%1:21:00:: include the higher unit cost---unit_cost%1:21:00:: of each flying hour---hour%1:28:00:: , up 11 % in two years---year%1:28:01:: , and of each steaming hour---hour%1:28:00:: , up 15 % .
In total , these increases---increase%1:11:00:: in operating costs---operating_cost%1:21:00:: outweigh the savings---savings%1:21:00:: that result from declining programs---program%1:09:00:: and from economy---economy%1:14:00:: measures---measure%1:04:01:: , such as reduced numbers---number%1:23:00:: of units---unit%1:24:00:: and installations---installation%1:06:00:: , smaller inventories---inventory%1:06:00:: of major equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: , and improvements---improvement%1:04:00:: in the supply---supply%1:04:00:: and distribution---distribution%1:04:00:: systems---system%1:06:00:: of the Armed Forces---armed_forces%1:14:00:: .
In the budget---budget%1:21:03:: message---message%1:10:00:: for 1959 , and again for 1960 , I recommended immediate repeal---repeal%1:04:00:: of section---section%1:10:00:: 601 of the Act---act%1:10:01:: of September---september%1:28:00:: 28 , 1951 ( 65 Stat. 365 ) .
This section---section%1:10:00:: prevents the military departments---department%1:14:00:: and the Office---office%1:14:01:: of Civil and Defense---defense%1:04:00:: Mobilization---mobilization%1:04:01:: from carrying out certain transactions---transaction%1:04:00:: involving real property---real_property%1:21:00:: unless they come into agreement---agreement%1:26:01:: with the Committees on Armed Services---group%1:03:00:: of the Senate---senate%1:14:01:: and the House of Representatives---house_of_representatives%1:14:00:: .
As I have stated previously , the Attorney General---attorney_general%1:18:00:: has advised me that this section---section%1:10:00:: violates fundamental constitutional principles---principle%1:09:00:: .
Accordingly , if it is not repealed by the Congress---congress%1:14:01:: at its present session---session%1:10:00:: , I shall have no alternative---alternative%1:09:00:: thereafter but to direct the Secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: of Defense---defense%1:04:00:: to disregard the section---section%1:10:00:: unless a court---court%1:14:00:: of competent jurisdiction---jurisdiction%1:07:02:: determines otherwise .
Basic long line---line%1:06:01:: communications---communication%1:10:01:: in Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: are now provided through Federal facilities---facility%1:06:00:: operated by the Army---army%1:14:00:: , Air Force---air_force%1:14:00:: , and Federal Aviation Agency---group%1:03:00:: .
The growing communications---communication%1:10:01:: needs---need%1:26:00:: of this new State---state%1:15:01:: can best be met , as they have in other States---state%1:15:01:: , through the operation and development---development%1:04:01:: of such facilities---facility%1:06:00:: by private enterprise---enterprise%1:14:00:: .
Legislation---legislation%1:10:00:: has already been proposed to authorize the sale---sale%1:04:00:: of these Government---government%1:14:00:: owned systems---system%1:06:00:: in Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: , and its early enactment---enactment%1:04:01:: is desirable .
- Approximately 45 % of the expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: for the Department of Defense---department_of_defense%1:14:00:: are for procurement---procurement%1:04:00:: , research---research%1:04:00:: , development---development%1:04:01:: , and construction---construction%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: .
In 1961 , these expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: are estimated at $ 18.9 billion , compared to $ 19.3 billion in 1960 .
The decreases---decrease%1:11:00:: , which are largely in construction---construction%1:04:00:: and in aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: procurement---procurement%1:04:00:: , are offset in part by increases---increase%1:23:00:: for research---research%1:04:00:: and development---development%1:04:01:: and for procurement---procurement%1:04:00:: of other military equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: such as tanks---tank%1:06:01:: , vehicles---vehicle%1:06:00:: , guns---gun%1:06:00:: , and electronic devices---electronic_device%1:06:00:: .
Expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: for shipbuilding---shipbuilding%1:04:00:: are estimated at about the same level---level%1:07:00:: as in 1960 .
New obligational authority---authority%1:07:00:: for 1961 recommended in this budget---budget%1:21:03:: for aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: procurement---procurement%1:04:00:: ( excluding amounts---amount%1:21:00:: for related research---research%1:04:00:: and construction---construction%1:04:00:: ) totals $ 4753 million , which is $ 1390 million below that enacted for 1960 .
On the other hand , the new authority---authority%1:07:00:: of $ 3825 million proposed for missile---missile%1:06:01:: procurement---procurement%1:04:00:: ( excluding research---research%1:04:00:: and construction---construction%1:04:00:: ) in 1961 is $ 581 million higher than for 1960 .
These contrasting trends---trend%1:15:02:: in procurement---procurement%1:04:00:: reflect the anticipated changes---change%1:11:00:: in the composition---composition%1:07:01:: and missions---mission%1:04:01:: of our Armed Forces---armed_forces%1:14:00:: in the years---year%1:28:01:: ahead .
The Department of Defense---department_of_defense%1:14:00:: appropriation---appropriation%1:21:00:: acts---act%1:10:01:: for the past several years---year%1:28:01:: have contained a rider---rider%1:10:00:: which limits competitive bidding by firms---firm%1:14:00:: in other countries---country%1:14:00:: on certain military supply---supply%1:23:00:: items---item%1:06:00:: .
As I have repeatedly stated , this provision---provision%1:10:00:: is much more restrictive than the general law---law%1:14:00:: , popularly known as the Buy American Act---act%1:10:01:: .
I urge once again that the Congress---congress%1:14:01:: not reenact this rider---rider%1:10:00:: .
The task---task%1:04:01:: of providing a reasonable level---level%1:07:00:: of military strength---strength%1:07:00:: , without endangering other vital aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: of our security---security%1:26:00:: , is greatly complicated by the swift pace---pace%1:07:01:: of scientific progress---progress%1:04:01:: .
The last few years---year%1:28:01:: have witnessed what have been perhaps the most rapid advances---advance%1:11:01:: in military technology---technology%1:04:00:: in history---history%1:28:02:: .
Some weapons systems---weapons_system%1:06:00:: have become obsolescent while still in production---production%1:04:00:: , and some while still under development---development%1:04:01:: .
Furthermore , unexpectedly rapid progress---progress%1:04:01:: or a technological break-through---breakthrough%1:04:02:: on any one weapon system---weapon_system%1:06:00:: , in itself , often diminishes the relative importance---importance%1:07:00:: of other competitive systems---system%1:06:00:: .
This has necessitated a continuous review---review%1:09:00:: and reevaluation---reevaluation%1:09:00:: of the defense program---defense_program%1:09:00:: in order to redirect resources---resource%1:21:00:: to the newer and more important weapons systems---weapons_system%1:06:00:: and to eliminate or reduce effort---effort%1:04:01:: on weapons systems---weapons_system%1:06:00:: which have been overtaken by events---event%1:03:00:: .
Thus , in the last few years---year%1:28:01:: , a number---number%1:07:00:: of programs---program%1:09:00:: which looked very promising at the time---time%1:28:06:: their development---development%1:04:01:: was commenced have since been completely eliminated .
For example , the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of the Regulus 2 , , a very promising aerodynamic ship---ship%1:06:00:: to surface---surface%1:17:00:: missile---missile%1:06:01:: designed to be launched by surfaced submarines---submarine%1:06:00:: , was greatly diminished by the successful acceleration---acceleration%1:04:00:: of the much more advanced Polaris ballistic missile---ballistic_missile%1:06:00:: launched by submerged submarines---submarine%1:06:00:: .
Another example---example%1:09:00:: is the recent cancellation---cancellation%1:04:00:: of the F-108 , a long range---range%1:15:01:: interceptor---interceptor%1:06:00:: with a speed---speed%1:28:00:: three times as great as the speed---speed%1:28:00:: of sound---sound%1:19:00:: , which was designed for use---use%1:04:00:: against manned bombers---bomber%1:06:00:: in the period---period%1:28:00:: of the mid 1960 's .
The substantial progress---progress%1:04:01:: being made in ballistic missile---ballistic_missile%1:06:00:: technology---technology%1:04:00:: is rapidly shifting the main threat---threat%1:26:00:: from manned bombers---bomber%1:06:00:: to missiles---missile%1:06:01:: .
Considering the high cost---cost%1:21:00:: of the F-108 system---system%1:06:00:: - over $ 4 billion for the force---force%1:07:00:: that had been planned - and the time period---time_period%1:28:00:: in which it would become operational , it was decided to stop further work---work%1:04:00:: on the project---project%1:04:00:: .
Meanwhile , other air defense---air_defense%1:04:00:: forces---force%1:14:00:: are being made effective , as described later in this message---message%1:10:01:: .
The size---size%1:07:00:: and scope---scope%1:07:00:: of other important programs---program%1:09:00:: have been reduced from earlier plans---plan%1:09:00:: .
Notable in this category---category%1:14:00:: are the Jupiter and Thor intermediate range---range%1:15:01:: ballistic missiles---ballistic_missile%1:06:00:: , which have been successfully developed , produced , and deployed , but the relative importance---importance%1:07:00:: of which has diminished with the increasing availability---availability%1:07:00:: of the Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile---intercontinental_ballistic_missile%1:06:00:: .
The impact---impact%1:19:00:: of technological factors---factor%1:11:00:: is also illustrated by the history---history%1:10:00:: of the high energy---energy%1:19:00:: fuel---fuel%1:27:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: .
This project---project%1:04:00:: was started at a time---time%1:28:00:: when there was a critical need---need%1:26:00:: for a high energy---energy%1:19:00:: fuel---fuel%1:27:00:: to provide an extra margin---margin%1:07:00:: of range---range%1:15:01:: for high performance aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: , particularly our heavy bombers---bomber%1:06:00:: .
Continuing technical problems---problem%1:26:00:: involved in the use---use%1:04:00:: of this fuel---fuel%1:27:00:: , coupled with significant improvements---improvement%1:11:00:: in aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: range---range%1:15:01:: through other means---means%1:04:00:: , have now raised serious questions---question%1:10:00:: about the value---value%1:07:00:: of the high energy---energy%1:19:00:: fuel---fuel%1:27:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: .
As a result---result%1:19:00:: , the scope---scope%1:07:00:: of this project---project%1:04:00:: has been sharply curtailed .
These examples---example%1:09:00:: underscore the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of even more searching evaluations---evaluation%1:09:00:: of new major development---development%1:04:01:: programs---program%1:09:00:: and even more penetrating and far ranging analyses---analysis%1:04:00:: of the potentialities---potentiality%1:09:00:: of future technology---technology%1:04:00:: .
The cost---cost%1:21:00:: of developing a major weapon system---weapon_system%1:06:00:: is now so enormous that the greatest care---care%1:09:00:: must be exercised in selecting new systems---system%1:06:00:: for development---development%1:04:01:: , in determining the most satisfactory rate---rate%1:28:00:: of development---development%1:04:01:: , and in deciding the proper time---time%1:28:06:: at which either to place a system---system%1:06:00:: into production---production%1:04:00:: or to abandon it .
- The deterrent---deterrent%1:09:00:: power---power%1:07:00:: of our Armed Forces---armed_forces%1:14:00:: comes from both their nuclear retaliatory capability---capability%1:07:00:: and their capability---capability%1:07:00:: to conduct other essential operations---operation%1:04:02:: in any form---form%1:09:01:: of war---war%1:04:00:: .
The first capability---capability%1:07:00:: is represented by a combination---combination%1:14:00:: of manned bombers---bomber%1:06:00:: , carrier---carrier%1:06:01:: based aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: , and intercontinental and intermediate range---range%1:15:01:: missiles---missile%1:06:01:: .
The second capability---capability%1:07:00:: is represented by our deployed ground---ground%1:17:00:: , naval , and air---air%1:15:00:: forces---force%1:14:01:: in essential forward areas---area%1:15:01:: , together with ready reserves---reserves%1:14:00:: capable of effecting early emergency---emergency%1:11:00:: reinforcement---reinforcement%1:04:01:: .
The Strategic Air Command---group%1:03:00:: is the principal element---element%1:09:00:: of our long range nuclear capability---capability%1:07:00:: .
One of the important and difficult decisions---decision%1:04:00:: which had to be made in this budget---budget%1:21:03:: concerned the role---role%1:07:00:: of the B-70 , a long range---range%1:15:01:: supersonic bomber---bomber%1:06:00:: .
This aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: , which was planned for initial operational use---use%1:04:00:: about 1965 , would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile---ballistic_missile%1:06:00:: systems---system%1:06:00:: , all of which are scheduled to become available earlier .
The first Atlas ICBM---icbm%1:06:00:: 's are now operational , the first two Polaris submarines---submarine%1:06:00:: are expected to be operational this calendar year---calendar_year%1:28:00:: , and the first Titan ICBM---icbm%1:06:00:: 's next year---year%1:28:01:: .
The Minuteman solid fueled ICBM---icbm%1:06:00:: is planned to be operational about mid 1963 .
By 1965 , several or all of these systems---system%1:06:00:: will have been fully tested and their reliability---reliability%1:07:00:: established .
Thus , the need---need%1:26:00:: for the B-70 as a strategic weapon system---weapon_system%1:06:00:: is doubtful .
However , I am recommending that development---development%1:04:01:: work---work%1:04:00:: on the B-70 air-frame---airframe%1:06:00:: and engines---engine%1:06:00:: be continued .
It is expected that in 1963 two prototype---prototype%1:09:00:: aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: will be available for flight---flight%1:04:00:: testing---testing%1:04:00:: .
By that time---time%1:28:06:: we should be in a much better position---position%1:26:00:: to determine the value---value%1:07:00:: of that aircraft---aircraft%1:06:00:: as a weapon system---weapon_system%1:06:00:: .
I am recommending additional acquisitions---acquisition%1:04:00:: of the improved version---version%1:09:01:: of the B-52---b-52%1:06:00:: ( the B-52 H with the new turbofan engine---turbofan_engine%1:06:00:: ) and procurement---procurement%1:04:00:: of the B-58 supersonic medium bomber---bomber%1:06:00:: , together with the supporting refueling---refueling%1:04:00:: tankers---tanker%1:06:00:: in each case---case%1:11:00:: .
These additional modern bombers---bomber%1:06:00:: will replace some of the older B-47 medium bombers---bomber%1:06:00:: ; one B-52---b-52%1:06:00:: can do the work---work%1:04:01:: of several B-47 's which it will replace .
Funds---funds%1:21:00:: are also included in this budget---budget%1:21:02:: to continue the equipping---equipping%1:04:00:: of the B-52---b-52%1:06:00:: wings---wing%1:06:00:: with the Hound Dog air-to-surface missile---air-to-surface_missile%1:06:00:: .
In the coming fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: additional quantities---quantity%1:07:00:: of Atlas , Titan , and Polaris missiles---missile%1:06:01:: also will be procured .
The two of them against the world---world%1:17:01:: .
For when he began to talk and dream all at the same time , making his plans---plan%1:09:00:: as he went , she had begun dreaming too .
But now the dream---dream%1:09:02:: was over .
The big waking up---waking_up%1:04:00:: had happened .
Or maybe poling up the south fork---fork%1:25:00:: of the Forked Deer River---location%1:03:00:: braving the wastes---waste%1:27:00:: dumped in it ?
Maybe I saw him on a barge---barge%1:06:00:: with a gang---gang%1:14:00:: of Ethiopians---ethiopian%1:18:00:: poling it '' .
Wednesday---wednesday%1:28:00:: nights---night%1:28:00:: after youth---youth%1:18:00:: fellowship---fellowship%1:14:00:: .
Out of the church---church%1:06:00:: and into his big car---car%1:06:00:: , it tooling over the road---road%1:06:00:: with him driving and the headlights---headlight%1:06:00:: sweeping the pike---pike%1:06:01:: ahead and after he hit college---college%1:14:00:: , his expansiveness---expansiveness%1:07:02:: , the quaint little pine---pine%1:20:02:: board---board%1:27:00:: tourist courts---tourist_court%1:06:00:: , cabins---cabin%1:06:02:: really , with a cute naked light bulb---light_bulb%1:06:00:: in the ceiling---ceiling%1:06:00:: ( unfrosted and naked as a streetlight---streetlight%1:06:00:: , like the one on the corner---corner%1:06:00:: where you used to play when you were a kid---kid%1:18:00:: , where you watched the bats---bat%1:05:00:: swooping in after the bugs---bug%1:05:02:: , watching in between your bouts---bout%1:28:00:: at hopscotch---hopscotch%1:04:00:: ) , a room---room%1:06:00:: complete with moths---moth%1:05:00:: pinging the light---light%1:06:00:: and the few casual cockroaches---cockroach%1:05:00:: cruising the walls---wall%1:06:00:: , an insect---insect%1:05:00:: Highway Patrol---group%1:03:00:: with feelers---feeler%1:05:01:: waving .
And the bed---bed%1:06:00:: that sagged in a certain place---place%1:15:00:: where all the weight---weight%1:07:00:: had been put too many times---time%1:11:00:: before and the walls---wall%1:06:00:: fine and thin for overhearing talk---talk%1:10:00:: in the next room---room%1:06:00:: when Gratt---person%1:03:00:: went out for ice---ice%1:27:00:: , the sound---sound%1:09:00:: coming through the walls---wall%1:06:00:: like something on the other side---side%1:15:02:: of the curtain---curtain%1:06:00:: , so you knew they heard you when they were quiet and while you lay wondering what they had heard you listened .
And Gratt Shafer---person%1:03:00:: would be in Memphis---memphis%1:15:00:: today for the wedding---wedding%1:11:00:: rehearsal---rehearsal%1:04:01:: and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody knew he would , just like everybody knew all along .
Like Mattie---person%1:03:00:: and the mayor---mayor%1:18:00:: up there gripping the microphone---microphone%1:06:00:: and Toonker Burkette---person%1:03:00:: back in his office---office%1:06:00:: yanking out teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: , like they all knew he would .
Just like the balloon---balloon%1:06:00:: would go up and you could sit all day---day%1:28:00:: and wish it would spring a leak---leak%1:17:00:: or blow to hell up and burn and nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: like that would happen .
Or you could hope the parachute---parachute%1:06:00:: would n't open just so you could say you saw it not open , not because you meant any harm---harm%1:26:00:: to Starkey Poe---person%1:03:00:: in his suit---suit%1:06:00:: of red underwear---underwear%1:06:00:: , but mainly because you were tired of being an old maid---old_maid%1:18:00:: - a thing---thing%1:06:01:: which cannot admit when it thinks it might be pregnant , but must stand the dizzy feeling---feeling%1:09:01:: all alone and go on like everything is all right instead of being able to say to somebody in a normal voice---voice%1:07:00:: : `` I think I 'm pregnant '' .
Or you could wish your daddy---daddy%1:18:00:: would really do it - kill Gratt Shafer---person%1:03:00:: like he said when you all the time , all along , could feel the nerve---nerve%1:07:00:: draining out of him like air---air%1:27:00:: out of a punctured tire---tire%1:06:00:: when you are on a muddy road---road%1:06:00:: alone and it is raining and at night---night%1:28:00:: .
So you sit in the car---car%1:06:00:: and listen to the air---air%1:27:00:: run out and listen to the rain---rain%1:19:00:: and see the mud---mud%1:27:00:: in front of the headlights---headlight%1:06:00:: , waiting for you , for your new spectator pumps---spectator_pump%1:06:00:: , waiting for you to squat by yourself out there in your tight skirt---skirt%1:06:00:: , crying and afraid and trying to get that damned son-of-a-bitch---son_of_a_bitch%1:18:00:: tire---tire%1:06:00:: off , because that is being an old maid---old_maid%1:18:00:: too , if you happen to drive a car---car%1:06:00:: , it is changing the tire---tire%1:06:00:: yourself in the night---night%1:28:00:: , and in the mud---mud%1:27:00:: and the rain---rain%1:19:00:: , hating to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help---help%1:04:00:: .
And every sound---sound%1:09:00:: that might be the rain---rain%1:19:00:: also might be the man---man%1:18:00:: who thinks after he has raped you he has to beat your brains---brain%1:08:00:: out with a tire tool---tire_tool%1:06:00:: so you won n't tell , a combination---combination%1:14:00:: like ham and eggs---ham_and_eggs%1:13:00:: , rape her and kill her , and that is being an old maid---old_maid%1:18:00:: too .
It is not having his baby---baby%1:18:00:: nestled warm and fat against your breast---breast%1:08:00:: and it is not having somebody that really gives a damn whether some tramp---tramp%1:18:00:: cracks your skull---skull%1:08:00:: .
And most of all it is not having the only man---man%1:18:00:: you could love , whether he drives a bread---bread%1:13:00:: truck---truck%1:06:00:: or delivers the mail---mail%1:10:01:: or checks the berry---berry%1:13:00:: crates---crate%1:06:00:: down at the sheds---shed%1:06:00:: , or owns seventeen oil wells---oil_well%1:06:00:: and six diamond---diamond%1:27:00:: mines---mine%1:06:01:: , for if you are anybody what he is or does makes no difference---difference%1:07:00:: if he is the one .
He can even be a mild voiced little town---town%1:15:00:: guy---guy%1:18:00:: with big town---town%1:15:00:: ideas---idea%1:09:00:: and level gray eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and a heart---heart%1:09:00:: even Houdini---person%1:03:00:: could n't figure out , how it is unlocked .
And he can be on the way to Memphis---memphis%1:15:00:: , your Gratt Shafer---person%1:03:00:: can , and you discover you can stay alive and hate him and love him and want him even if it means you want him - really want him - dead .
For you do n't share him , not even with God---god%1:18:00:: .
If it is love---love%1:12:00:: , you do n't .
If it is love---love%1:12:01:: , you do n't .
Even if that 's all the promise---promise%1:10:00:: he ever gave or ever will give , the giving---giving%1:04:00:: of it once was enough and you believed it then and you will always believe it , even when it is finally the only thing---thing%1:10:00:: in the world---world%1:17:01:: you have left to believe , and the whole world is telling you that one was a lie---lie%1:10:00:: .
Even when he is on the way to Memphis---memphis%1:15:00:: you will still have the promise---promise%1:10:00:: resting inside you like a gift---gift%1:21:00:: , and it is he inside of you .
And in a way the promise---promise%1:10:00:: works out true , for whether he wants you or not , you go with him in your heart---heart%1:09:00:: .
You feel him every mile---mile%1:23:01:: further away .
You feel where he is and what he sees , and at night---night%1:28:00:: you feel when he is asleep or with the other woman---woman%1:18:00:: , the one that never could love him the way---way%1:07:01:: you do , the one who got him because she did n't particularly give a damn whether she got him or did n't .
And you know you will always wonder all of your life---life%1:28:02:: whether it was because you wanted him so bad that you did n't get him , and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy---guy%1:18:00:: , the chump---chump%1:18:00:: who begged you to marry him , the one with the plastered hair---hair%1:08:00:: and the car---car%1:06:00:: he could n't afford and the too shiny shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: .
You think : `` Did he feel that way---way%1:26:00:: about me '' ?
It comes to you that probably he did feel that way---way%1:26:00:: to let you use him like you did when you could n't have Gratt Shafer---person%1:03:00:: ; that he must have since he was there like the radio---radio%1:06:01:: for you to turn on or snap off when you got tired of him , that other guy---guy%1:18:00:: .
It dawns on you that instead of a lump---lump%1:18:00:: to fill the seat---seat%1:15:01:: across the bridge---bridge%1:04:00:: table---table%1:06:01:: from you , he was a man---man%1:18:00:: , and that because Gratt Shafer---person%1:03:00:: was making you miserable , you were passing it down to him , to Gratt Shafer---person%1:03:00:: 's substitute---substitute%1:09:00:: , that other guy---guy%1:18:00:: .
And you wonder if that is why the little man---man%1:18:00:: lost his job---job%1:04:00:: and his car---car%1:06:00:: and stayed drunk about a year---year%1:28:01:: before he straightened out and moved to St. Louis---st._louis%1:15:00:: , where he got to be a big unhappy success---success%1:18:00:: .
You wonder if he looks at his wife---wife%1:18:00:: now and thinks of you .
You wonder about the Christmas card---christmas_card%1:10:00:: with no name---name%1:10:00:: on it , and it comes to you that maybe it would have been better to have made somebody else happy if you could n't be happy yourself , to give somebody else the one they wanted - to give them you .
`` Damn the world---world%1:17:01:: '' , she thought .
She looked out at the corn---corn%1:20:00:: field---field%1:15:00:: , the great green deep acres---acre%1:23:00:: of it rolled out like the sea---sea%1:17:00:: in the field---field%1:15:00:: beyond the whitewashed fence---fence%1:06:00:: bordering the grounds---grounds%1:15:00:: .
The mayor---mayor%1:18:00:: envisioned factories---factory%1:06:00:: there .
Homes---home%1:06:00:: and factories---factory%1:06:00:: and schools---school%1:06:00:: and a big wide federal highway---highway%1:06:00:: , instead of peaceful corn---corn%1:20:00:: to rest your eyes---eye%1:08:00:: on while you tried to rest your heart---heart%1:09:00:: , while you tried not to look at the balloon---balloon%1:06:00:: and the bandstand---bandstand%1:06:00:: and the uniforms---uniform%1:06:00:: and the flash---flash%1:07:00:: of the instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: .
The bands---band%1:14:00:: were impatient , but they were the only ones .
The others , the ones in the stands , were spellbound , for hearing the mayor---mayor%1:18:00:: was for them like listening to a symphony---symphony%1:14:00:: was for sophisticated folks---folk%1:14:00:: in New York City---new_york_city%1:15:00:: .
The others , the ones in the stands , were spellbound , for hearing the mayor was for them like listening to a symphony---symphony%1:10:00:: was for sophisticated folks in New York City .
It was like being in the concert hall---concert_hall%1:06:00:: in the afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: and hearing the piano---piano%1:06:00:: virtuoso---virtuoso%1:18:00:: rehearsing .
He was good and they knew that what he was doing for them he would do all over the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: some day .
If a man---man%1:18:04:: was good , if he was going to be governor---governor%1:18:00:: , you felt it and you wanted him to go on forever .
You were sorry when he finished talking because while he was up there you were someone else and the world---world%1:17:01:: was something else too .
It was a place---place%1:15:04:: full of courage---courage%1:07:00:: and hope---hope%1:12:00:: and you were part---part%1:24:00:: of it .
You laughed and then your chest---chest%1:08:00:: swelled and you felt you could cry for a little bit---bit%1:28:00:: , and then a feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: hit you like a chill---chill%1:12:02:: in your stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: and the goose bumps rippled along your arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
He hit the theme---theme%1:10:00:: about dying to defend your country---country%1:14:00:: , and you were ready to do it right then , without a second thought---second_thought%1:09:00:: .
While he talked you would n't trade being a West Tennessee---location%1:03:00:: farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: for being anything else in the whole damned world---world%1:17:01:: , no matter if it had n't , in six weeks---week%1:28:00:: , rained enough to wet a rat 's ass .
She glanced at the man---man%1:18:00:: nodding beside her , a man---man%1:18:00:: with weather---weather%1:19:00:: cracks---crack%1:25:00:: furrowed into his lean cheeks---cheek%1:08:00:: , with powdery pale eyes---eye%1:08:00:: reflecting all the droughts---drought%1:26:00:: he had seen , reflecting the sky---sky%1:17:00:: and the drought---drought%1:26:00:: which must follow now in August---august%1:28:00:: - yes , with eyes---eye%1:08:00:: predicting the drought---drought%1:26:00:: and here it was only June---june%1:28:00:: , only festival---festival%1:28:00:: time---time%1:28:00:: again and thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: of Gratt Shafer---person%1:03:00:: would not leave her .
`` I should have stayed at the store---store%1:06:00:: '' , she thought .
Back at the Factory-to-You---group%1:03:00:: with the other old maids---old_maid%1:18:00:: , back there she was the youngest clerk---clerk%1:18:01:: and she was thirty-four , which made her young enough to resent the usual ideal working conditions---condition%1:26:00:: , like the unventilated toilet---toilet%1:06:00:: with the door---door%1:06:00:: you had to hold shut while you sat down .
There was no lock---lock%1:06:00:: because Herman---person%1:03:00:: did n't allow a lock---lock%1:06:00:: .
A lock---lock%1:06:00:: on the toilet---toilet%1:06:00:: would encourage malingering---malingering%1:04:00:: and primping---primping%1:04:00:: .
The toilet---toilet%1:06:00:: had n't had a sincere scrubbing---scrubbing%1:04:00:: in years---years%1:28:01:: and there were things---thing%1:10:00:: written on the walls---wall%1:06:00:: of the little boxed in place---place%1:15:04:: because you could n't keep the public---public%1:14:00:: out - entirely .
She could not count the times---time%1:11:00:: Herman---person%1:03:00:: had rapped on the door---door%1:06:00:: , just a couple of bangs---bang%1:11:01:: that shook the whole damned closet---closet%1:06:01:: and might , someday , break away the pipe---pipe%1:06:00:: connections---connection%1:06:00:: from the wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
The two little bangs---bang%1:11:01:: meant that he was getting impatient to have a crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: of customers---customer%1:18:00:: waited on and that if he had to he would jerk open the door---door%1:06:00:: and drag out , by the opposite door handle---doorhandle%1:06:00:: which she would be clutching , whichever-the-hell clerk---clerk%1:18:01:: it was who thought she could waste so much store---store%1:06:00:: time---time%1:28:05:: on the pot---pot%1:06:01:: .
And the hours---hours%1:28:00:: were six-thirty in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: until eleven at night---night%1:28:00:: on Saturdays---saturday%1:28:00:: and during sales---sale%1:04:01:: , and there were no chairs---chair%1:06:00:: and you could n't smoke and the cooling---cooling%1:06:00:: was overhead fans---fan%1:06:00:: and there was no porter---porter%1:18:00:: or janitor---janitor%1:18:00:: .
It would have been desirable for the two communities---community%1:14:00:: to have differed only in respect---respect%1:09:00:: to the variable---variable%1:17:00:: being investigated : the degree---degree%1:07:00:: of structure---structure%1:09:00:: in teaching method---teaching_method%1:09:00:: .
The structured schools---school%1:14:00:: were in an industrial city---city%1:15:00:: , with three family---family%1:14:02:: tenement houses---tenement_house%1:06:00:: typical of the residential areas---area%1:15:01:: , but with one rather sizable section---section%1:15:01:: of middle-class homes---home%1:06:00:: .
The unstructured schools---school%1:14:00:: were in a large suburban community---community%1:14:00:: , predominantly middle - to upper-middle class , but fringed by an industrial area---area%1:15:01:: .
In order to equate the samples---sample%1:09:01:: on socioeconomic status---status%1:26:00:: , we chose schools---school%1:14:00:: in both cities---city%1:15:00:: on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of socioeconomic status---status%1:26:00:: of the neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:15:00:: .
School principals---school_principal%1:18:00:: and guidance---guidance%1:10:00:: workers---worker%1:18:00:: made ratings---rating%1:04:00:: of the various neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:15:00:: and the research---research%1:04:00:: team---team%1:14:00:: made independent observations---observation%1:04:01:: of houses---house%1:06:00:: and dwelling---dwelling%1:06:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: .
An objective scale---scale%1:24:03:: was developed for rating school---school%1:14:00:: neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:15:00:: from these data---data%1:14:00:: .
Equal proportions---proportion%1:24:00:: of children---child%1:18:00:: in each city---city%1:15:00:: were drawn from upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:15:00:: .
Individual differences---difference%1:07:00:: in maturation---maturation%1:22:00:: and the development---development%1:22:02:: of readiness---readiness%1:26:00:: for learning to read indicate that not until the third grade---grade%1:14:00:: have most children---child%1:18:00:: had ample opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to demonstrate their capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: for school---school%1:09:00:: achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: .
Therefore , third grade---grade%1:14:00:: children---child%1:18:00:: were chosen as subjects---subject%1:18:01:: for this study---study%1:04:00:: .
For purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: of sample---sample%1:09:01:: selection---selection%1:04:00:: only ( individual tests---test%1:04:02:: were given later ) we obtained group---group%1:03:00:: test---test%1:04:02:: scores---score%1:09:00:: of reading---reading%1:09:00:: achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: and intelligence---intelligence%1:09:00:: from school---school%1:14:00:: records---record%1:10:03:: of the entire third grade---grade%1:14:00:: population---population%1:14:00:: in each school system---school_system%1:06:00:: .
The subjects---subject%1:18:01:: for this study---study%1:04:00:: were randomly selected from stratified areas---area%1:15:01:: of the distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: , one-third---one-third%1:23:00:: as underachievers---underachiever%1:18:00:: , one-third---one-third%1:23:00:: medium , and one-third---one-third%1:23:00:: over-achievers---overachiever%1:18:00:: .
Children---child%1:18:00:: whose reading---reading%1:09:00:: scores---score%1:09:00:: were at least one standard deviation---standard_deviation%1:09:00:: below the regression line---regression_line%1:09:00:: of each total third grade---grade%1:14:00:: school---school%1:14:00:: population---population%1:14:00:: were considered under-achievers---underachiever%1:18:00:: for the purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: of sample---sample%1:09:01:: selection---selection%1:04:00:: .
Over-achievers---overachiever%1:18:00:: were at least one standard deviation---standard_deviation%1:09:00:: above the regression line---regression_line%1:09:00:: in their school system---school_system%1:06:00:: .
The final sample---sample%1:09:01:: was not significantly different from a normal distribution---normal_distribution%1:09:00:: in regard to reading---reading%1:09:00:: achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: or intelligence test---intelligence_test%1:04:00:: scores---score%1:09:00:: .
Twenty-four classrooms---classroom%1:06:00:: in twelve unstructured schools---school%1:14:00:: furnished 156 cases---case%1:18:02:: , 87 boys---boy%1:18:00:: and 69 girls---girl%1:18:02:: .
Eight classrooms---classroom%1:06:00:: in three structured schools---school%1:14:00:: furnished 72 cases---case%1:18:02:: , 36 boys---boy%1:18:00:: and 36 girls---girl%1:18:02:: .
Administrative restrictions---restriction%1:09:00:: necessitated the smaller sample---sample%1:09:01:: size---size%1:07:00:: in the structured schools---school%1:14:00:: .
It was assumed that the sampling---sampling%1:04:00:: procedure---procedure%1:04:02:: was purely random with respect to the personality---personality%1:07:00:: variables---variable%1:17:00:: under investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: .
An interview---interview%1:10:01:: schedule---schedule%1:10:00:: of open-ended questions---question%1:10:00:: and a multiple-choice questionnaire---questionnaire%1:10:00:: were prepared , and one parent---parent%1:18:00:: of each of the sample---sample%1:09:01:: children---child%1:18:00:: was seen in the home---home%1:15:04:: .
The parent---parent%1:18:00:: was asked to describe the child---child%1:18:00:: 's typical behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: in certain standard situations---situation%1:26:01:: in which there was an opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to observe tendencies---tendency%1:09:00:: toward perfectionism---perfectionism%1:07:00:: in demands---demand%1:10:00:: upon self---self%1:18:00:: and others , irrational conformity---conformity%1:04:00:: to rules---rule%1:09:00:: , orderliness---orderliness%1:07:00:: , punctuality---punctuality%1:07:00:: , and need---need%1:26:00:: for certainty---certainty%1:09:00:: .
The interviewers---interviewer%1:18:00:: were instructed not to suggest answers---answer%1:10:01:: and , as much as possible , to record the parents---parent%1:18:00:: ' actual words---words%1:10:03:: as they described the child---child%1:18:00:: 's behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: in home---home%1:15:04:: situations---situation%1:26:01:: .
The rating---rating%1:04:00:: scale---scale%1:24:03:: of compulsivity---compulsivity%1:07:00:: was constructed by first perusing the interview---interview%1:10:01:: records---record%1:10:03:: , categorizing all evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: related to compulsivity---compulsivity%1:07:00:: , then arranging a distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: of such information---information%1:09:00:: apart from the case---case%1:18:02:: records---record%1:10:03:: .
Final ratings---rating%1:04:00:: were made on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of a point system---point_system%1:09:00:: which was developed after studying the distributions---distribution%1:09:00:: of actual behaviors---behavior%1:04:00:: recorded and assigning weight---weight%1:07:01:: values---value%1:09:00:: to each type---type%1:09:00:: of behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: that was deviant from the discovered norms---norm%1:09:00:: .
Children---child%1:18:00:: scoring high in compulsivity---compulsivity%1:07:00:: were those who gave evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: of tension---tension%1:26:03:: or emotionality---emotionality%1:07:00:: in situations---situation%1:26:01:: where there was lack---lack%1:26:00:: of organization---organization%1:09:00:: or conformity---conformity%1:04:00:: to standards---standard%1:09:00:: and expectations---expectation%1:09:00:: , or who made exaggerated efforts---effort%1:04:00:: to achieve these goals---goal%1:09:00:: .
The low compulsive child---child%1:18:00:: was one who appeared relatively unconcerned about such matters---matter%1:09:01:: .
For instance , the following statement---statement%1:10:00:: was rated low in compulsivity---compulsivity%1:07:00:: , `` She 's naturally quite neat about things---thing%1:09:02:: , but it does n't bother her at all if her room---room%1:06:00:: gets messy .
Castaneda---person%1:03:00:: , et al. revised the Taylor Anxiety Scale for use---use%1:04:00:: with children---child%1:18:00:: .
The Taylor Scale was adapted from the Minnesota Multiphastic Personality Inventory , with item---item%1:06:00:: selection---selection%1:04:00:: based upon clinical definitions---definition%1:10:00:: of anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: .
There is much research---research%1:04:00:: evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: to validate the use---use%1:04:00:: of the instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: in differentiating individuals---individual%1:03:00:: who are likely to manifest anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: in varying degrees---degree%1:07:00:: .
Reliability---reliability%1:07:00:: and validation---validation%1:04:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: with the Children 's Anxiety Scale by Castaneda---person%1:03:00:: , et al. demonstrated results---result%1:19:00:: closely similar to the findings---finding%1:04:00:: with the adult---adult%1:18:00:: scale---scale%1:24:03:: .
Although the Taylor Scale was designed as a group---group%1:03:00:: testing---testing%1:04:03:: device---device%1:06:00:: , in this study---study%1:04:00:: it was individually administered by psychologically trained workers---worker%1:18:00:: who established rapport---rapport%1:24:00:: and assisted the children---child%1:18:00:: in reading the items---item%1:06:00:: .
The question---question%1:10:00:: may be raised whether or not we are dealing with a common factor---factor%1:09:00:: in anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: and compulsivity---compulsivity%1:07:00:: .
The two ratings---rating%1:09:00:: yield a correlation---correlation%1:09:00:: of + .04 , which is not significantly different from zero ; therefore , we have measured two different characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: .
In theory , compulsive behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: is a way---way%1:04:01:: of diminishing anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: , and one might expect a negative association---association%1:26:02:: except for the possibility---possibility%1:09:00:: that for many children---child%1:18:00:: the obsessive-compulsive defenses---defense%1:22:00:: are not sufficient to quell the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: they suffer .
The issue---issue%1:09:01:: of interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: between anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: and compulsivity---compulsivity%1:07:00:: will be taken up later .
In the primary grades---grade%1:14:00:: , reading---reading%1:09:00:: permeates almost every aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: of school---school%1:09:00:: progress---progress%1:04:01:: , and the children---child%1:18:00:: 's early experiences---experience%1:11:00:: of success---success%1:04:00:: or failure---failure%1:04:00:: in learning to read often set a pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: of total achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: that is relatively enduring throughout the following years---year%1:28:01:: .
In establishing criterion---criterion%1:10:00:: measurements , it was therefore thought best to broaden the scope---scope%1:07:00:: beyond the reading---reading%1:09:00:: act---act%1:03:00:: itself .
The predicted interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: effect---effect%1:19:00:: should , if potent , extend its influence---influence%1:07:00:: over all academic achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: .
The Stanford Achievement Test , Form J , was administered by classroom---classroom%1:06:00:: teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: , consisting of a battery---battery%1:14:01:: of six sub tests---sub-test%1:04:00:: : Paragraph---paragraph%1:10:00:: Meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: , Word---word%1:10:00:: Meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: , Spelling---spelling%1:10:00:: , Language---language%1:10:00:: , Arithmetic---arithmetic%1:09:00:: Computation---computation%1:04:00:: , and Arithmetic---arithmetic%1:09:00:: Reasoning---reasoning%1:09:00:: .
All of these sub-tests---sub-test%1:04:00:: involve reading---reading%1:09:00:: except Arithmetic---arithmetic%1:09:00:: Computation---computation%1:04:00:: .
Scores---score%1:09:00:: are stated in grade---grade%1:14:00:: equivalents---equivalent%1:09:00:: on a national norm---norm%1:09:00:: .
The battery---battery%1:14:01:: median grade---grade%1:14:00:: equivalent---equivalent%1:09:00:: was used in data---data%1:14:00:: analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: in this study---study%1:04:00:: .
The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was administered to each sample---sample%1:09:01:: third grade---grade%1:14:00:: child---child%1:18:00:: by a clinical worker---worker%1:18:00:: .
The relationship of intelligence test scores to school achievement is a well established fact ( in this case---case%1:11:00:: , * * f ) ; therefore , in the investigation of the present hypothesis , it was necessary to control this factor .
The relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: of intelligence test---intelligence_test%1:04:00:: scores---score%1:09:00:: to school---school%1:09:00:: achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: is a well established fact---fact%1:09:01:: ( in this case---case%1:26:00:: , * * f ) ; therefore , in the investigation---investigation%1:04:00:: of the present hypothesis---hypothesis%1:10:00:: , it was necessary to control this factor---factor%1:09:00:: .
The criterion---criterion%1:10:00:: score---score%1:09:00:: used in the statistical analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: is an index---index%1:24:00:: of over---overachievement%1:04:00:: - or under-achievement---underachievement%1:04:00:: .
It is the discrepancy---discrepancy%1:11:00:: between the actual attained achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: test---test%1:04:02:: score---score%1:09:00:: and the score---score%1:09:00:: that would be predicted by the I. Q.---i.q.%1:24:00:: .
For example , on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of the regression equation---regression_equation%1:09:00:: , a child---child%1:18:00:: with an I. Q.---i.q.%1:24:00:: of 120 in this sample---sample%1:09:01:: would be expected to earn an achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: test---test%1:04:02:: score---score%1:09:00:: of 4.8 ( grade---grade%1:14:00:: equivalent---equivalent%1:09:00:: ) .
If a child---child%1:18:00:: with an I. Q.---i.q.%1:24:00:: of 120 scored 5.5 in achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: , his discrepancy---discrepancy%1:11:00:: score---score%1:09:00:: would be + .7 , representing .7 of one year---year%1:28:01:: of over-achievement---overachievement%1:04:00:: .
A child---child%1:18:00:: with an I. Q.---i.q.%1:24:00:: of 98 would be expected to earn an achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: test---test%1:04:02:: score---score%1:09:00:: of 3.5 .
If such a child---child%1:18:00:: scored 3.0 , his discrepancy---discrepancy%1:11:00:: score---score%1:09:00:: would be - .5 , representing .5 of one year---year%1:28:01:: of under-achievement---underachievement%1:04:00:: .
In this manner---manner%1:07:02:: , the factors---factor%1:09:00:: measured by the intelligence test---intelligence_test%1:04:00:: were controlled , allowing discovered differences---difference%1:07:00:: in achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: to be interpreted as resulting from other variables---variable%1:17:00:: .
Tables---table%1:14:00:: 1 and 2 present the results---result%1:19:00:: of the statistical analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of the data---data%1:14:00:: when compulsivity---compulsivity%1:07:00:: is used as the descriptive variable---variable%1:17:00:: .
Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 1 portrays the mean achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: scores---score%1:09:00:: of each sub-group---subgroup%1:14:00:: graphically .
First of all , as we had surmised , the highly compulsive children---child%1:18:00:: in the structured setting---setting%1:15:00:: score significantly better ( * * f ) on achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: than do similar children---child%1:18:00:: in the unstructured schools---school%1:14:00:: .
It can be seen too that when we contrast levels---level%1:07:00:: of compulsivity---compulsivity%1:07:00:: within the structured schools---school%1:14:00:: , the high compulsive children---child%1:18:00:: do better ( * * f ) .
No significant difference---difference%1:07:00:: was found in achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: between high and low compulsive children---child%1:18:00:: within the unstructured school---school%1:14:00:: .
The hypothesis of there being an interaction between compulsivity and teaching method was supported , in this case---case%1:11:00:: , at the .05 level .
The hypothesis---hypothesis%1:10:00:: of there being an interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: between compulsivity---compulsivity%1:07:00:: and teaching method---teaching_method%1:09:00:: was supported , in this case---case%1:26:00:: , at the .05 level---level%1:07:00:: .
While we had expected that compulsive children---child%1:18:00:: in the unstructured school---school%1:14:00:: setting---setting%1:15:00:: would have difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: when compared to those in the structured , we were surprised to find that the achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: of the high compulsives---compulsive%1:18:00:: within the schools---school%1:14:00:: where the whole-word method---whole-word_method%1:04:00:: is used in beginning reading---reading%1:09:00:: compares favorably with that of the low compulsives---compulsive%1:18:00:: .
Indeed their achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: scores---score%1:09:00:: were somewhat better on an absolute basis---basis%1:24:00:: although the difference---difference%1:07:00:: was not significant .
We speculate that compulsives---compulsive%1:18:00:: in the unstructured schools---school%1:14:00:: are under greater strain---strain%1:26:02:: because of the lack---lack%1:26:00:: of systemization---systematization%1:04:00:: in their school---school%1:14:00:: setting---setting%1:15:00:: , but that their need---need%1:26:00:: to organize ( for comfort---comfort%1:12:00:: ) is so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rules---rule%1:09:03:: and achieve in spite of the lack---lack%1:26:00:: of direction---direction%1:10:00:: from the environment---environment%1:26:00:: .
It is interesting to note that medium compulsives---compulsive%1:18:00:: in the unstructured schools---school%1:14:00:: made the lowest achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: scores---score%1:09:00:: ( although not significantly lower ) .
Possibly their compulsivity---compulsivity%1:07:00:: was not strong enough to cause them to build their own structure---structure%1:09:00:: .
Our conjecture---conjecture%1:09:00:: is , then , that regardless of the manner---manner%1:07:02:: in which school---school%1:14:00:: lessons---lesson%1:04:01:: are taught , the compulsive child---child%1:18:00:: accentuates those elements---element%1:09:00:: of each lesson---lesson%1:04:01:: that aid him in systematizing his work---work%1:04:00:: .
When helped by a high degree---degree%1:07:00:: of structure---structure%1:09:00:: in lesson---lesson%1:04:01:: presentation---presentation%1:04:01:: , then , and only then , does such a child---child%1:18:00:: attain unusual success---success%1:04:00:: .
The statistical analyses---analysis%1:04:00:: of achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: in relation to anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: and teaching methods---teaching_method%1:09:00:: and the interactions---interaction%1:04:00:: of the two are presented in Tables---table%1:14:00:: 3---3%1:23:00:: and 4---4%1:23:00:: .
Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 is a graph---graph%1:10:00:: of the mean achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: scores---score%1:09:00:: of each group---group%1:03:00:: .
As predicted , the highly anxious children---child%1:18:00:: in the unstructured schools---school%1:14:00:: score more poorly ( * * f ) than those in the structured schools---school%1:14:00:: .
The interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: effect---effect%1:19:00:: , which is significant at the .01 level---level%1:07:00:: , can be seen best in the contrast---contrast%1:04:00:: of mean scores---score%1:09:00:: .
While high anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: children---child%1:18:00:: achieve significantly less well ( * * f ) in the unstructured school---school%1:14:00:: than do low anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: children---child%1:18:00:: , they appear to do at least as well as the average---average%1:09:00:: in the structured classroom---classroom%1:06:00:: .
The most striking aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: of the interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: demonstrated is the marked decrement---decrement%1:07:00:: in performance suffered by the highly anxious children---child%1:18:00:: in unstructured schools---school%1:14:00:: .
According to the theory---theory%1:09:01:: proposed , this is a consequence---consequence%1:19:00:: of the severe condition---condition%1:26:00:: of perceived threat---threat%1:26:00:: that persists unabated for the anxious child---child%1:18:00:: in an ambiguous sort---sort%1:09:00:: of school---school%1:14:00:: environment---environment%1:26:00:: .
The fact---fact%1:10:01:: that such threat---threat%1:26:00:: is potent in the beginning reading---reading%1:09:00:: lessons---lesson%1:04:01:: is thought to be a vital factor---factor%1:09:00:: in the continued pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: of failure---failure%1:04:00:: or under-achievement---underachievement%1:04:00:: these children---child%1:18:00:: exhibit .
The child---child%1:18:00:: with high anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: may first direct his anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: released energy---energy%1:07:02:: toward achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: , but because his distress severely reduces the abilities---ability%1:09:00:: of discrimination---discrimination%1:09:00:: and memorization---memorization%1:09:00:: of complex symbols---symbol%1:10:00:: , the child---child%1:18:00:: may fail in his initial attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: to master the problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
Failure---failure%1:04:00:: confirms the threat---threat%1:26:00:: , and the intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: of anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: is increased as the required learning---learning%1:09:00:: becomes more difficult , so that by the time---time%1:28:06:: the child---child%1:18:00:: reaches the third grade---grade%1:14:00:: the decrement---decrement%1:07:00:: in performance is pronounced .
The individual---individual%1:03:00:: with high anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: in the structured classroom---classroom%1:06:00:: may approach the learning---learning%1:09:00:: task---task%1:04:01:: with the same increased energy---energy%1:07:02:: and lowered powers---power%1:09:01:: of discrimination---discrimination%1:09:00:: .
But the symbols---symbol%1:10:00:: he is asked to learn are simple .
As shown earlier , the highly anxious individual---individual%1:03:00:: may be superior in his memorizing of simple elements---element%1:09:00:: .
Success---success%1:04:00:: reduces the prospect---prospect%1:09:01:: of threat---threat%1:26:00:: and his powers---power%1:09:01:: of discrimination---discrimination%1:09:00:: are improved .
By the time---time%1:28:06:: the child---child%1:18:00:: first attacks the actual problem---problem%1:26:00:: of reading---reading%1:09:00:: , he is completely familiar and at ease with all of the elements---element%1:09:00:: of words---word%1:10:00:: .
Apparently academic challenge---challenge%1:26:00:: in the structured setting---setting%1:15:00:: creates an optimum---optimum%1:07:00:: of stress---stress%1:26:01:: so that the child---child%1:18:00:: with high anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: is able to achieve because he is aroused to an energetic state---state%1:03:00:: without becoming confused or panicked .
Sarason---person%1:03:00:: et al. present evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that the anxious child---child%1:18:00:: will suffer in the test---test%1:04:02:: like situation---situation%1:26:01:: , and that his performance will be impaired unless he receives supporting and accepting treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: from the teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: .
Although the present study---study%1:04:00:: was not a direct replication---replication%1:04:00:: of their investigations---investigation%1:04:00:: , the results---result%1:19:00:: do not confirm their conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: .
Observers---observer%1:18:01:: , in the two school systems---school_system%1:06:00:: studied here , judged the teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: in the structured schools---school%1:14:00:: to be more impersonal and demanding , while the atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: in the unstructured schools---school%1:14:00:: was judged to be more supporting and accepting .
Yet the highly anxious child---child%1:18:00:: suffered a tremendous disadvantage---disadvantage%1:07:00:: only in the unstructured school---school%1:14:00:: , and performed as well or better than average in the structured setting---setting%1:15:00:: .
The late R. G. Collingwood---person%1:03:00:: , a philosopher---philosopher%1:18:00:: whose work---work%1:06:00:: has proved helpful to many students---student%1:18:01:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: , once wrote `` We are all , though many of us are snobbish enough to wish to deny it , in far closer sympathy---sympathy%1:24:00:: with the art---art%1:06:00:: of the music-hall---music_hall%1:06:00:: and picture-palace---picture_palace%1:06:00:: than with Chaucer---person%1:03:00:: and Cimabue---person%1:03:00:: , or even Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: and Titian---person%1:03:00:: .
By an effort---effort%1:04:00:: of historical sympathy---sympathy%1:09:00:: we can cast our minds---mind%1:09:00:: back into the art---art%1:06:00:: of a remote past---past%1:28:00:: or an alien present---present%1:28:00:: , and enjoy the carvings---carving%1:06:00:: of cavemen---caveman%1:18:00:: and Japanese colour prints---print%1:06:00:: ; but the possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: of this effort---effort%1:04:00:: is bound up with that development---development%1:22:02:: of historical thought---thought%1:09:00:: which is the greatest achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: of our civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: in the last two centuries---century%1:28:00:: , and it is utterly impossible to people---people%1:14:00:: in whom this development---development%1:22:02:: has not taken place .
The natural and primary aesthetic attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: is to enjoy contemporary art---art%1:06:00:: , to despise and dislike the art---art%1:06:00:: of the recent past---past%1:28:00:: , and wholly to ignore everything else '' .
One might argue that the ultimate purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of literary scholarship---scholarship%1:09:00:: is to correct this spontaneous provincialism---provincialism%1:09:01:: that is likely to obscure the horizons---horizon%1:07:00:: of the general public---public%1:14:00:: , of the newspaper critic---newspaper_critic%1:18:00:: , and of the creative artist---artist%1:18:00:: himself .
There results a study---study%1:04:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: freed from the tyranny---tyranny%1:14:00:: of the contemporary .
Such study---study%1:09:04:: may take many forms---form%1:09:00:: .
The study---study%1:04:00:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: in literature---literature%1:10:00:: is one of these .
Of course , it goes without saying that no student---student%1:18:01:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene---scene%1:26:00:: .
The continuities---continuity%1:26:00:: , contrasts---contrast%1:24:00:: , and similarities---similarity%1:07:00:: discernible when past---past%1:28:00:: and present---present%1:28:00:: are surveyed together are inexhaustible and the one is often understood through the other .
When we assert the value---value%1:07:00:: of such study---study%1:09:04:: , we find ourselves committed to an important assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: .
Most students---student%1:18:01:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: , whether they call themselves scholars---scholar%1:18:00:: or critics---critic%1:18:00:: , are ready to argue that it is possible to understand literary works---literary_work%1:10:00:: as well as to enjoy them .
Many will add that we may find our enjoyment---enjoyment%1:12:00:: heightened by our understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: .
This understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: , of course , may in its turn take many forms---form%1:09:00:: and some of these - especially those most interesting to the student---student%1:18:01:: of comparative literature---comparative_literature%1:09:00:: - are essentially historical .
But the historian---historian%1:18:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: need not confine his attention---attention%1:09:00:: to biography---biography%1:10:00:: or to stylistic questions---question%1:10:01:: of form---form%1:10:02:: , `` texture---texture%1:09:00:: '' , or technique---technique%1:09:00:: .
He may also consider ideas---idea%1:09:00:: .
It is true that this distinction---distinction%1:09:00:: between style---style%1:10:00:: and idea---idea%1:09:00:: often approaches the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style---style%1:10:00:: and content---content%1:10:00:: frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear as expressions---expression%1:10:02:: of the same insight---insight%1:09:02:: .
But , in general , we may argue that the student---student%1:18:01:: can direct the primary emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: of his attention---attention%1:09:00:: toward one or the other .
At this point---point%1:28:00:: a working definition---definition%1:10:00:: of idea---idea%1:09:00:: is in order , although our first definition---definition%1:10:00:: will have to be qualified somewhat as we proceed .
The term---term%1:10:00:: idea---idea%1:09:00:: refers to our more reflective or thoughtful consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: as opposed to the immediacies---immediacy%1:09:00:: of sensuous or emotional experience---experience%1:11:00:: .
It is through such reflection---reflection%1:09:00:: that literature---literature%1:09:00:: approaches philosophy---philosophy%1:09:00:: .
An idea---idea%1:09:00:: , let us say , may be roughly defined as a theme---theme%1:09:01:: or topic---topic%1:10:00:: with which our reflection---reflection%1:09:00:: may be concerned .
In this essay---essay%1:10:00:: , we are , along with most historians---historian%1:18:00:: , interested in the more general or more inclusive ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , that are so to speak `` writ large '' in history---history%1:10:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: where they recur continually .
Outstanding among these is the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of human nature---nature%1:07:02:: itself , including the many definitions---definition%1:10:00:: that have been advanced over the centuries---century%1:28:00:: ; also secondary notions---notion%1:09:00:: such as the perfectibility---perfectibility%1:09:00:: of man , the depravity---depravity%1:07:00:: of man , and the dignity---dignity%1:07:00:: of man .
One might , indeed , argue that the history---history%1:10:00:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , in so far as it includes the literatures---literature%1:10:00:: , must center on characterizations---characterization%1:10:00:: of human nature---nature%1:07:02:: and that the great periods---period%1:28:00:: of literary achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: may be distinguished from one another by reference---reference%1:04:00:: to the images---image%1:09:00:: of human nature---nature%1:07:02:: that they succeed in fashioning .
We need not , to be sure , expect to find such ideas---idea%1:09:00:: in every piece---piece%1:06:05:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: .
An idea---idea%1:09:00:: , of the sort---sort%1:09:00:: that we have in mind , although of necessity readily available to imagination---imagination%1:09:02:: , is more general in connotation---connotation%1:09:00:: than most poetic or literary images---image%1:09:00:: , especially those appearing in lyric poems---lyric_poem%1:10:00:: that seek to capture a moment---moment%1:28:00:: of personal experience---experience%1:11:00:: .
Thus Burns---person%1:03:00:: 's `` My love---love%1:18:00:: is like a red , red rose---rose%1:20:00:: '' and Hopkins---person%1:03:00:: ' `` The thunder-purple sea---sea%1:17:00:: beach---beach%1:17:00:: , plumed purple---purple%1:07:00:: of thunder---thunder%1:11:01:: '' although clearly intelligible in content---content%1:10:00:: , hardly present ideas---idea%1:09:00:: of the sort---sort%1:09:00:: with which we are here concerned .
On the other hand , Arnold---person%1:03:00:: 's `` The unplumbed , salt , estranging sea---sea%1:17:00:: '' , taken in its context---context%1:10:00:: , certainly does so .
Understanding a work of art---work_of_art%1:06:00:: involves recognition---recognition%1:26:00:: of the ideas---idea%1:09:00:: that it reflects or embodies .
Thus the student---student%1:18:01:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem---poem%1:10:00:: or an essay---essay%1:10:00:: as being in idea---idea%1:09:00:: or in ideal content---content%1:10:00:: or subject matter---subject_matter%1:10:00:: typical or atypical of its period---period%1:28:00:: .
Again , he may discover embodied within its texture---texture%1:09:00:: a theme---theme%1:09:01:: or idea---idea%1:09:00:: that has been presented elsewhere and at other times---time%1:28:00:: in various ways---way%1:07:01:: .
Our understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: will very probably require both these commentaries---commentary%1:10:00:: .
Very likely it will also include a recognition---recognition%1:26:00:: that the work---work%1:06:00:: we are reading reflects or `` belongs to '' some way---way%1:07:01:: of thought---thought%1:09:02:: labelled as a `` school---school%1:14:02:: '' or an `` - ism---ism%1:09:00:: '' , i. e. a complex---complex%1:09:00:: or `` syndrome---syndrome%1:09:00:: '' of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: occurring together with sufficient prominence---prominence%1:26:00:: to warrant identification---identification%1:04:00:: .
Thus ideas---idea%1:09:00:: like `` grace---grace%1:26:00:: '' , `` salvation---salvation%1:04:00:: '' , and `` providence---providence%1:04:00:: '' cluster together in traditional Christianity---christianity%1:09:00:: .
Usually the work---work%1:06:00:: studied offers us a special or even an individualized rendering---rendering%1:09:00:: or treatment---treatment%1:10:00:: of the ideas---idea%1:09:00:: in question , so that the student---student%1:18:01:: finds it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expressions---expression%1:10:04:: of an `` - ism---ism%1:09:00:: '' or mode---mode%1:07:00:: of thought---thought%1:09:02:: .
Accordingly we may speak of the Platonism---platonism%1:09:00:: peculiar to Shelley---person%1:03:00:: 's poems---poem%1:10:00:: or the type---type%1:09:00:: of Stoicism---stoicism%1:09:00:: present in Henley---person%1:03:00:: 's `` Invictus '' , and we may find that describing such Platonism---platonism%1:09:00:: or such Stoicism---stoicism%1:09:00:: and contrasting each with other expressions---expression%1:10:04:: of the same attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: or mode---mode%1:07:00:: of thought---thought%1:09:02:: is a difficult and challenging enterprise---enterprise%1:04:00:: .
After all , Shelley---person%1:03:00:: is no `` orthodox '' or Hellenic---hellenic%1:10:00:: Platonist---platonist%1:18:00:: , and even his `` romantic '' Platonism---platonism%1:09:00:: can be distinguished from that of his contemporaries---contemporaries%1:14:00:: .
Again , Henley---person%1:03:00:: 's attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of defiance---defiance%1:07:00:: which colors his ideal---ideal%1:09:00:: of self---self%1:18:00:: mastery---mastery%1:26:00:: is far from characteristic of a Stoic---stoic%1:18:01:: thinker---thinker%1:18:00:: like Marcus Aurelius---person%1:03:00:: , whose gentle acquiescence---acquiescence%1:26:00:: is almost Christian , comparable to the patience---patience%1:07:00:: expressed in Milton---person%1:03:00:: 's sonnet---sonnet%1:10:00:: on his own blindness---blindness%1:26:00:: .
In recent years---year%1:28:01:: , we have come increasingly to recognize that ideas---idea%1:09:00:: have a history---history%1:10:00:: and that not the least important chapters---chapter%1:28:00:: of this history---history%1:10:00:: have to do with thematic or conceptual aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: and the arts---art%1:06:00:: , although these aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: should be studied in conjunction with the history---history%1:10:00:: of philosophy---philosophy%1:09:00:: , of religion---religion%1:09:00:: , and of the sciences .
When these fields---field%1:09:00:: are surveyed together , important patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: of relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence---influence%1:04:00:: , a continuity---continuity%1:26:00:: of thought---thought%1:09:02:: and expression---expression%1:10:02:: including many traditions---tradition%1:09:01:: , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact---contact%1:04:02:: with the fine arts---fine_arts%1:09:00:: and even , to some extent---extent%1:26:00:: , with science .
When these fields are surveyed together , important patterns of relationship emerge indicating a vast community of reciprocal influence , a continuity of thought and expression---expression%1:10:04:: including many traditions , primarily literary , religious , and philosophical , but frequently including contact with the fine arts and even , to some extent , with science .
Here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy---philosophy%1:09:00:: of history---history%1:28:02:: is built on the assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: that ideas---idea%1:09:00:: are the primary objectives---objective%1:09:00:: of the historian---historian%1:18:00:: 's research---research%1:09:00:: .
Let us quote once more from R. G. Collingwood---person%1:03:00:: : `` History---history%1:09:00:: is properly concerned with the actions---action%1:04:02:: of human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: .
Regarded from the outside---outside%1:15:01:: , an action---action%1:04:02:: is an event---event%1:03:00:: or series---series%1:14:00:: of events---event%1:03:00:: occurring in the physical world---world%1:17:01:: ; regarded from the inside---inside%1:15:01:: , it is the carrying into action---carrying_into_action%1:04:00:: of a certain thought---thought%1:09:01:: .
The historian---historian%1:18:00:: 's business---business%1:04:00:: is to penetrate to the inside---inside%1:15:01:: of the actions---action%1:04:02:: with which he is dealing and reconstruct or rather rethink the thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: which constituted them .
It is a characteristic---characteristic%1:07:00:: of thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: that , in re-thinking them we come , ipso facto , to understand why they were thought '' .
Such an understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: , although it must seek to be sympathetic , is not a matter---matter%1:09:00:: of intuition---intuition%1:09:00:: .
`` History---history%1:09:00:: has this in common with every other science---science%1:09:00:: : that the historian---historian%1:18:00:: is not allowed to claim any single piece---piece%1:06:05:: of knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: , except where he can justify his claim---claim%1:10:00:: by exhibiting to himself in the first place , and secondly to any one else who is both able and willing to follow his demonstration---demonstration%1:10:03:: , the grounds---grounds%1:09:00:: upon which it is based .
This is what was meant , above , by describing history---history%1:09:00:: as inferential .
The knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: in virtue of which a man---man%1:18:04:: is an historian---historian%1:18:00:: is a knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of what the evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: at his disposal---disposal%1:07:00:: proves about certain events---event%1:03:00:: '' .
It is obvious that the historian---historian%1:18:00:: who seeks to recapture the ideas---idea%1:09:00:: that have motivated human behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: throughout a given period---period%1:28:00:: will find the art---art%1:06:00:: and literature---literature%1:10:00:: of that age---age%1:28:02:: one of his central and major concerns---concern%1:09:00:: , by no means a mere supplement---supplement%1:06:00:: or adjunct---adjunct%1:17:00:: of significant historical research---research%1:09:00:: .
The student---student%1:18:01:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: and their place---place%1:09:00:: in history---history%1:09:00:: will always be concerned with the patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: of transition---transition%1:04:00:: , which are at the same time patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: of transformation---transformation%1:11:00:: , whereby ideas---idea%1:09:00:: pass from one area---area%1:09:00:: of activity---activity%1:04:00:: to another .
Let us survey for a moment---moment%1:28:00:: the development---development%1:22:02:: of modern thought---thought%1:09:02:: - turning our attention---attention%1:09:00:: from the Reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movements---movement%1:04:03:: that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decades---decade%1:28:00:: .
We may thus trace the notion---notion%1:09:00:: of individual autonomy---autonomy%1:26:01:: from its manifestation---manifestation%1:11:00:: in religious practice---practice%1:04:00:: and theological reflection---reflection%1:09:00:: through practical politics---politics%1:04:00:: and political theory---theory%1:09:00:: into literature---literature%1:10:00:: and the arts---art%1:06:00:: .
Finally we may note that the idea---idea%1:09:00:: appears in educational theory---theory%1:09:00:: where its influence---influence%1:07:00:: is at present widespread .
No one will deny that such broad developments---development%1:11:01:: and transitions---transition%1:04:00:: are of great intrinsic interest---interest%1:07:02:: and the study---study%1:04:00:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: in literature---literature%1:10:00:: would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference---reference%1:10:02:: to them .
Still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations of this sort unless we are ready to consider many special instances of influence---influence%1:07:00:: moving between such areas as theology , philosophy , political thought , and literature .
Still , we must remember that we cannot construct and justify generalizations---generalization%1:09:03:: of this sort---sort%1:09:00:: unless we are ready to consider many special instances---instance%1:11:00:: of influence---influence%1:04:00:: moving between such areas---area%1:09:00:: as theology---theology%1:09:01:: , philosophy---philosophy%1:09:00:: , political thought---thought%1:09:02:: , and literature---literature%1:10:00:: .
The actual moments---moment%1:28:00:: of contact---contact%1:04:02:: are vitally important .
These moments---moment%1:28:00:: are historical events---event%1:03:00:: in the lives---life%1:28:00:: of individual authors---author%1:18:00:: with which the student---student%1:18:01:: of comparative literature---comparative_literature%1:09:00:: must be frequently concerned .
Perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recurring literary influence---influence%1:09:00:: on the Western world---world%1:14:01:: has been that of the Old---old_testament%1:10:00:: and New Testament---new_testament%1:10:00:: .
Certainly one of the most important comments---comment%1:10:01:: that can be made upon the spiritual and cultural life---life%1:26:01:: of any period---period%1:28:00:: of Western civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: during the past sixteen or seventeen centuries---century%1:28:00:: has to do with the way---way%1:07:01:: in which its leaders---leaders%1:14:00:: have read and interpreted the Bible---bible%1:10:00:: .
This reading---reading%1:09:00:: and the comments---comment%1:10:01:: that it evoked constitute the influence---influence%1:09:00:: .
A contrast---contrast%1:04:00:: of the scripture---scripture%1:10:00:: reading---reading%1:09:00:: of , let us say , St. Augustine---person%1:03:00:: , John Bunyan---person%1:03:00:: , and Thomas Jefferson---person%1:03:00:: , all three---three%1:23:00:: of whom found in such study---study%1:09:04:: a real source---source%1:09:00:: of enlightenment---enlightenment%1:09:00:: , can tell us a great deal---great_deal%1:23:00:: about these three men---man%1:18:00:: and the age---age%1:28:02:: that each represented and helped bring to conscious expression---expression%1:10:04:: .
In much the same way---way%1:07:01:: , we recognize the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: 's familarity---familiarity%1:09:00:: with Plutarch---person%1:03:00:: and Montaigne---person%1:03:00:: , of Shelley---person%1:03:00:: 's study---study%1:04:00:: of Plato---plato%1:18:00:: 's dialogues---dialogue%1:10:02:: , and of Coleridge---coleridge%1:18:00:: 's enthusiastic plundering of the writings---writing%1:10:02:: of many philosophers---philosopher%1:18:00:: and theologians---theologian%1:18:00:: from Plato---plato%1:18:00:: to Schelling---person%1:03:00:: and William Godwin---person%1:03:00:: , through which so many abstract ideas---idea%1:09:00:: were brought to the attention---attention%1:09:00:: of English men of letters---man_of_letters%1:18:00:: .
We may also recognize cases---case%1:11:00:: in which the poets---poet%1:18:00:: have influenced the philosophers---philosopher%1:18:00:: and even indirectly the scientists---scientist%1:18:00:: .
English philosopher---philosopher%1:18:00:: Samuel Alexander---person%1:03:00:: 's debt---debt%1:26:00:: to Wordsworth---wordsworth%1:18:00:: and Meredith---person%1:03:00:: is a recent interesting example---example%1:09:00:: , as also A. N. Whitehead---person%1:03:00:: 's understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of the English romantics---romantic%1:18:01:: , chiefly Shelley---person%1:03:00:: and Wordsworth---wordsworth%1:18:00:: .
Hegel---hegel%1:18:00:: 's profound admiration---admiration%1:12:01:: for the insights---insight%1:09:02:: of the Greek tragedians---tragedian%1:18:02:: indicates a broad channel of classical influence---influence%1:09:00:: upon nineteenth century---century%1:28:00:: philosophy---philosophy%1:09:00:: .
Again the student---student%1:18:01:: of evolutionary biology---biology%1:09:00:: will find a fascinating , if to our minds---mind%1:09:04:: grotesque , anticipation of the theory---theory%1:09:01:: of chance variations---variation%1:11:01:: and the natural elimination---elimination%1:04:02:: of the unfit in Lucretius---person%1:03:00:: , who in turn seems to have borrowed the concept---concept%1:09:00:: from the philosopher---philosopher%1:18:00:: Empedocles---person%1:03:00:: .
Here an important caveat---caveat%1:10:01:: is in order .
We must avoid the notion---notion%1:09:00:: , suggested to some people---people%1:14:00:: by examples---example%1:09:00:: such as those just mentioned , that ideas---idea%1:09:00:: are `` units---unit%1:09:00:: '' in some way comparable to coins---coin%1:21:02:: or counters---counter%1:06:03:: that can be passed intact from one group---group%1:03:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: to another or even , for that matter , from one individual---individual%1:03:00:: to another .
A former du Pont---group%1:03:00:: official---official%1:18:01:: became a General Motors---group%1:03:00:: vice president---vice_president%1:18:00:: and set about maximizing du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's share---share%1:21:00:: of the General Motors---group%1:03:00:: market---market%1:14:00:: .
Lines of communications were established between the two companies and several du Pont products---product%1:06:01:: were actively promoted .
Lines---line%1:10:05:: of communications---communication%1:10:01:: were established between the two companies---company%1:14:01:: and several du Pont---group%1:03:00:: products---product%1:06:00:: were actively promoted .
Within a few years---year%1:28:01:: various du Pont---group%1:03:00:: manufactured items---item%1:06:00:: were filling the entire requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: of from four to seven of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: ' eight operating divisions---division%1:09:00:: .
The Fisher Body---group%1:03:00:: division---division%1:09:00:: , long controlled by the Fisher---person%1:03:00:: brothers---brother%1:18:00:: under a voting trust---voting_trust%1:21:00:: even though General Motors---group%1:03:00:: owned a majority---majority%1:07:00:: of its stock---stock%1:21:00:: , followed an independent course---course%1:04:00:: for many years---year%1:28:01:: , but by 1947 and 1948 `` resistance---resistance%1:04:02:: had collapsed '' and its purchases---purchase%1:21:00:: from du Pont---group%1:03:00:: `` compared favorably '' with purchases---purchase%1:21:00:: by other General Motors---group%1:03:00:: divisions---division%1:09:00:: .
Competitors---competitor%1:18:00:: came to receive higher percentage---percentage%1:21:00:: of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: business---business%1:04:02:: in later years---year%1:28:01:: , but it is `` likely '' that this trend---trend%1:15:02:: stemmed `` at least in part '' from the needs---need%1:26:00:: of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: outstripping du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's capacity---capacity%1:04:00:: .
`` The fact that sticks out in this voluminous record---record%1:04:01:: is that the bulk of du Pont 's production has always supplied the largest part---part%1:24:00:: of the requirements of the one customer in the automobile industry connected to du Pont by a stock interest .
`` The fact---fact%1:10:01:: that sticks out in this voluminous record---record%1:10:02:: is that the bulk---bulk%1:07:02:: of du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's production---production%1:04:00:: has always supplied the largest part---part%1:04:03:: of the requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: of the one customer---customer%1:18:00:: in the automobile industry---automobile_industry%1:14:00:: connected to du Pont---group%1:03:00:: by a stock---stock%1:21:00:: interest---interest%1:21:03:: .
The inference---inference%1:09:00:: is overwhelming that du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's commanding position---position%1:26:00:: was promoted by its stock---stock%1:21:00:: interest---interest%1:21:03:: and was not gained solely on competitive merit---merit%1:07:02:: '' .
This Court---court%1:14:00:: agreed with the trial court---trial_court%1:14:00:: `` that considerations---consideration%1:09:01:: of price---price%1:07:00:: , quality---quality%1:07:02:: and service---service%1:04:08:: were not overlooked by either du Pont---group%1:03:00:: or General Motors---group%1:03:00:: '' .

S. , at 607 , outweighed the Government---government%1:14:00:: 's claim---claim%1:04:00:: for relief---relief%1:21:00:: .
This claim---claim%1:04:00:: , as submitted to the District Court---group%1:03:00:: and dismissed by it , 126 F. Supp .235 , alleged violation---violation%1:04:00:: not only of 7 of the Clayton Act , but also of 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act---group%1:03:00:: .
The latter provisions---provision%1:10:00:: proscribe any contract---contract%1:10:00:: , combination---combination_in_restraint_of_trade%1:14:00:: , or conspiracy---conspiracy%1:10:00:: in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization---monopolization%1:04:00:: of , or attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: , combinations---combination%1:14:00:: , or conspiracies---conspiracy%1:10:00:: to monopolize , such trade---trade%1:04:02:: .
The latter provisions proscribe any contract , combination , or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade , and monopolization of , or attempts , combinations , or conspiracies to monopolize , such trade---trade%1:04:05:: .
However , this Court---court%1:14:00:: put to one side---side%1:15:02:: without consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: the Government---government%1:14:00:: 's appeal---appeal%1:04:00:: from the dismissal---dismissal%1:04:01:: of its Sherman Act allegations---allegation%1:10:00:: .
It rested its decision---decision%1:09:00:: solely on 7 , which reads in pertinent part---part%1:24:00:: : `` [ N ] o corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: engaged in commerce---commerce%1:04:00:: shall acquire , directly or indirectly , the whole---whole%1:09:00:: or any part---part%1:21:00:: of the stock---stock%1:21:00:: or other share---share%1:21:00:: capital---capital%1:21:00:: of another corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: engaged also in commerce---commerce%1:04:00:: , where the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of such acquisition---acquisition%1:04:00:: may be to substantially lessen competition---competition%1:24:01:: between the corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: whose stock---stock%1:21:00:: is so acquired and the corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: making the acquisition---acquisition%1:04:00:: , or to restrain such commerce---commerce%1:04:00:: in any section---section%1:15:01:: or community---community%1:14:00:: , or tend to create a monopoly---monopoly%1:26:01:: of any line---line%1:04:00:: of commerce---commerce%1:04:00:: .
This section---section%1:10:00:: shall not apply to corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: purchasing such stock---stock%1:21:00:: solely for investment---investment%1:04:00:: and not using the same by voting or otherwise to bring about , or in attempting to bring about , the substantial lessening---lessening%1:11:00:: of competition---competition%1:24:01:: `` .
The purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of this provision---provision%1:10:00:: was thus explained in the Court---court%1:14:00:: 's opinion---opinion%1:04:01:: : `` Section---section%1:10:00:: 7 is designed to arrest in its incipiency---incipiency%1:28:00:: not only the substantial lessening---lessening%1:11:00:: of competition---competition%1:24:01:: from the acquisition---acquisition%1:04:00:: by one corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: of the whole---whole%1:09:00:: or any part---part%1:21:00:: of the stock---stock%1:21:00:: of a competing corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: , but also to arrest in their incipiency---incipiency%1:28:00:: restraints---restraint%1:04:00:: or monopolies---monopoly%1:26:01:: in a relevant market---market%1:04:00:: which , as a reasonable probability---probability%1:07:01:: , appear at the time---time%1:11:00:: of suit---suit%1:04:00:: likely to result from the acquisition---acquisition%1:04:00:: by one corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: of all or any part---part%1:21:00:: of the stock---stock%1:21:00:: of any other corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: .
The section---section%1:10:00:: is violated whether or not actual restraints---restraint%1:04:00:: or monopolies---monopoly%1:26:01:: , or the substantial lessening---lessening%1:11:00:: of competition---competition%1:24:01:: , have occurred or are intended '' .
Thus , a finding---finding%1:04:01:: of conspiracy---conspiracy%1:10:00:: to restrain trade---trade%1:04:02:: or attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to monopolize was excluded from the Court---court%1:14:00:: 's decision---decision%1:09:00:: .
Thus , a finding of conspiracy to restrain trade---trade%1:04:05:: or attempt to monopolize was excluded from the Court 's decision .
Indeed , as already noted , the Court---court%1:14:00:: proceeded on the assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: that the executives---executive%1:18:00:: involved in the dealings---dealing%1:04:01:: between du Pont---group%1:03:00:: and General Motors---group%1:03:00:: acted `` honorably and fairly '' and exercised their business judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: only to serve what they deemed the best interests---interest%1:07:01:: of their own companies---company%1:14:01:: .
This , however , did not bar finding that du Pont---group%1:03:00:: had become pre-eminent as a supplier---supplier%1:18:00:: of automotive fabrics---fabric%1:06:00:: and finishes---finish%1:07:00:: to General Motors---group%1:03:00:: ; that these products---product%1:06:01:: constituted a `` line---line%1:04:00:: of commerce---commerce%1:04:00:: '' within the meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: of the Clayton Act ; that General Motors---group%1:03:00:: ' share---share%1:21:00:: of the market---market%1:14:00:: for these products---product%1:06:01:: was substantial ; and that competition---competition%1:24:01:: for this share---share%1:21:00:: of the market---market%1:14:00:: was endangered by the financial relationship---relationship%1:26:01:: between the two concerns---concern%1:14:00:: :
`` The statutory policy---policy%1:09:00:: of fostering free competition---competition%1:24:01:: is obviously furthered when no supplier---supplier%1:18:00:: has an advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: over his competitors---competitor%1:18:00:: from an acquisition---acquisition%1:04:00:: of his customer---customer%1:18:00:: 's stock---stock%1:21:00:: likely to have the effects---effect%1:19:00:: condemned by the statute---statute%1:10:00:: .
We repeat , that the test of a violation---violation%1:04:00:: of 7 is whether , at the time---time%1:11:00:: of suit---suit%1:04:00:: , there is a reasonable probability---probability%1:07:01:: that the acquisition---acquisition%1:04:00:: is likely to result in the condemned restraints---restraint%1:04:00:: .
The conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: upon this record---record%1:04:01:: is inescapable that such likelihood---likelihood%1:07:00:: was proved as to this acquisition---acquisition%1:04:00:: '' .
On the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of the findings---finding%1:04:01:: which led to this conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: , the Court---court%1:14:00:: remanded the case---case%1:04:00:: to the District Court---group%1:03:00:: to determine the appropriate relief---relief%1:21:00:: .
The sole guidance---guidance%1:10:00:: given the Court---court%1:14:00:: for discharging the task---task%1:04:01:: committed to it was this : `` The judgment---judgment%1:04:00:: must therefore be reversed and the cause---case%1:04:00:: remanded to the District Court---group%1:03:00:: for a determination---determination%1:04:00:: , after further hearing---hearing%1:04:01:: , of the equitable relief---relief%1:21:00:: necessary and appropriate in the public interest---interest%1:07:01:: to eliminate the effects---effect%1:19:00:: of the acquisition---acquisition%1:04:00:: offensive to the statute---statute%1:10:00:: .
The District Courts---group%1:03:00:: , in the framing---framing%1:04:00:: of equitable decrees---decree%1:10:00:: , are clothed ' with large discretion---discretion%1:26:00:: to model their judgments---judgment%1:04:00:: to fit the exigencies---exigency%1:26:00:: of the particular case---case%1:04:00:: ' .
This brings us to the course---course%1:04:00:: of the proceedings---proceedings%1:04:00:: in the District Court---group%1:03:00:: .
This Court---court%1:14:00:: 's judgment---judgment%1:10:00:: was filed in the District Court---group%1:03:00:: on July---july%1:28:00:: 18 , 1957 .
The first pretrial conference---conference%1:14:00:: - held to appoint amici curiae---amicus_curiae%1:18:00:: to represent the interest---interest%1:07:01:: of the stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: of du Pont---group%1:03:00:: and General Motors---group%1:03:00:: and to consider the procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: to be followed in the subsequent hearings---hearing%1:04:01:: - took place on September---september%1:28:00:: 25 , 1957 .
At the outset---outset%1:28:00:: , the Government---government%1:14:00:: 's spokesman---spokesman%1:18:00:: explained that counsel---counsel%1:18:00:: for the Government---government%1:14:00:: and for du Pont---group%1:03:00:: had already held preliminary discussions---discussion%1:10:02:: with a view---view%1:09:00:: to arriving at a relief---relief%1:21:00:: plan---plan%1:09:00:: that both sides---side%1:14:00:: could recommend to the court---court%1:14:00:: .
Du Pont---group%1:03:00:: , he said , had proposed disenfranchisement---disenfranchisement%1:04:00:: of its General Motors---group%1:03:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: along with other restrictions on the du Pont-General Motors---group%1:03:00:: relationship---relationship%1:26:01:: .
The Government---government%1:14:00:: , deeming these suggestions---suggestion%1:10:00:: inadequate , had urged that any judgment---judgment%1:04:00:: include divestiture---divestiture%1:10:00:: of du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's shares---share%1:21:01:: of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: .
Counsel---counsel%1:18:00:: for the Government---government%1:14:00:: invited du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's views---view%1:10:00:: on this proposal---proposal%1:10:00:: before recommending a specific program---program%1:09:00:: , but stated that if the court---court%1:14:00:: desired , or if counsel---counsel%1:18:00:: for du Pont---group%1:03:00:: thought further discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: would not be profitable , the Government---government%1:14:00:: was prepared to submit a plan---plan%1:09:00:: within thirty days---day%1:28:00:: .
Counsel---counsel%1:18:00:: for du Pont---group%1:03:00:: indicated a preference---preference%1:09:01:: for the submission---submission%1:10:00:: of detailed plans---plan%1:09:00:: by both sides---side%1:14:00:: at an early date---date%1:28:04:: .
No previous antitrust case---antitrust_case%1:04:00:: , he said , had involved interests---interest%1:21:03:: of such magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: or presented such complex problems---problem%1:26:00:: of relief---relief%1:21:00:: .
The submission---submission%1:10:00:: of detailed plans---plan%1:09:00:: would place the issues---issue%1:09:01:: before the court---court%1:14:00:: more readily than would discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: of divestiture---divestiture%1:10:00:: or disenfranchisement---disenfranchisement%1:04:00:: in the abstract---abstract%1:09:00:: .
The Court---court%1:14:00:: adopted this procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: with an appropriate time---time%1:11:00:: schedule---schedule%1:09:00:: for carrying it out .
The Government---government%1:14:00:: submitted its proposed decree---decree%1:10:00:: on October---october%1:28:00:: 25 , 1957 .
The plan---plan%1:09:00:: called for divestiture---divestiture%1:10:00:: by du Pont---group%1:03:00:: of its 63000000 shares---share%1:21:01:: of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: by equal annual distributions---distribution%1:04:00:: to its stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: , as a dividend---dividend%1:21:00:: , over a period---period%1:28:00:: of ten years---year%1:28:01:: .
Christiana Securities Company---group%1:03:00:: and Delaware Realty + Investment Company---group%1:03:00:: , major stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: in du Pont---group%1:03:00:: , and the stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: of Delaware---group%1:03:00:: were dealt with specially by provisions---provision%1:10:00:: requiring the annual sale---sale%1:04:00:: by a trustee---trustee%1:18:00:: , again over a ten year---year%1:28:01:: period---period%1:28:00:: , of du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's General Motors---group%1:03:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: allocable to them , as well as any General Motors---group%1:03:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: which Christiana---group%1:03:00:: and Delaware---group%1:03:00:: owned outright .
If , in the trustee---trustee%1:18:00:: 's judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: , `` reasonable market---market%1:04:00:: conditions---condition%1:26:00:: '' did not prevail during any given year---year%1:28:01:: , he was to be allowed to petition the court---court%1:14:00:: for an extension---extension%1:28:00:: of time---time%1:28:05:: within the ten year---year%1:28:01:: period---period%1:28:00:: .
In addition , the right to vote---right_to_vote%1:07:00:: the General Motors---group%1:03:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: held by du Pont---group%1:03:00:: was to be vested in du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: , other than Christiana---group%1:03:00:: and Delaware---group%1:03:00:: and the stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: of Delaware---group%1:03:00:: ; du Pont---group%1:03:00:: , Christiana---group%1:03:00:: , and Delaware---group%1:03:00:: were to be enjoined from acquiring stock---stock%1:21:00:: in or exercising control---control%1:07:00:: over General Motors---group%1:03:00:: ; du Pont---group%1:03:00:: , Christiana---group%1:03:00:: , and Delaware---group%1:03:00:: were to be prohibited to have any director---director%1:18:03:: or officer---officer%1:18:02:: in common with General Motors---group%1:03:00:: , and vice versa ; and General Motors---group%1:03:00:: and du Pont---group%1:03:00:: were to be ordered to terminate any agreement---agreement%1:09:00:: that provided for the purchase---purchase%1:04:00:: by General Motors---group%1:03:00:: of any specified percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of its requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: of any du Pont---group%1:03:00:: manufactured product---product%1:06:01:: , or for the grant---grant%1:21:02:: of exclusive patent rights---patent_right%1:07:00:: , or for a grant---grant%1:21:02:: by General Motors---group%1:03:00:: to du Pont---group%1:03:00:: of a preferential right---right%1:07:00:: to make or sell any chemical discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: , or for the maintenance---maintenance%1:04:00:: of any joint commercial enterprise---commercial_enterprise%1:14:00:: by the two companies---company%1:14:01:: .
In addition , the right to vote the General Motors stock held by du Pont was to be vested in du Pont 's stockholders , other than Christiana and Delaware and the stockholders of Delaware ; du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be enjoined from acquiring stock in or exercising control over General Motors ; du Pont , Christiana , and Delaware were to be prohibited to have any director or officer in common with General Motors , and vice versa ; and General Motors and du Pont were to be ordered to terminate any agreement---agreement%1:10:01:: that provided for the purchase by General Motors of any specified percentage of its requirements of any du Pont manufactured product , or for the grant of exclusive patent rights , or for a grant by General Motors to du Pont of a preferential right to make or sell any chemical discovery of General Motors , or for the maintenance of any joint commercial enterprise by the two companies .
On motion---motion%1:10:01:: of the amici curiae---amicus_curiae%1:18:00:: , the court---court%1:14:00:: directed that a ruling---ruling%1:04:00:: be obtained from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue---person%1:03:00:: as to the federal income tax---income_tax%1:21:00:: consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: of the Government---government%1:14:00:: 's plan---plan%1:09:00:: .
On May---may%1:28:00:: 9 , 1958 , the Commissioner---commissioner%1:18:00:: announced his rulings---ruling%1:04:00:: .
The annual dividends---dividend%1:21:00:: paid to du Pont---group%1:03:00:: stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: in shares---share%1:21:01:: of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: would be taxable as ordinary income---income%1:21:00:: to the extent---extent%1:26:00:: of du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's earnings---earnings%1:21:01:: and profits---profits%1:21:01:: .
The measure , for federal income tax---income_tax%1:21:00:: purposes---purpose%1:07:00:: , of the dividend---dividend%1:21:00:: to individual stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: would be the fair market value---market_value%1:21:00:: of the shares---share%1:21:01:: at the time---time%1:11:00:: of each annual distribution---distribution%1:04:00:: .
In the case---case%1:26:00:: of taxpaying corporate stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: , the measure would be the lesser of the fair market value---market_value%1:21:00:: of the shares---share%1:21:01:: or du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's tax---tax%1:21:00:: basis---basis%1:09:00:: for them , which is approximately $ 2.09 per share---share%1:21:01:: .
The forced sale---forced_sale%1:10:00:: of the General Motors---group%1:03:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: owned by or allocable to Christiana---group%1:03:00:: , Delaware---group%1:03:00:: , and the stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: of Delaware---group%1:03:00:: , and deposited with the trustee---trustee%1:18:00:: , would result in a tax---tax%1:21:00:: to those parties---party%1:14:02:: at the capital gains---capital_gain%1:21:00:: rate---rate%1:21:00:: .
Du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's counterproposal---counterproposal%1:10:00:: was filed on May---may%1:28:00:: 14 , 1958 .
Under its plan---plan%1:09:00:: du Pont---group%1:03:00:: would retain its General Motors---group%1:03:00:: shares---share%1:21:01:: but be required to pass on to its stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: the right to vote---right_to_vote%1:07:00:: those shares---share%1:21:01:: .
Christiana---group%1:03:00:: and Delaware---group%1:03:00:: would , in turn , be required to pass on the voting rights---voting_right%1:07:00:: to the General Motors---group%1:03:00:: shares---share%1:21:01:: allocable to them to their own stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: .
Du Pont---group%1:03:00:: would be enjoined from having as a director---director%1:18:03:: , officer---officer%1:18:02:: , or employee---employee%1:18:00:: anyone who was simultaneously an officer---officer%1:18:02:: or employee---employee%1:18:00:: of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: , and no director---director%1:18:03:: , officer---officer%1:18:02:: , or employee---employee%1:18:00:: of du Pont---group%1:03:00:: could serve as a director---director%1:18:03:: of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: without court---court%1:14:00:: approval---approval%1:04:02:: .
Du Pont---group%1:03:00:: would be denied the right---right%1:07:00:: to acquire any additional General Motors---group%1:03:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: except through General Motors---group%1:03:00:: ' distributions---distribution%1:04:00:: of stock---stock%1:21:00:: or subscription rights---subscription_right%1:21:00:: to its stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: .
On June---june%1:28:00:: 6 , 1958 , General Motors---group%1:03:00:: submitted its objections---objection%1:10:01:: to the Government---government%1:14:00:: 's proposal---proposal%1:10:00:: .
It argued , inter alia , that a divestiture---divestiture%1:10:00:: order---order%1:10:03:: would severely depress the market value---market_value%1:21:00:: of the stock---stock%1:21:00:: of both General Motors---group%1:03:00:: and du Pont---group%1:03:00:: , with consequent serious loss---loss%1:21:01:: and hardship---hardship%1:26:01:: to hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of innocent investors---investor%1:18:00:: , among them thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of small trusts---trust%1:14:00:: and charitable institutions---institution%1:14:00:: ; that there would be a similar decline---decline%1:22:01:: in the market values---market_value%1:21:00:: of other automotive and chemical stocks---stock%1:21:00:: , with similar losses---loss%1:21:01:: to the stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: of those companies---company%1:14:01:: ; that the tremendous volume---volume%1:07:03:: of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: hanging over the market---market%1:04:00:: for ten years---year%1:28:01:: would hamper the efforts---effort%1:04:00:: of General Motors---group%1:03:00:: and other automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: manufacturers---manufacturer%1:14:00:: to raise equity---equity%1:21:01:: capital---capital%1:21:00:: ; and that all this would have a serious adverse effect---effect%1:19:00:: on the entire stock market---stock_market%1:06:00:: and on general business activity---business_activity%1:04:00:: .
General Motors---group%1:03:00:: comprehensively contended that the Government---government%1:14:00:: plan---plan%1:09:00:: would not be `` in the public interest---interest%1:07:01:: '' as required by the mandate---mandate%1:10:00:: of this Court---court%1:14:00:: .
The decrees---decree%1:10:00:: proposed by the amici curiae---amicus_curiae%1:18:00:: were filed in August---august%1:28:00:: of 1958 .
These plans---plan%1:09:00:: , like du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's contained provisions---provision%1:10:00:: for passing the vote---vote%1:07:00:: on du Pont---group%1:03:00:: 's General Motors---group%1:03:00:: shares---share%1:21:01:: on to the ultimate stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: of du Pont---group%1:03:00:: , Christiana---group%1:03:00:: , and Delaware---group%1:03:00:: , except that officers---officer%1:18:02:: and directors---director%1:18:03:: of the three companies---company%1:14:01:: , their spouses---spouse%1:18:00:: , and other people---people%1:14:02:: living in their households---household%1:14:00:: , as well as other specified persons---person%1:03:00:: , were to be totally disenfranchised .
Both plans---plan%1:09:00:: also prohibited common directors---director%1:18:03:: , officers---officer%1:18:02:: , or employees---employee%1:18:00:: between du Pont---group%1:03:00:: , Christiana---group%1:03:00:: , and Delaware---group%1:03:00:: , on the one hand , and General Motors---group%1:03:00:: on the other .
Thomas Douglas---person%1:03:00:: , fifth Earl---earl%1:18:00:: of Selkirk---location%1:03:00:: , a noble humanitarian Scot---scot%1:18:00:: concerned with the plight---plight%1:26:00:: of the crofters---crofter%1:18:00:: of his native Highlands---location%1:03:00:: , conceived a plan---plan%1:09:00:: to settle them in the valley---valley%1:17:00:: of the Red River---red_river%1:17:00:: of the North---north%1:15:02:: .
Since the land---land%1:21:01:: he desired lay within the great northern empire---empire%1:15:00:: of the Hudson's Bay Company---group%1:03:00:: , he purchased great blocks---block%1:14:00:: of the Company's---group%1:03:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: with the view---view%1:09:00:: to controlling its policies---policy%1:09:00:: .
Having achieved this end---end%1:09:02:: , he was able to buy 116000 square miles---square_mile%1:23:00:: in the valleys---valley%1:17:00:: of the Red---red%1:17:00:: and Assiniboine---location%1:03:00:: rivers---river%1:17:00:: .
The grant---grant%1:21:02:: , which stretched southward to Lake Traverse---location%1:03:00:: - the headwaters of the Red---red%1:17:00:: - was made in May---may%1:28:00:: , 1811 , and by October---october%1:28:00:: of that year---year%1:28:01:: a small group---group%1:03:00:: of Scots---scot%1:18:00:: was settling for the winter---winter%1:28:00:: at York Factory---location%1:03:00:: on Hudson Bay---hudson_bay%1:17:00:: .
Thus at the same time---time%1:11:00:: that William Henry Harrison---person%1:03:00:: was preparing to pacify the aborigines---aborigine%1:18:00:: of Indiana Territory---location%1:03:00:: and winning fame---fame%1:26:01:: at the battle---battle%1:04:00:: of Tippecanoe---location%1:03:00:: , Anglo-Saxon settlement---settlement%1:04:01:: made a great leap---leap%1:11:00:: into the center---center%1:15:01:: of the North American continent---continent%1:17:00:: to the west---west%1:24:00:: of the American agricultural frontier .
Seven hundred miles---mile%1:23:01:: south of York Factory---location%1:03:00:: , at `` the Forks---location%1:03:00:: '' of the Red---red%1:17:00:: and the Assiniboine---location%1:03:00:: , twenty-three men---man%1:18:00:: located a settlement---settlement%1:14:00:: in August---august%1:28:00:: 1812 .
By October---october%1:28:00:: the little colony---colony%1:14:00:: about Fort Douglas---location%1:03:00:: ( present-day Winnipeg---winnipeg%1:15:00:: ) numbered 100 .
Within a few years---year%1:28:01:: the Scots---scot%1:18:00:: , engaged in breaking the thick sod---sod%1:17:00:: and stirring the rich soil---soil%1:17:00:: of the valley---valley%1:17:00:: , were joined by a group---group%1:03:00:: called Meurons---person%1:03:00:: .
The latter , members---member%1:18:00:: of two regiments---regiment%1:14:00:: of Swiss mercenaries---mercenary%1:18:00:: transported by Great Britain---great_britain%1:15:01:: to Canada---canada%1:15:00:: to fight the Americans---american%1:18:00:: in the War of 1812 , had settled in Montreal---montreal%1:15:00:: and Kingston---location%1:03:00:: at the close---close%1:28:00:: of the war---war%1:26:00:: in 1815 .
Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: persuaded eighty men---man%1:18:03:: and four officers---officer%1:18:03:: to go to Red River---red_river%1:17:00:: where they were to serve as a military force---military_force%1:14:00:: to protect his settlers---settler%1:18:00:: from the hostile Northwest Company---group%1:03:00:: which resented the intrusion---intrusion%1:11:00:: of farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: into the fur---fur%1:05:00:: traders---trader%1:18:00:: ' empire---empire%1:15:00:: .
The mercenaries---mercenary%1:18:00:: were little interested in farming---farming%1:04:00:: and added nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to the output---output%1:04:00:: of the farm---farm%1:06:00:: plots---plot%1:15:00:: on which all work---work%1:04:00:: was still done with hoes---hoe%1:06:00:: as late as 1818 .
It was the low yield---yield%1:06:00:: of the Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: plots---plot%1:15:00:: and the ravages---ravage%1:11:00:: of grasshoppers---grasshopper%1:05:00:: in 1818 that led to the dispersal---dispersal%1:04:00:: of the settlement---settlement%1:14:00:: southward .
When late in the summer---summer%1:28:00:: the full extent---extent%1:26:00:: of the damage---damage%1:11:00:: was assessed , all but fifty of the Scots---scot%1:18:00:: , Swiss---swiss%1:18:00:: and metis---metis%1:18:00:: moved up the Red---red%1:17:00:: to the mouth---mouth%1:17:00:: of the Pembina---location%1:03:00:: river---river%1:17:00:: .
Here they built huts---hut%1:06:01:: and a stockade---stockade%1:06:01:: named Fort Daer---location%1:03:00:: after Selkirk's---person%1:03:00:: barony---barony%1:21:00:: in Scotland---scotland%1:15:00:: .
The new site---site%1:15:00:: was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas---location%1:03:00:: and much closer to the great herds---herd%1:14:01:: of buffalo---buffalo%1:05:02:: on which the settlement---settlement%1:14:00:: must depend for food---food%1:03:00:: .
The Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: settlers---settler%1:18:00:: had been anticipated in their move---move%1:04:01:: southward by British fur---fur%1:27:00:: traders---trader%1:18:00:: .
For many years---year%1:28:01:: the Northwest Company---group%1:03:00:: had its southern headquarters---headquarters%1:06:01:: at Prairie du Chien---location%1:03:00:: on the Mississippi River---mississippi_river%1:17:00:: , some 300 miles---mile%1:23:01:: southeast of present-day St. Paul---st._paul%1:15:00:: , Minnesota---minnesota%1:15:00:: .
When in 1816 an act---act%1:10:01:: of Congress---congress%1:14:01:: forced the foreign firm---firm%1:14:00:: out of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: , its British born employees---employee%1:18:00:: , now become American citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: - Joseph Rolette---person%1:03:00:: , Joseph Renville---person%1:03:00:: and Alexis Bailly---person%1:03:00:: - continued in the fur---fur%1:27:00:: business---business%1:04:01:: .
On Big Stone Lake---location%1:03:00:: near the headwaters of the Red River---red_river%1:17:00:: , Robert Dickson---person%1:03:00:: , Superintendent---superintendent%1:18:00:: of the Western Indian Department---group%1:03:00:: of Canada---canada%1:15:00:: , had a trading post---trading_post%1:06:00:: and planned in 1818 to build a fort---fort%1:06:00:: to be defended by twenty men---man%1:18:03:: and two small artillery---artillery%1:06:00:: pieces---piece%1:06:03:: .
His trading---trading%1:04:00:: goods came from Canada---canada%1:15:00:: to the Forks---fork%1:04:00:: of Red River---red_river%1:17:00:: and from Selkirk's---person%1:03:00:: settlement---settlement%1:14:01:: he brought them south in carts---cart%1:06:00:: .
These carts---cart%1:06:00:: were of a type---type%1:18:00:: devised in Pembina---location%1:03:00:: in the days---day%1:28:05:: of Alexander Henry---person%1:03:00:: the Younger about a decade---decade%1:28:00:: before the Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: colony---colony%1:14:00:: was begun .
In 1802 Henry---person%1:03:00:: referred to `` our new carts---cart%1:06:00:: '' as being about four feet---foot%1:23:00:: off the ground---ground%1:17:00:: and carrying five times as much as a horse---horse%1:05:00:: could pack .
They were held together by pegs---peg%1:06:00:: and withes---withe%1:06:00:: and in later times---time%1:28:00:: drawn by a single ox---ox%1:05:02:: in thills---thill%1:06:00:: .
It was Dickson---person%1:03:00:: who suggested to Lord Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: that he return to the Atlantic coast---coast%1:17:00:: by way---way%1:15:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
In September---september%1:28:00:: 1817 at Fort Daer---location%1:03:00:: ( Pembina---location%1:03:00:: ) Dickson---person%1:03:00:: met the noble lord---lord%1:18:00:: whom , with the help---help%1:04:00:: of a band---band%1:14:01:: of Sioux---sioux%1:18:00:: , he escorted to Prairie du Chien---location%1:03:00:: .
During the trip---trip%1:04:00:: Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: decided that the route---route%1:15:00:: through Illinois---illinois%1:15:00:: territory to Indiana---indiana%1:15:00:: and the eastern United States---united_states%1:15:00:: was the best route---route%1:15:00:: for goods from England---england%1:15:00:: to reach Red River---red_river%1:17:00:: and that the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: was a better source---source%1:15:00:: of supply---supply%1:23:00:: for many goods than either Canada---canada%1:15:00:: or England---england%1:15:00:: .
Upon arriving at Baltimore---baltimore%1:15:00:: , Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: on December---december%1:28:00:: 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams---person%1:03:00:: , Secretary of State---secretary_of_state%1:18:01:: at Washington---washington%1:15:01:: , inquiring about laws---law%1:10:00:: covering trade---trade%1:04:05:: with `` Missouri---location%1:03:00:: and Illinois Territories---location%1:03:00:: '' .
This traffic---traffic%1:04:01:: , he declared prophetically , `` tho ' it might be of small account---account%1:07:01:: at first , would increase with the progress---progress%1:04:01:: of our Settlements---settlement%1:14:01:: '' .
The route---route%1:15:00:: which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route---trade_route%1:06:00:: was followed by his settlers---settler%1:18:00:: earlier than he might have expected .
In 1819 grasshoppers---grasshopper%1:05:00:: again destroyed the crop---crop%1:20:00:: at `` the Forks---fork%1:04:00:: '' ( Fort Douglas---location%1:03:00:: ) and in December---december%1:28:00:: 1819 , twenty men---man%1:18:00:: left Fort Daer---location%1:03:00:: for the most northerly American outpost---outpost%1:14:00:: at Prairie du Chien---location%1:03:00:: .
It was a three month---month%1:28:00:: journey---journey%1:04:00:: in the dead---dead%1:28:00:: of winter---winter%1:28:00:: followed by three months---month%1:28:01:: of labor---labor%1:04:00:: on Mackinac boats---boat%1:06:00:: .
With these completed and ice---ice%1:27:00:: gone from the St. Peter's River---location%1:03:00:: ( present-day Minnesota---minnesota%1:15:00:: river---river%1:17:00:: ) their 250 bushels---bushel%1:23:02:: of wheat---wheat%1:20:00:: , 100 bushels---bushel%1:23:02:: of oats---oat%1:20:00:: and barley---barley%1:13:00:: and 30 bushels---bushel%1:23:02:: of peas---pea%1:13:00:: and some chickens---chicken%1:13:00:: were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats---boat%1:06:00:: and rowed up the river---river%1:17:00:: to Big Stone Lake---location%1:03:00:: , across into Lake Traverse---location%1:03:00:: , and down the Red---red%1:17:00:: .
They reached Fort Douglas---location%1:03:00:: in June---june%1:28:00:: 1820 .
This epic effort---effort%1:04:00:: to secure seed---seed%1:20:02:: for the colony---colony%1:14:00:: cost Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: 1040 .
Nevertheless so short was the supply---supply%1:23:00:: of seed---seed%1:20:02:: that the settlers---settler%1:18:00:: were forced to retreat to Fort Daer---location%1:03:00:: for food---food%1:03:00:: .
Thereafter seed---seed%1:20:02:: and food---food%1:03:00:: became more plentiful and the colony---colony%1:14:00:: remained in the north the year---year%1:28:01:: round .
Activity---activity%1:04:00:: by British traders---trader%1:18:00:: and the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of a colony---colony%1:14:00:: on the Red---red%1:17:00:: prompted the United State---united_states%1:14:00:: War Department---war_department%1:14:00:: in 1819 to send Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Leavenworth---person%1:03:00:: from Detroit---detroit%1:15:00:: to put a post---post%1:06:01:: 300 miles---mile%1:23:01:: northwest of Prairie du Chien---location%1:03:00:: , until then---then%1:28:00:: the most advanced United States---united_states%1:15:00:: post---post%1:06:01:: .
In September---september%1:28:00:: 1822 two companies---company%1:14:03:: of infantry---infantry%1:14:00:: arrived at the mouth---mouth%1:17:00:: of the St. Peter's River---location%1:03:00:: , the head---head%1:15:01:: of navigation---navigation%1:04:00:: on the Mississippi---mississippi%1:17:00:: , and began construction---construction%1:04:00:: of Fort St. Anthony---location%1:03:00:: which , upon completion , was renamed in honor of its commander---commander%1:18:00:: , Colonel Josiah Snelling---person%1:03:00:: .
It was from the American outposts---outpost%1:15:00:: that Red River---red_river%1:17:00:: shortages---shortage%1:26:00:: of livestock---livestock%1:05:00:: were to be made good .
Hercules L. Dousman---person%1:03:00:: , fur---fur%1:27:00:: trader---trader%1:18:00:: and merchant---merchant%1:18:00:: at Prairie du Chien---location%1:03:00:: , contracted to supply Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: 's people---people%1:14:00:: with some 300 head---head%1:05:00:: of cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: , and Alexis Bailly---person%1:03:00:: and Francois Labothe---person%1:03:00:: were hired as drovers---drover%1:18:00:: .
Bailly---person%1:03:00:: , after leaving Fort Snelling---location%1:03:00:: in August---august%1:28:00:: 1821 , was forced to leave some of the cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: at the Hudson's Bay Company's---group%1:03:00:: post---post%1:15:00:: on Lake Traverse---location%1:03:00:: `` in the Sieux Country---location%1:03:00:: '' and reached Fort Garry---location%1:03:00:: , as the Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: Hudson's Bay Company---group%1:03:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: was now called , late in the fall---fall%1:28:00:: .
He set out on his 700 - mile---mile%1:23:01:: return---return%1:04:00:: journey---journey%1:04:00:: with five families---family%1:14:02:: of discontented and disappointed Swiss---swiss%1:18:00:: who turned their eyes---eye%1:08:00:: toward the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
Observing their distressing condition---condition%1:26:00:: , Colonel Snelling---person%1:03:00:: allowed these half starved immigrants---immigrant%1:18:00:: to settle on the military reservation---reservation%1:15:00:: .
As these Swiss---swiss%1:18:00:: were moving from the Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: settlement---settlement%1:14:00:: to become the first civilian residents---resident%1:18:00:: of Minnesota---minnesota%1:15:00:: , Dousman---person%1:03:00:: of Michilimackinac---location%1:03:00:: , Michigan---michigan%1:15:00:: , and Prairie du Chien---location%1:03:00:: was traveling to Red River---red_river%1:17:00:: to open a trade---trade%1:04:05:: in merchandise---merchandise%1:06:00:: .
Early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry---location%1:03:00:: offering to bring in pork---pork%1:13:00:: , flour---flour%1:13:00:: , liquor---liquor%1:13:00:: and tobacco---tobacco%1:06:00:: .
Alexander McDonnell---person%1:03:00:: , governor---governor%1:18:00:: of Red River---location%1:03:00:: , and James Bird---person%1:03:00:: , a chief factor---factor%1:18:00:: of the Hudson's Bay Company---group%1:03:00:: , ordered such `` sundry articles---article%1:03:00:: '' to a value---value%1:21:00:: of 4500 .
For its part---part%1:21:00:: the Hudson's Bay Company---group%1:03:00:: was troubled by the approach---approach%1:04:00:: of American settlement---settlement%1:04:01:: .
As the time---time%1:28:06:: drew near for the drawing of the British American frontier by terms---term%1:10:02:: of the agreement---agreement%1:10:01:: of 1818 , the company---company%1:14:01:: suspected that the Pembina colony---group%1:03:00:: - its own post---post%1:15:00:: and Fort Daer---group%1:03:00:: - was on American territory .
Accordingly Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: 's agents---agent%1:18:02:: ordered the settlers---settler%1:18:00:: to move north , and by October---october%1:28:00:: , John Halkett---person%1:03:00:: had torn down both posts---post%1:15:00:: , floating the timber---timber%1:27:00:: to `` the Forks---location%1:03:00:: '' in rafts---raft%1:06:00:: .
`` I have done everything '' , he wrote , `` to break up the whole---whole%1:09:00:: of that unfortunate establishment---establishment%1:14:00:: '' .
Despite Company---group%1:03:00:: threats---threat%1:10:00:: , duly carried through , to cut off supplies of powder---powder%1:27:01:: , ball---ball%1:06:03:: , and thread---thread%1:06:00:: for fishing nets---fishing_net%1:06:00:: , about 350 persons---person%1:03:00:: stayed in the village---village%1:14:00:: .
They would attempt to bring supplies from St. Louis---st._louis%1:15:00:: or Prairie du Chien---location%1:03:00:: at `` great expense---expense%1:21:00:: as well as danger---danger%1:26:00:: '' .
At Fort Garry---location%1:03:00:: some of the Swiss also decided to cast their lot---lot%1:26:00:: with the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: , and in 1823 several families---family%1:14:02:: paid guides---guide%1:18:00:: to take them to Fort Snelling---location%1:03:00:: .
The disasters---disaster%1:26:00:: of 1825 - 1826 caused more to leave .
After heavy rains---rain%1:19:00:: and an onslaught---onslaught%1:11:00:: of mice---mouse%1:05:00:: , snow---snow%1:27:00:: fell on October---october%1:28:00:: 15 , 1825 , and remained on the ground---ground%1:17:00:: through a winter---winter%1:28:00:: so cold that the ice---ice%1:17:00:: on the Red---red%1:17:00:: was five feet---foot%1:23:00:: thick .
In April---april%1:28:00:: came a rapid thaw---thaw%1:19:00:: that produced high waters---water%1:17:00:: which did not recede until mid-June---mid-june%1:28:00:: .
On June---june%1:28:00:: 24 more than 400 families---family%1:14:02:: started the three month---month%1:28:00:: trip---trip%1:04:00:: across the plains---plain%1:17:00:: to the Mississippi---mississippi%1:17:00:: .
By fall---fall%1:28:00:: , 443 survivors---survivor%1:18:03:: of this arduous journey---journey%1:04:00:: were clustered about Fort Snelling---location%1:03:00:: , but most of them were sent on to Galena---location%1:03:00:: and St. Louis---st._louis%1:15:00:: , with a few going as far as Vevay---location%1:03:00:: , Indiana---indiana%1:15:00:: , a notable Swiss center---center%1:15:01:: in the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
In 1837 , 157 Red River---red_river%1:17:00:: people---people%1:14:00:: with more than 200 cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: were living on the reservation---reservation%1:15:00:: at Fort Snelling---location%1:03:00:: .
Below the fort---fort%1:06:01:: , high bluffs---bluff%1:17:00:: extended uninterruptedly for six miles---mile%1:23:01:: along the Mississippi River---mississippi_river%1:17:00:: .
At the point---point%1:15:00:: where they ended , another settlement---settlement%1:14:00:: grew up around a chapel---chapel%1:06:00:: built at the boat---boat%1:06:00:: landing---landing%1:06:00:: by Father Lucian Galtier---person%1:03:00:: in 1840 .
Its people---people%1:14:01:: , including Pierre Bottineau---person%1:03:00:: and other American Fur Company---group%1:03:00:: employees---employee%1:18:00:: and the refugees---refugee%1:18:00:: from Fort Garry---location%1:03:00:: , were joined by the remaining Scots---scot%1:18:00:: and Swiss---swiss%1:18:00:: from Fort Snelling---location%1:03:00:: when Major Joseph Plympton---person%1:03:00:: expelled them from the reservation---reservation%1:15:00:: in May---may%1:28:00:: 1840 .
The resultant town---town%1:15:00:: , platted in 1847 and named for the patron---patron_saint%1:18:00:: of Father Galtier---person%1:03:00:: 's mission---mission%1:14:01:: , St. Paul---person%1:03:00:: , was to become an important center---center%1:15:01:: of the fur---fur%1:27:00:: trade---trade%1:04:05:: and was to take on a new interest---interest%1:07:02:: for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River---red_river%1:17:00:: .
While population---population%1:09:00:: at Fort Garry---location%1:03:00:: increased rapidly , from 2417 in 1831 to 4369 in 1840 , economic opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: did not increase at a similar rate---rate%1:28:00:: .
Accordingly , though the practice---practice%1:04:00:: violated the no trading provision---provision%1:10:00:: of the Selkirk---person%1:03:00:: charter---charter%1:10:00:: which reserved all such activity---activity%1:04:00:: in merchandise---merchandise%1:06:00:: and furs---fur%1:27:00:: to the Hudson's Bay Company---group%1:03:00:: , some settlers---settler%1:18:00:: went into trade---trade%1:04:05:: .
The Company---group%1:03:00:: maintained a store---store%1:06:00:: at which products---product%1:06:01:: of England---england%1:15:00:: could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants---merchant%1:18:00:: on the understanding---understanding%1:10:00:: that they refrain from trading in furs---fur%1:27:00:: .
Despite this prohibiton---prohibition%1:10:00:: , by 1844 some of the Fort Garry---location%1:03:00:: merchants---merchant%1:18:00:: were trading with the Indians---indian%1:18:00:: for furs---fur%1:27:00:: .
In June---june%1:28:00:: 1845 , the Governor---governor%1:18:00:: and Council---council%1:14:01:: of Assiniboia---location%1:03:00:: imposed a 20 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: duty---duty%1:21:00:: on imports---import%1:06:00:: via Hudson's Bay---location%1:03:00:: which were viewed as aimed at the `` very vitals---vitals%1:08:00:: of the Company---group%1:03:00:: 's trade---trade%1:04:05:: and power---power%1:07:00:: '' .
To reduce further the flow---flow%1:04:00:: of goods from England---england%1:15:00:: , the Company---group%1:03:00:: 's local officials---official%1:18:01:: asked that its London---london%1:15:00:: authorities---authorities%1:14:00:: refrain from forwarding---forwarding%1:04:01:: any more trade---trade%1:04:05:: goods to these men---man%1:18:00:: .
With their customary source---source%1:06:00:: of supply---supply%1:23:00:: cut off , the Fort Garry---location%1:03:00:: free traders---free_trader%1:18:00:: engaged three men---man%1:18:00:: to cart goods to them from the Mississippi---mississippi%1:17:00:: country---country%1:15:02:: .
Others carried pemmican---pemmican%1:13:00:: from `` the Forks---location%1:03:00:: '' to St. Paul---st._paul%1:15:00:: and goods from St. Paul---st._paul%1:15:00:: to Red River---red_river%1:17:00:: , as in the summer---summer%1:28:00:: of 1847 when one trader---trader%1:18:00:: , Wells---person%1:03:00:: , transported twenty barrels---barrel%1:06:00:: of whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: to the British settlement---settlement%1:14:00:: .
This trade---trade%1:04:05:: was subject to a tariff---tariff%1:21:00:: of 7.5 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: after February---february%1:28:00:: 1835 , but much---much%1:23:00:: was smuggled into Assiniboia---location%1:03:00:: with the result---result%1:19:00:: that the duty---duty%1:21:00:: was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: on the initiative---initiative%1:07:00:: of the London---london%1:15:00:: committee---committee%1:14:00:: .
The trade---trade%1:04:05:: in a few commodities---commodity%1:06:00:: noted above was to grow in volume---volume%1:23:00:: as a result---result%1:19:00:: of changes---change%1:11:00:: both north and south of the 49 th parallel---parallel%1:15:00:: .
Miraculously , she found exactly the right statement---statement%1:10:00:: .
She began it deliberately , so that none of her words---words%1:10:03:: would be lost on him .
`` I want to tell you something Thomas DeMontez Lord---person%1:03:00:: .
I 'm well aware that you 've got a pedigree---pedigree%1:14:00:: as long as my leg---leg%1:08:01:: , and that I do n't amount to anything .
`` But it do n't matter a-tall '' , Lord---person%1:03:00:: supplied fondly .
`` To me you 'll always be the girl---girl%1:18:00:: o ' my dreams---dream%1:09:03:: , an ' the sweetest flower---flower%1:20:00:: that grows '' .
Beaming idiotically , he pooched out his lips---lip%1:08:00:: and attempted to kiss her .
Lord---person%1:03:00:: nodded agreeably .
He knew that anything a brainy little lady---lady%1:18:02:: like her had to say would be plumb important , as well as pleasin ' to the ear---ear%1:08:00:: , and he did n't want to miss a word---word%1:10:00:: of it .
`` I think you stink , Tom Lord---person%1:03:00:: !
I think you 're mean and hateful and stupid , and - louder '' ? said Joyce---person%1:03:00:: .
So I can hear you while I 'm checkin ' the car---car%1:06:00:: .
Looks like we might be in for a speck---speck%1:23:00:: of trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: '' .
He opened the door---door%1:06:00:: and got out .
He waited at the car---car%1:06:00:: side---side%1:15:02:: for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: , looking down at her expectantly .
Then , helpfully , as she merely stared at him in weary silence---silence%1:07:01:: , `` Maybe you could write it down for me , huh ?
Print it in real big letters---letter%1:10:01:: , an ' I can cipher it out later '' .
He grinned , nodded , and walked around to the front---front%1:15:00:: of the car---car%1:06:00:: .
Lips---lip%1:08:00:: pursed mournfully , he stared down at its crazily sagging left side---side%1:15:02:: .
Then he hunkered down on the heels---heel%1:06:00:: of his handmade boots---boot%1:06:00:: , peered into the orderly chaos---chaos%1:26:00:: of axle---axle%1:06:00:: , shock absorber---shock_absorber%1:06:00:: , and spring---spring%1:06:00:: .
He went prone on his stomach---stomach%1:08:01:: , the better to pursue his examination---examination%1:04:00:: .
After a time---time%1:28:05:: , he straightened again , brushing the red Permian---permian%1:28:00:: dust---dust%1:27:00:: from his hands---hand%1:08:00:: , slapping it from his six dollar---dollar%1:21:00:: levis---levis%1:06:00:: and his tailored , twenty-five dollar---dollar%1:21:00:: shirt---shirt%1:06:00:: .
He wore no gun---gun%1:06:00:: - a strange ommission---omission%1:04:01:: for a peace officer---peace_officer%1:18:00:: in this country---country%1:15:00:: .
Never , he 'd once told Joyce---person%1:03:00:: , had he encountered any man---man%1:18:04:: or situation---situation%1:26:00:: that called for a gun---gun%1:06:00:: .
And he really feels that way---way%1:26:00:: , she thought .
Just a big pile---pile%1:23:00:: of self-confidence in an almost teensy package .
Just a big pile---pile%1:14:00:: of self-confidence---self-confidence%1:09:00:: in an almost teensy package---package%1:06:00:: .
If I could make myself feel the same way---way%1:26:00:: .
She studied him hopefully , yearningly ; against the limitless background---background%1:09:00:: of sky---sky%1:17:00:: and wasteland---wasteland%1:15:00:: it was easy to confirm her analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: .
Here in the God-forsaken place---place%1:15:00:: , the westerly end---end%1:15:01:: of nowhere---nowhere%1:26:00:: , Tom Lord---person%1:03:00:: looked almost insignificant , almost contemptible .
He was handsome , with his coal-black hair---hair%1:08:00:: and eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , his fine chiseled features---feature%1:08:00:: .
But she 'd known plenty---plenty%1:07:00:: of handsomer guys---guy%1:18:00:: , and , conceding his good looks---good_looks%1:07:00:: , what was there left ?
He was n't a big man---man%1:18:00:: ; rather on the medium side---side%1:09:00:: .
Neither was he very powerful of build---build%1:07:00:: .
He could move very quickly , she knew ( although he seldom found occasion---occasion%1:16:00:: to do so ) , but he was more wiry than truly strong .
And his relatively small hands---hand%1:08:00:: and feet---foot%1:08:01:: gave him an almost delicate appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: .
He caught her eye---eye%1:09:01:: , came back around the car---car%1:06:00:: with the boot---boot%1:06:00:: wearer---wearer%1:18:00:: 's teetering , half mincing walk---walk%1:07:00:: .
Why did these yokels---yokel%1:18:00:: still wear boots---boot%1:06:00:: , anyway , when most had scarcely sat a horse---horse%1:05:00:: in years---year%1:28:01:: ?
He slid in at her side---side%1:15:02:: , tucked a cigar---cigar%1:06:00:: into his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: , and politely proffered one to her .
`` Oh , cut it out , Tom---person%1:03:00:: '' ! she snapped .
`` Ca n't you stop that stupid clowning---clowning%1:04:00:: for even a minute---minute%1:28:00:: '' ?
`` This ai n't your brand---brand%1:10:00:: , maybe '' , Lord---person%1:03:00:: suggested .
`` Or maybe you just do n't feel like a cigar---cigar%1:06:00:: '' ?
`` I feel like getting back to town---town%1:15:00:: , that 's what I feel like !
`` Might get there faster walkin '' ' , Lord---person%1:03:00:: drawled , `` seein ' as how I got a busted front spring---spring%1:06:00:: .
I figger it 's probl ' y a sixty-five mile---mile%1:23:01:: walk---walk%1:04:03:: , and I c ' n maybe get this spring---spring%1:06:00:: patched up in a couple of hours---hour%1:28:00:: '' .
There 's nothing out here but rattlesnakes---rattlesnake%1:05:00:: '' .
`` Now , ai n't it the truth---truth%1:09:00:: '' ?
Lord---person%1:03:00:: laughed with secret amusement---amusement%1:12:00:: .
`` Not a danged thing---thing%1:06:01:: but rattlesnakes---rattlesnake%1:05:00:: , so I reckon I 'll get the boss rattler---rattler%1:05:00:: to help me '' .
`` Tom---person%1:03:00:: !
For God 's sake---sake%1:07:00:: '' !
`` See that wildcat---wildcat%1:06:00:: '' ?
She saw it then , the distant derrick---derrick%1:06:01:: of the wildcat---wildcat%1:06:00:: - a test well---well%1:06:00:: in unexplored country---country%1:15:01:: .
And even with her limited knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of such things---thing%1:09:00:: , she knew that the car---car%1:06:00:: could be repaired there ; sufficiently , at least , to get them back into town---town%1:15:00:: .
A wildcatter---wildcatter%1:18:00:: had to be prepared for almost any emergency---emergency%1:11:00:: .
He had to depend on himself , since he was invariably miles---mile%1:23:01:: and hours---hour%1:28:00:: away from others .
`` What did you mean by that rattlesnake---rattlesnake%1:05:00:: gag---gag%1:10:00:: ?
Getting the boss rattlesnake---rattlesnake%1:05:00:: to help you '' ?
`` Why , I meant what I said '' , Lord---person%1:03:00:: declared .
She looked at him , lips---lip%1:08:00:: compressed .
Then , with a shrug---shrug%1:10:00:: of pretended indifference---indifference%1:12:00:: , she took a compact---compact%1:06:00:: from her purse---purse%1:06:00:: and went through the motions of fixing her make-up---makeup%1:06:00:: .
In his mood---mood%1:12:00:: , it was the best way---way%1:07:01:: to handle him ; that is , to show no curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: whatsoever .
Otherwise , she would be baited into a tantrum---tantrum%1:26:00:: - teased and provoked until she lost control---control%1:07:01:: of herself , and thus lost still another battle---battle%1:04:01:: in the maddening struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: of Tom Lord---person%1:03:00:: Vs. Joyce Lakewood---person%1:03:00:: .
The car---car%1:06:00:: lurched along at a snail---snail%1:05:00:: 's crawl---crawl%1:04:03:: , the left front mudguard---mudguard%1:06:00:: banging and scraping against the tire---tire%1:06:00:: , occasionally scraping against the road---road%1:06:00:: itself .
Lord---person%1:03:00:: whistled tunelessly as he fought the steering wheel---steering_wheel%1:06:00:: .
He seemed very pleased with himself , as though some intricate scheme---scheme%1:09:00:: was working out exactly as he had planned .
Along with this self-satisfaction---self-satisfaction%1:12:00:: , however , Joyce---person%1:03:00:: sensed a growing tension---tension%1:26:03:: .
It poured out of him like an electric current---electric_current%1:19:00:: , a feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: that the muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: and nerves---nerve%1:08:00:: of his fine drawn body---body%1:08:00:: were coiling for action---action%1:26:00:: , and that that action---action%1:26:00:: would be all that he anticipated .
Joyce---person%1:03:00:: had seen him like this once before - more than once , actually , but on one particularly memorable occasion---occasion%1:11:00:: .
That was the day---day%1:28:01:: that he had practically mopped up the main street---main_street%1:06:00:: of Big Sands---location%1:03:00:: with Aaron McBride---person%1:03:00:: , field---field%1:15:01:: boss---boss%1:18:01:: for the Highlands Oil + Gas Company---group%1:03:00:: .
Tom---person%1:03:00:: had been laying for Aaron McBride---person%1:03:00:: for a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: , just waiting to catch him out of line---line%1:04:01:: .
McBride---person%1:03:00:: gave him his opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: when he showed up in town---town%1:15:00:: with a pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: on his hip---hip%1:08:00:: .
He had a legitimate reason---reason%1:16:00:: for wearing it .
It was payday---payday%1:28:00:: for Highlands , and he was packing a lot---lot%1:23:00:: of money---money%1:21:00:: back into the oil fields---oilfield%1:15:00:: .
Moreover , as long as the weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: was carried openly , the sheriff---sheriff%1:18:00:: 's office---office%1:14:01:: had made no previous issue---issue%1:09:01:: of it .
`` So what 's this all about '' ? he demanded , when Lord---person%1:03:00:: confronted him .
I 'm not the only man---man%1:18:00:: in town---town%1:15:00:: with a gun---gun%1:06:00:: , or the only one without a permit---permit%1:10:02:: `` .
It was the wrong thing---thing%1:10:00:: to say .
By failing to do as he was told instantly - to take out a permit---permit%1:10:02:: or return the gun---gun%1:06:00:: to his car---car%1:06:00:: - he had played into Lord---person%1:03:00:: 's hands---hand%1:08:00:: .
The trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: was that he had virtually had to protest .
The deputy had forced him to by his manner---manner%1:07:01:: of accosting him .
The deputy---deputy%1:18:01:: had forced him to by his manner---manner%1:07:02:: of accosting him .
`` Why single me out on this permit---permit%1:10:02:: deal---deal%1:10:00:: '' ?
`` Well , I 'll tell you about that '' , Lord---person%1:03:00:: told him .
Do n't like to bother no one unless we have to , which I figger we do , in your case---case%1:26:00:: .
Figger we got to be plumb careful with any of you Highlands---group%1:03:00:: big shots---big_shot%1:18:00:: '' .
McBride---person%1:03:00:: reddened .
He himself had heard that there was gangster---gangster%1:18:00:: money---money%1:21:00:: in the company---company%1:14:01:: , but that had nothing to do with him .
He was an honest man---man%1:18:00:: doing a hard job---job%1:04:00:: , and the implication---implication%1:10:00:: that he was anything else was unbearable .
`` Look , Lord---person%1:03:00:: '' , he said hoarsely .
`` I know you 've got a grudge---grudge%1:12:00:: against me , and maybe I can n't blame you .
You think that Highlands---group%1:03:00:: swindled you and I helped ' em do it .
But you 're all wrong , man---man%1:18:00:: !
I 'm no lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: .
An ' that could mean trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: with a fella---fella%1:18:00:: that 's workin ' for crooks---crook%1:18:00:: .
So you get rid of that pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: right now , Mis-ter McBride---person%1:03:00:: .
You do that or take you out a permit---permit%1:10:02:: right now '' .
McBride---person%1:03:00:: could n't do either , of course .
Not immediately , as the deputy---deputy%1:18:01:: demanded .
Not without a face-saving respite---respite%1:04:00:: of at least a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
To do so would make his job---job%1:04:00:: well-nigh impossible .
Oil-field---oilfield%1:15:00:: workers---worker%1:18:00:: were a rough tough lot---lot%1:14:00:: .
How could he exert authority---authority%1:07:00:: over them - make them toe the line , as he had to - if he knuckled under to this small-town---small_town%1:14:00:: clown---clown%1:18:01:: ?
`` Just as soon as I go to the bank---bank%1:14:00:: , and '' -
Now , Mis-ter McBride---person%1:03:00:: '' , said Lord---person%1:03:00:: , and he laid a firmly restraining hand---hand%1:08:00:: on the field---field%1:15:01:: boss---boss%1:18:01:: 's arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
It was strictly the deputy---deputy%1:18:01:: 's game---game%1:04:00:: , but McBride---person%1:03:00:: had gone too far to throw in .
Now , he could only play the last card---card%1:06:00:: in what was probably the world 's coldest deck---deck%1:14:00:: .
He flung off Lord---person%1:03:00:: 's hand---hand%1:08:00:: and attempted to push past him , inadvertently shoving him into a storefront---storefront%1:06:00:: .
It was practically the last move---move%1:04:00:: that McBride---person%1:03:00:: made of his own volition---volition%1:09:00:: .
Lord---person%1:03:00:: slugged him in the stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: , so hard that the organ---organ%1:08:00:: almost pressed against his spine---spine%1:08:00:: .
Then , as he doubled , gasping , vomiting the breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: he had so lately eaten , Lord---person%1:03:00:: straightened him with an uppercut---uppercut%1:04:00:: .
A rabbit punch---rabbit_punch%1:04:00:: redoubled him .
And then there was a numbing blow---blow%1:04:01:: to the heart---heart%1:08:00:: , and another gut---gut%1:08:00:: flattening blow---blow%1:04:01:: to the stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: .
He seemed to be fighting not one man---man%1:18:00:: but a dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: .
And he could no longer think of face-saving---face_saving%1:04:00:: , of honor---honor%1:26:00:: , but only of escape---escape%1:04:00:: .
I meant him no harm---harm%1:26:00:: .
I 've given willful hurt---hurt%1:26:00:: to no man---man%1:18:04:: .
I was just doing my job---job%1:04:00:: , just following orders---order%1:10:03:: , and for that he 's going to kill me .
Beat me to death---death%1:19:00:: in front of a hundred people---people%1:14:00:: .
Somehow more terrible than the certainty---certainty%1:09:00:: that he was about to die was the knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: that Lord---person%1:03:00:: would probably not suffer for it : the murder---murder%1:04:00:: would go unpunished .
He , McBride---person%1:03:00:: , would be cited as in the wrong , and he , Lord---person%1:03:00:: , would go scot-free , an officer---officer%1:18:01:: who had only done his duty---duty%1:04:02:: , though perhaps too energetically .
McBride---person%1:03:00:: staggered into the street---street%1:06:00:: , flopped sprawling in the stinging dust---dust%1:27:00:: .
Fear---fear%1:12:00:: maddened , fleeing the lengthening shadow---shadow%1:09:00:: of death---death%1:26:00:: , he scrambled to his feet---foot%1:08:01:: again .
He could n't see ; he was long past the point---point%1:26:00:: of coherent thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: .
Dimly , he heard laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: , hoots---hoot%1:10:01:: of derision---derision%1:10:00:: , but he could not read the racket---racket%1:11:00:: properly .
He could not grasp that Lord---person%1:03:00:: had withdrawn from the fight---fight%1:04:02:: minutes---minute%1:28:00:: ago , and that his leaden arms---arm%1:08:00:: were flailing at nothing but the air---air%1:15:00:: .
He hated them too much to understand - the people---people%1:14:00:: of this isolated law---law%1:14:00:: unto itself world---world%1:09:00:: that was Lord---person%1:03:00:: 's world---world%1:09:00:: .
This , he was sure , was the way---way%1:07:01:: they would act ; laughing at a dying man---man%1:18:00:: , laughing as a man---man%1:18:00:: was beaten to death---death%1:19:00:: .
Donna---person%1:03:00:: !
Donna---person%1:03:00:: , his young wife---wife%1:18:00:: , the girl---girl%1:18:00:: who was both daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: and wife---wife%1:18:00:: to him .
Donna---person%1:03:00:: was like he was .
She lived by the rules---rule%1:10:00:: , never compromising , never blinded or diverted by circumstance---circumstance%1:26:01:: .
And Donna---person%1:03:00:: would -
When he regained consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: he was in Lord---person%1:03:00:: 's house---house%1:06:00:: , in the office---office%1:06:00:: of Doctor Lord---person%1:03:00:: , the deputy---deputy%1:18:01:: 's deceased father---father%1:18:00:: .
There were fences---fence%1:06:00:: in the old days---day%1:28:05:: when we were children---child%1:18:00:: .
Across the front---front%1:15:00:: of a yard---yard%1:06:02:: and down the side---side%1:15:02:: , they were iron---iron%1:27:00:: , either spiked along the top---top%1:15:01:: or arched in half circles---circle%1:25:00:: .
Alley---alley%1:06:00:: fences---fence%1:06:00:: were made of solid boards---board%1:27:00:: higher than one 's head---head%1:08:00:: , but not so high as the golden glow---golden_glow%1:20:00:: in a corner---corner%1:06:02:: or the hollyhocks---hollyhock%1:20:02:: that grew in a line---line%1:14:01:: against them .
Side fences---fence%1:06:00:: were hidden beneath lilacs---lilac%1:20:00:: and hundred leaf roses---rose%1:20:00:: ; front fences---fence%1:06:00:: were covered with Virginia creeper---virginia_creeper%1:20:00:: or trumpet vines---trumpet_vine%1:20:01:: or honeysuckle---honeysuckle%1:20:01:: .
Square corner---corner_post%1:06:00:: - and gate posts---gatepost%1:06:00:: were an open-work---openwork%1:06:00:: pattern---pattern%1:06:00:: of cast-iron---cast_iron%1:27:00:: foliage---foliage%1:06:00:: ; they were topped by steeples---steeple%1:06:00:: complete in every detail---detail%1:24:00:: : high pitched roof---roof%1:06:00:: , pinnacle---pinnacle%1:06:00:: , and narrow gable---gable%1:06:00:: .
On these posts---post%1:06:00:: the gates---gate%1:06:00:: swung open with a squeak---squeak%1:11:00:: and shut with a metallic clang---clang%1:11:00:: .
The only extended view---view%1:09:01:: possible to anyone less tall than the fences---fence%1:06:00:: was that obtained from an upper bough---bough%1:20:00:: of the apple tree---apple_tree%1:20:00:: .
The primary quality---quality%1:07:00:: of that view---view%1:09:02:: seems , now , to have been its quietness---quietness%1:07:00:: , but that cannot at the time---time%1:28:00:: have impressed us .
What one actually remembers is its greenness---greenness%1:07:02:: .
From high in the tree---tree%1:20:00:: , the whole block---block%1:15:00:: lay within range---range%1:15:01:: of the eye---eye%1:08:00:: , but the ground---ground%1:17:00:: was almost nowhere visible .
One looked down on a sea---sea%1:23:00:: of leaves---leaf%1:20:00:: , a breaking wave---wave%1:04:02:: of flower---flower%1:20:02:: .
Every path---path%1:06:00:: from back door---door%1:06:01:: to barn---barn%1:06:00:: was covered by a grape-arbor---grape_arbor%1:06:00:: , and every yard---yard%1:06:02:: had its fruit trees---fruit_tree%1:20:00:: .
In the center---center%1:15:01:: of any open space---space%1:15:00:: remaining our grandfathers---grandfather%1:18:00:: had planted syringa---syringa%1:20:02:: and sweet shrub---sweet_shrub%1:20:00:: , snowball---snowball%1:20:00:: , rose-of-Sharon---rose_of_sharon%1:20:00:: and balm-of-Gilead---balm_of_gilead%1:20:01:: .
From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor---floor%1:17:01:: of this green sea : a neighbor 's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor , or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there , half-way down the block .
From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life---life%1:03:00:: on the floor---floor%1:17:00:: of this green sea---sea%1:23:00:: : a neighbor---neighbor%1:18:00:: 's gingham---gingham%1:06:00:: skirt---skirt%1:06:00:: flashing into sight---sight%1:04:00:: for an instant---instant%1:28:01:: on the path---path%1:06:00:: beneath her grape-arbor---grape_arbor%1:06:00:: , or the movement---movement%1:04:00:: of hands---hand%1:08:00:: above a clothesline---clothesline%1:06:00:: and the flutter---flutter%1:04:00:: of garments---garment%1:06:00:: hung there , half-way down the block---block%1:15:00:: .
That was one epoch---epoch%1:28:00:: : the apple-tree---apple_tree%1:20:00:: epoch---epoch%1:28:00:: .
Time---time%1:03:00:: is a queer thing---thing%1:06:01:: and memory---memory%1:09:01:: a queerer ; the tricks---trick%1:04:05:: that time---time%1:03:00:: plays with memory---memory%1:09:01:: and memory---memory%1:09:01:: with time---time%1:03:00:: are queerest of all .
From maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: one looks back at the succession---succession%1:14:00:: of years---year%1:28:01:: , counts them and makes them many , yet cannot feel length---length%1:07:01:: in the number---number%1:23:00:: , however large .
In a stream---stream%1:17:00:: that turns a mill-wheel---millwheel%1:06:00:: there is a lot of water---water%1:27:00:: ; the mill-pond---millpond%1:17:00:: is quiet , its surface---surface%1:15:00:: dark and shadowed , and there does not seem to be much water---water%1:27:00:: in it .
Time---time%1:03:00:: in the sum---sum%1:06:00:: is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
And yet - a year---year%1:28:01:: to a child---child%1:18:00:: is an eternity---eternity%1:28:01:: , and in the memory---memory%1:09:02:: that phase---phase%1:28:00:: of one 's being---being%1:26:00:: - a certain mental landscape---landscape%1:15:00:: - will seem to have endured without beginning---beginning%1:28:00:: and without end---end%1:28:00:: .
The part---part%1:24:00:: of the mind---mind%1:09:01:: that preserves dates---date%1:28:00:: and events---event%1:03:00:: may remonstrate , `` It could have been like that for only a little while---while%1:28:00:: '' ; but true memory---memory%1:09:01:: does not count nor add : it holds fast to things---thing%1:26:00:: that were and they are outside of time---time%1:03:00:: .
Once , then - for how many years---year%1:28:01:: or how few does not matter - my world---world%1:17:02:: was bound round by fences---fence%1:06:00:: , when I was too small to reach the apple tree---apple_tree%1:20:00:: bough---bough%1:20:00:: , to twist my knee---knee%1:08:00:: over it and pull myself up .
That world---world%1:17:02:: was in scale---scale%1:24:01:: with my own smallness---smallness%1:07:00:: .
I have no picture---picture%1:09:00:: in my mind---mind%1:09:01:: of the garden---garden%1:06:01:: as a whole - that I could not see - but certain aspects---aspect%1:09:01:: of certain corners---corner%1:15:02:: linger in the memory---memory%1:09:02:: : wind-blown , frost-bitten , white chrysanthemums---chrysanthemum%1:20:01:: beneath a window---window%1:06:00:: , with their brittle brown leaves---leaf%1:20:00:: and their sharp scent---scent%1:09:01:: of November---november%1:28:00:: ; ripe pears---pear%1:13:00:: lying in long grass---grass%1:20:00:: , to be turned over by a dusty slippered foot---foot%1:08:01:: , cautiously , lest bees---bee%1:05:00:: still worked in the ragged , brown edged holes---hole%1:17:01:: ; hot colored verbenas---verbena%1:20:00:: in the corner---corner%1:06:02:: between the dining-room---dining_room%1:06:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: and the side porch---porch%1:06:00:: , where we passed on our way to the pump---pump%1:06:00:: with the half gourd---gourd%1:06:00:: tied to it as a cup---cup%1:06:00:: by my grandmother---grandmother%1:18:00:: for our childish pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: in drinking from it .
It was mother---mother%1:18:00:: who planted the verbenas---verbena%1:20:00:: .
I think that my grandmother---grandmother%1:18:00:: was not an impassioned gardener---gardener%1:18:00:: :
she was too indulgent a lover---lover%1:18:01:: of dogs---dog%1:05:00:: and grandchildren---grandchild%1:18:00:: .
My great grandmother---great_grandmother%1:18:00:: , I have been told , made her garden---garden%1:06:01:: her great pride---pride%1:12:01:: ; she cherished rare and delicate plants---plant%1:03:00:: like oleanders---oleander%1:20:00:: in tubs---tub%1:06:00:: and wall-flowers---wallflower%1:20:02:: and lemon---lemon%1:07:00:: verbenas---verbena%1:20:00:: in pots---pot%1:06:04:: that had to be wintered in the cellar---cellar%1:06:00:: ; she filled the waste---waste%1:27:00:: spots---spot%1:15:01:: of the yard---yard%1:06:02:: with common things---thing%1:06:01:: like the garden heliotrope---garden_heliotrope%1:20:00:: in a corner---corner%1:15:02:: by the woodshed---woodshed%1:06:00:: , and the plantain lilies---plantain_lily%1:20:00:: along the west side---west_side%1:15:00:: of the house---house%1:06:00:: .
These my grandmother---grandmother%1:18:00:: left in their places---place%1:15:05:: ( they are still there , more persistent and longer-lived than the generations---generation%1:14:01:: of man ) and planted others like them , that flourished without careful tending---tending%1:04:00:: .
Three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment---commandment%1:10:00:: : the roses---rose%1:20:00:: , whose petals---petal%1:20:00:: might not be collected until they had fallen , to be made into perfume---perfume%1:06:00:: or rose---rose%1:20:00:: tea---tea%1:13:00:: to drink ; the peonies---peony%1:20:00:: , whose tight sticky buds---bud%1:20:02:: would be blighted by the laying on---laying_on%1:04:00:: of a finger---finger%1:08:00:: , although they were not apparently harmed by the ants---ant%1:05:00:: that crawled over them ; and the poppies---poppy%1:20:00:: .
I have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass---grass%1:20:00:: through a long summer---summer%1:28:00:: morning---morning%1:28:00:: and watched without touching while a poppy---poppy%1:20:00:: bud---bud%1:20:02:: higher than my head---head%1:08:00:: slowly but visibly pushed off its cap---cap%1:06:03:: , unfolded , and shook out like a banner---banner%1:06:00:: in the sun---sun%1:19:00:: its flaming vermilion petals---petal%1:20:00:: .
Other flowers---flower%1:20:02:: we might gather as we pleased : myrtle---myrtle%1:20:02:: and white violets---white_violet%1:20:00:: from beneath the lilacs---lilac%1:20:00:: ; the lilacs---lilac%1:20:00:: themselves , that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach---reach%1:15:00:: ; snowballs---snowball%1:20:00:: ; hollyhock---hollyhock%1:20:01:: blossoms---blossom%1:20:00:: that , turned upside down , make pink---pink%1:07:00:: petticoated ladies---lady%1:18:02:: ; and the little , dark blue---dark_blue%1:07:00:: larkspur---larkspur%1:20:00:: that scattered its seed---seed%1:20:02:: everywhere .
More potent a charm---charm%1:06:00:: to bring back that time of life---time_of_life%1:28:00:: than this record---record%1:10:03:: of a few pictures---picture%1:06:00:: and a few remembered facts---fact%1:09:01:: would be a catalogue---catalogue%1:10:01:: of the minutiae---minutia%1:09:00:: which are of the very stuff---stuff%1:27:00:: of the mind---mind%1:09:00:: , intrinsic , because they were known in the beginning not by the eye---eye%1:09:01:: alone but by the hand---hand%1:08:00:: that held them .
Flowers---flower%1:20:02:: , stones---stone%1:17:00:: , and small creatures---creature%1:03:00:: , living and dead .
Pale yellow snapdragons---snapdragon%1:20:00:: that by pinching could be made to bite ; seed-pods---seedpod%1:20:00:: of the balsams---balsam%1:20:00:: that snapped like fire-crackers---firecracker%1:06:00:: at a touch---touch%1:11:00:: ; red and yellow columbines---columbine%1:20:00:: whose round tipped spurs---spur%1:20:00:: were picked off and eaten for the honey---honey%1:13:00:: in them ; morning-glory---morning_glory%1:20:00:: buds---bud%1:20:02:: which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag---paper_bag%1:06:00:: ; bright flowers---flower%1:20:02:: from the trumpet vine---trumpet_vine%1:20:01:: that made `` gloves '' on the ends---end%1:15:00:: of ten waggling fingers---finger%1:08:00:: .
Fuzzy caterpillars---caterpillar%1:05:00:: , snails---snail%1:05:00:: with their sensitive horns---horn%1:05:02:: , struggling grasshoppers---grasshopper%1:05:00:: held by their long hind legs---hind_leg%1:05:00:: and commanded to `` spit tobacco---tobacco%1:06:00:: , spit '' .
Dead---dead%1:14:00:: fledgling birds---bird%1:05:00:: , their squashed looking nakedness---nakedness%1:26:00:: and the odor---odor%1:07:00:: of decay---decay%1:19:00:: that clung to the hand---hand%1:08:00:: when they had been buried in our graveyard---graveyard%1:15:00:: in front of the purple flags---flag%1:20:00:: .
And the cast shell---shell%1:05:02:: of a locust---locust%1:05:00:: , straw colored and transparent , weighing nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: , fragile but entire , with eyes---eye%1:08:00:: like bubbles---bubble%1:17:00:: and a gaping slit---slit%1:06:00:: down its back---back%1:08:00:: .
Every morning---morning%1:28:00:: early , in the summer---summer%1:28:00:: , we searched the trunks---trunk%1:20:00:: of the trees---tree%1:20:00:: as high as we could reach for the locust---locust%1:05:00:: shells---shell%1:05:02:: , carefully detached their hooked claws---claw%1:05:02:: from the bark---bark%1:20:00:: where they hung , and stabled them , a weird faery herd---herd%1:14:00:: , in an angle---angle%1:25:00:: between the high roots---root%1:20:00:: of the tulip tree---tulip_tree%1:20:00:: , where no grass---grass%1:20:00:: grew in the dense shade---shade%1:26:00:: .
We collected `` lucky stones---stone%1:17:00:: '' - all the creamy translucent pebbles---pebble%1:17:00:: , worn smooth and round , that we could find in the driveway---driveway%1:06:00:: .
When these had been pocketed , we could still spend a morning---morning%1:28:00:: cracking open other pebbles---pebble%1:17:00:: for our delight---delight%1:12:00:: in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors---exterior%1:15:00:: indicated .
Squatting on our haunches---haunch%1:08:01:: beside the flat stone---stone%1:17:00:: we broke them on , we were safe behind the high closed gates---gate%1:06:00:: at the end---end%1:15:00:: of the drive---drive%1:06:01:: : safe from interruption---interruption%1:04:00:: and the observation---observation%1:04:00:: and possible amusement---amusement%1:12:00:: of the passers-by---passerby%1:18:00:: .
Thus shielded , we played many foolish games---game%1:04:01:: in comfortable unselfconsciousness---unselfconsciousness%1:09:00:: ; even when the fences---fence%1:06:00:: became a part---part%1:24:00:: of the game---game%1:04:01:: - when a vine---vine%1:20:00:: embowered gate-post---gatepost%1:06:00:: was the Sleeping Beauty---sleeping_beauty%1:18:00:: 's enchanted castle---castle%1:06:02:: , or when Rapunzel---person%1:03:00:: let down her golden hair---hair%1:08:00:: from beneath the crocketed spire---spire%1:06:00:: , even then we paid little heed---heed%1:09:00:: to those who went by on the path---path%1:06:00:: outside .
We enjoyed a paradoxical freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: when we were still too young for school---school%1:09:00:: .
In the heat---heat%1:09:00:: of the summer---summer%1:28:00:: , the garden---garden%1:06:01:: solitudes---solitude%1:26:00:: were ours alone ; our elders---elder%1:18:00:: stayed in the dark house---house%1:06:00:: or sat fanning on the front porch---front_porch%1:06:00:: .
They never troubled themselves about us while we were playing , because the fence---fence%1:06:00:: formed such a definite boundary---boundary%1:25:00:: and `` Do n't go outside the gate---gate%1:06:00:: '' was a command---command%1:10:00:: so impossible of misinterpretation---misinterpretation%1:10:00:: .
We were not , however , entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of the street---street%1:06:00:: .
We were forbidden to swing on the gates---gate%1:06:00:: , lest they sag on their hinges---hinge%1:06:00:: in a poor-white-trash---poor_white_trash%1:18:00:: way---way%1:07:01:: , but we could stand on them , when they were latched , rest our chins---chin%1:08:00:: on the top---top%1:15:00:: , and stare and stare , committing to memory---memory%1:09:01:: , quite unintentionally , all the details---detail%1:24:00:: that lay before our eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
The street---street%1:06:00:: that is full now of traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: and parked cars---car%1:06:00:: then and for many years---year%1:28:01:: drowsed on an August---august%1:28:00:: afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: in the shade---shade%1:26:00:: of the curbside---curbside%1:06:00:: trees---tree%1:20:00:: , and silence---silence%1:07:00:: was a weight---weight%1:06:00:: , almost palpable , in the air---air%1:15:00:: .
Every slight sound---sound%1:11:00:: that rose against that pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: fell away again , crushed beneath it .
A hay---hay%1:13:00:: wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: moved slowly along the gutter---gutter%1:06:00:: , the top---top%1:15:00:: of it swept by the low boughs---bough%1:20:00:: of the maple---maple%1:20:02:: trees---tree%1:20:00:: , and loose straws---straw%1:27:01:: were left hanging tangled among the leaves---leaf%1:20:00:: .
A wheel---wheel%1:06:00:: squeaked on a hub---hub%1:06:00:: , was still , and squeaked again .
If a child---child%1:18:00:: watched its progress---progress%1:11:00:: he whispered , `` Hay---hay%1:13:00:: , hay---hay%1:13:00:: , load---load%1:23:00:: of hay---hay%1:13:00:: - make a wish---wish%1:10:00:: and turn away '' , and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction---direction%1:15:00:: until the sound---sound%1:09:00:: of the horses---horse%1:05:00:: ' feet---foot%1:05:01:: returned no more .
When the hay---hay%1:13:00:: wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: had gone , and an interval---interval%1:28:00:: passed , a huckster---huckster%1:18:00:: 's cart---cart%1:06:00:: might turn the corner---corner%1:06:00:: .
The horse---horse%1:05:00:: walked , the reins---rein%1:06:00:: were slack , the huckster---huckster%1:18:00:: rode with bowed shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: , his forearms---forearm%1:08:00:: across his knees---knee%1:08:00:: .
Sleepily , as if half reluctant to break the silence---silence%1:07:00:: , he lifted his voice---voice%1:10:00:: : `` Rhu-beb---rhubarb%1:13:00:: ni ice fresh rhu-beb---rhubarb%1:13:00:: today---today%1:28:01:: '' !
The lazy sing-song---singsong%1:10:00:: was spaced in time---time%1:03:00:: like the drone---drone%1:10:00:: of a bumble-bee---bumblebee%1:05:00:: .
The horse---horse%1:05:00:: plodded on , and he repeated his call---call%1:10:02:: .
It became so monotonous as to seem a part---part%1:17:00:: of the quietness---quietness%1:07:00:: .
After his passage---passage%1:04:00:: , the street---street%1:06:00:: was empty again .
The sun---sun%1:17:00:: moved slant-wise across the sky---sky%1:17:00:: and down ; the trees---tree%1:20:00:: ' shadows---shadow%1:26:01:: circled from street---street%1:06:00:: to sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: , from sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: to lawn---lawn%1:15:00:: .
At four o ' clock , or four thirty , the coming---coming%1:04:01:: of the newsboy---newsboy%1:18:00:: marked the end---end%1:28:00:: of the day---day%1:28:04:: ; he tossed a paper---paper%1:10:03:: toward every front door---front_door%1:06:00:: , and housewives---housewife%1:18:00:: came down to their steps---steps%1:06:00:: to pick them up and read what their neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: had been doing .
The streets---street%1:06:00:: of any county---county%1:15:00:: town---town%1:15:00:: were like this on any sunshiny afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: in summer---summer%1:28:00:: ; they were like this fifty odd years---year%1:28:01:: ago , and yesterday---yesterday%1:28:01:: .
But the fences---fence%1:06:00:: were still in place fifty odd years---years%1:28:00:: ago , and when we stood on the gate---gate%1:06:00:: to look over , the sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: under our eyes---eye%1:08:00:: was not cement---cement%1:27:03:: but two rows---row%1:14:00:: of paving stones---paving_stone%1:06:00:: with grass---grass%1:20:00:: between and on both sides---side%1:15:02:: .
The curb---curb%1:06:00:: was a line---line%1:14:01:: of stone---stone%1:06:00:: laid edgewise in the dirt---dirt%1:27:01:: and tilted this way---way%1:15:00:: and that by frost---frost%1:27:00:: in the ground---ground%1:27:00:: or the roots---root%1:20:00:: of trees---tree%1:20:00:: .
Opposite every gate---gate%1:06:00:: was a hitching post---hitching_post%1:06:00:: or a stone---stone%1:27:00:: carriage---carriage%1:06:00:: step---step%1:06:00:: , set with a rusty iron---iron%1:27:00:: ring---ring%1:06:02:: for tying a horse---horse%1:05:00:: .
The street---street%1:06:00:: was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center---center%1:15:01:: ; it was mud---mud%1:27:00:: in wet weather---weather%1:19:00:: and dust---dust%1:27:00:: , ankle-deep , in dry , and could be crossed only at the corner---corner%1:06:00:: where there were stepping stones---stepping_stone%1:17:00:: .
It had a bucolic atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: that it has lost long since .
The hoofmarks of cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: and the prints---footprint%1:10:00:: of bare feet---foot%1:08:01:: in the mud---mud%1:27:00:: or in the dust---dust%1:27:00:: were as numerous as the traces---trace%1:06:00:: of shod horses---horse%1:05:00:: .
Cows---cows%1:05:00:: were kept in backyard---backyard%1:06:00:: barns---barn%1:06:00:: , boys---boy%1:18:00:: were hired to drive them to and from the pasture---pasture%1:15:00:: on the edge---edge%1:25:00:: of town---town%1:15:00:: , and familiar to the ear---ear%1:08:00:: , morning---morning%1:28:00:: and evening---evening%1:28:00:: , were the boys---boy%1:18:00:: ' coaxing voices---voice%1:10:00:: , the thud---thud%1:11:00:: of hooves---hoof%1:05:00:: , and the thwack---thwack%1:04:00:: of a stick---stick%1:20:00:: on cowhide---cowhide%1:27:00:: .
Important as was Mr. O' Donnell---person%1:03:00:: 's essay---essay%1:10:00:: , his thesis---thesis%1:10:00:: is so restricting as to deny Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: the stature---stature%1:26:00:: which he obviously has .
He and also Mr. Cowley---person%1:03:00:: and Mr. Warren---person%1:03:00:: have fallen to the temptation---temptation%1:09:00:: which besets many of us to read into our authors---author%1:18:00:: - Nathaniel Hawthorne---person%1:03:00:: , for example , and Herman Melville---herman_melville%1:18:00:: - protests---protest%1:10:00:: against modernism---modernism%1:06:00:: , material progress---progress%1:04:01:: , and science which are genuine protests---protest%1:10:00:: of our own but may not have been theirs .
Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: 's total works---work%1:06:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: , and in fact those of his works---work%1:06:00:: which existed in 1946 when Mr. Cowley---person%1:03:00:: made his comment---comment%1:10:00:: , or in 1939 , when Mr. O' Donnell---person%1:03:00:: wrote his essay---essay%1:10:00:: , reveal no such simple attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: toward the South---south%1:15:01:: .
If he is a traditionalist---traditionalist%1:18:00:: , he is an eclectic traditionalist---traditionalist%1:18:00:: .
If he condemns the recent or the present---present%1:28:00:: , he condemns the past---past%1:28:00:: with no less force---force%1:07:00:: .
If he sees the heroic in a Sartoris---person%1:03:00:: or a Sutpen---person%1:03:00:: , he sees also - and he shows - the blind and the mean , and he sees the Compson---person%1:03:00:: family---family%1:14:02:: disintegrating from within .
If the barn-burner---barnburner%1:18:00:: 's family---family%1:14:02:: produces a Flem Snopes---person%1:03:00:: , who personifies commercialism---commercialism%1:04:00:: and materialism---materialism%1:26:00:: in hyperbolic crassness---crassness%1:07:00:: , the Compson---person%1:03:00:: family---family%1:14:02:: produces a Jason Compson---person%1:03:00:: 4 , .
Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: is a most untraditional traditionalist---traditionalist%1:18:00:: .
Others writing on Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: have found the phrase---phrase%1:10:00:: `` traditional moralist---moralist%1:18:00:: '' either inadequate or misleading .
Among them are Frederick J. Hoffman---person%1:03:00:: , William Van O'Connor---person%1:03:00:: , and Mrs. Olga Vickery---person%1:03:00:: .
They have indicated the direction---direction%1:09:00:: but they have not been explicit enough , I believe , in pointing out Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: 's independence---independence%1:26:00:: , his questioning if not indeed challenging the Southern tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: .
Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: 's is not the mind---mind%1:09:00:: of the apologist---apologist%1:18:00:: which Mr. O' Donnell---person%1:03:00:: implies that it is .
He is not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body---body%1:14:02:: of social , cultural , or literary traditions---tradition%1:09:02:: than he was within the traditions---tradition%1:09:02:: - or possibly the regulations---regulation%1:10:00:: - governing his tenure---tenure%1:28:00:: in the post office---post_office%1:14:01:: at Oxford---location%1:03:00:: , Mississippi---mississippi%1:15:00:: , thirty-five years---year%1:28:01:: ago .
That is not to deny that he has been aware of traditions---tradition%1:09:02:: , of course , that he is steeped in them , in fact , or that he has dealt with them , in his books---book%1:10:00:: .
It is to say rather , I believe , that he has brought to bear on the history---history%1:28:00:: , the traditions---tradition%1:09:02:: , and the lore---lore%1:09:00:: of his region---region%1:15:00:: a critical , skeptical mind---mind%1:09:00:: - the same mind---mind%1:09:00:: which has made of him an inveterate experimenter---experimenter%1:18:00:: in literary form---form%1:09:00:: and technique---technique%1:09:00:: .
He has employed from his section---section%1:15:01:: rich immediate materials---material%1:10:00:: which in a loose sense---sense%1:10:00:: can be termed Southern .
The fact---fact%1:10:01:: that he has cast over those materials---material%1:10:00:: the light---light%1:09:01:: of a skeptical mind---mind%1:09:00:: does not make him any the less Southern , I rather think , for the South---south%1:15:01:: has been no more solid than other regions---region%1:15:00:: except in the political and related areas---area%1:09:00:: where patronage---patronage%1:04:00:: and force---force%1:07:00:: and intimidation---intimidation%1:04:01:: and fear---fear%1:12:00:: may produce a surface uniformity---uniformity%1:07:01:: .
Some of us might be inclined to argue , in fact , that an independence---independence%1:26:00:: of mind---mind%1:09:00:: and action---action%1:04:02:: and an intolerance---intolerance%1:07:02:: of regimentation---regimentation%1:04:00:: , either mental or physical , are particularly Southern traits---trait%1:07:00:: .
There is no necessity---necessity%1:26:00:: , I suppose , to assert that Mr. Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: is Southern .
It would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly Southern pedigree---pedigree%1:14:00:: than that of his family---family%1:18:00:: .
And , after all , he has lived comfortably at both Oxford---location%1:03:00:: , Mississippi---mississippi%1:15:00:: , and Charlottesville---location%1:03:00:: , Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: .
The young William Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: in New Orleans---new_orleans%1:15:00:: in the 1920 's impressed the novelist---novelist%1:18:00:: Hamilton Basso---person%1:03:00:: as obviously conscious of being a Southerner---southerner%1:18:00:: , and there is no evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that since then he has ever considered himself any less so .
Besides showing no inclination---inclination%1:09:00:: , apparently , to absent himself from his native region---region%1:15:00:: even for short periods---period%1:28:00:: , and in addition writing a shelf---shelf%1:06:00:: of books---book%1:10:00:: set in the region---region%1:15:00:: , he has handled in those books---book%1:10:00:: an astonishingly complete list---list%1:10:00:: of matters---matter%1:09:00:: which have been important in the South---south%1:15:01:: during the past hundred years---year%1:28:01:: .
It is more difficult with Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: than with most authors---author%1:18:00:: to say what is the extent---extent%1:07:00:: and what is the source---source%1:09:00:: of his knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: .
His own testimony---testimony%1:10:01:: is that he has read very little in the history---history%1:09:00:: of the South---south%1:15:01:: , implying that what he knows of that history---history%1:09:00:: has come to him orally and that he knows the world---world%1:17:01:: around him primarily from his own unassisted observation---observation%1:04:00:: .
His denials---denial%1:10:01:: of extensive reading---reading%1:09:00:: notwithstanding , it is no doubt safe to assume that he has spent time---time%1:28:05:: schooling himself in Southern history---history%1:09:00:: and that he has gained some acquaintance---acquaintance%1:09:00:: with the chief literary authors---author%1:18:00:: who have lived in the South---south%1:15:01:: or have written about the South---south%1:15:01:: .
But in looking at Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: against his background---background%1:07:00:: in Mississippi---mississippi%1:15:00:: and the South---south%1:15:01:: , it is important not to lose the broader perspective---perspective%1:09:00:: .
His earliest work---work%1:06:00:: reflected heavy influences---influence%1:07:00:: from English and continental writers---writer%1:18:00:: .
Evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: is plentiful that early and later also he has been indebted to the Gothic romancers---gothic_romancer%1:18:00:: , who deal in extravagant horror---horror%1:12:01:: , to the symbolists---symbolist%1:18:00:: writing at the end---end%1:28:00:: of the preceding century---century%1:28:00:: , and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness---stream_of_consciousness%1:10:00:: novelists---novelist%1:18:00:: , Henry James---henry_james%1:18:00:: and James Joyce---person%1:03:00:: among them .
His repeated experimentation---experimentation%1:04:00:: with the techniques---technique%1:09:00:: of fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: testifies to an independence---independence%1:26:00:: of mind---mind%1:09:00:: and an originality---originality%1:09:00:: of approach---approach%1:04:02:: , but it also shows him touching at many points---point%1:15:00:: the stream---stream%1:14:00:: of literary development---development%1:22:02:: back of him .
My intention---intention%1:09:00:: , therefore , is not to say that Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: 's awareness---awareness%1:09:00:: has been confined within the borders---border%1:25:00:: of the South---south%1:15:01:: , but rather that he has looked at his world---world%1:09:00:: as a Southerner---southerner%1:18:00:: and that presumably his outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: is Southern .
The ingredients---ingredient%1:09:00:: of Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: 's novels---novel%1:10:00:: and stories---story%1:10:00:: are by no means new with him , and most of the problems---problem%1:26:00:: he takes up have had the attention---attention%1:09:00:: of authors---author%1:18:00:: before him .
A useful comment---comment%1:10:00:: on his relation---relation%1:03:00:: to his region---region%1:15:00:: may be made , I think , by noting briefly how in handling Southern materials---material%1:10:00:: and Southern problems---problem%1:26:00:: he has deviated from the pattern---pattern%1:09:03:: set by other Southern authors---author%1:18:00:: while remaining faithful to the essential character---character%1:07:01:: of the region---region%1:15:00:: .
The planter---planter%1:18:00:: aristocracy---aristocracy%1:14:02:: has appeared in literature---literature%1:10:00:: at least since John Pendleton Kennedy---person%1:03:00:: published Swallow-Barn in 1832 and in his genial portrait---portrait%1:10:00:: of Frank Meriwether---person%1:03:00:: presiding over his plantation---plantation%1:21:00:: dominion initiated the most persistent tradition---tradition%1:09:02:: of Southern literature---literature%1:10:00:: .
The thoroughgoing idealization---idealization%1:04:00:: of the planter---planter%1:18:00:: society---society%1:14:00:: did not come , however , until after the Civil War---civil_war%1:04:00:: when Southern writers---writer%1:18:00:: were eager to defend a way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: which had been destroyed .
As they looked with nostalgia to a society---society%1:14:00:: which had been swept away , they were probably no more than half conscious that they painted in colors which had never existed .
Their books---book%1:10:00:: found no less willing readers---reader%1:18:02:: outside than inside the South---south%1:15:01:: , even while memories---memory%1:09:02:: of the war---war%1:04:00:: were still sharp .
The tradition---tradition%1:09:02:: reached its apex---apex%1:15:00:: , perhaps , in the works---work%1:06:00:: of Thomas Nelson Page---person%1:03:00:: toward the end---end%1:28:00:: of the century---century%1:28:00:: , and reappeared undiminished as late as 1934 in the best-selling novel---novel%1:10:00:: So Red the Rose , by Stark Young---person%1:03:00:: .
Although Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: was the heir---heir%1:18:00:: in his own family---family%1:14:04:: to this tradition---tradition%1:09:02:: , he did not have Stark Young---person%1:03:00:: 's inclination---inclination%1:09:00:: to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter---planter%1:18:00:: society---society%1:14:00:: .
The myth---myth%1:10:00:: of the Southern plantation---plantation%1:21:00:: has had only a tangential relation---relation%1:03:00:: with actuality---actuality%1:26:00:: , as Francis Pendleton Gaines---person%1:03:00:: showed forty years---year%1:28:01:: ago , and I suspect it has had a far narrower acceptance---acceptance%1:09:00:: as something real than has generally been supposed .
Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: has found it useful , but he has employed it with his habitual independence---independence%1:26:00:: of mind---mind%1:09:00:: and skeptical outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: .
Without saying or seeming to say that in portraying the Sartoris---person%1:03:00:: and the Compson---person%1:03:00:: families---family%1:14:02:: Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: 's chief concern---concern%1:09:00:: is social criticism---criticism%1:10:00:: , we can say nevertheless that through those families---family%1:14:02:: he dramatizes his comment---comment%1:10:00:: on the planter---planter%1:18:00:: dynasties---dynasty%1:14:00:: as they have existed since the decades---decade%1:28:00:: before the Civil War---civil_war%1:04:00:: .
It may be that in this comment---comment%1:10:00:: he has broken from the conventional pattern---pattern%1:09:03:: more violently than in any other regard---regard%1:09:00:: , for the treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: in his books---book%1:10:00:: is far removed from even the genial irony---irony%1:10:01:: of Ellen Glasgow---person%1:03:00:: , who was the only important novelist---novelist%1:18:00:: before him to challenge the conventional picture---picture%1:09:00:: of planter---planter%1:18:00:: society---society%1:14:00:: .
Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: 's low-class characters---character%1:18:02:: had but few counterparts---counterpart%1:06:00:: in earlier Southern novels---novel%1:10:00:: dealing with plantation---plantation%1:21:00:: life---life%1:26:01:: .
They have an ancestry---ancestry%1:14:00:: extending back , however , at least to 1728 , when William Byrd---person%1:03:00:: described the Lubberlanders---person%1:03:00:: he encountered in the back country---back_country%1:15:00:: of Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: and North Carolina---north_carolina%1:15:00:: .
The chief literary antecedents---antecedent%1:18:00:: of the Snopes---person%1:03:00:: clan---clan%1:14:00:: appeared in the realistic , humorous writing---writing%1:10:00:: which originated in the South---south%1:15:01:: and the Southwest---southwest%1:15:00:: in the three decades---decade%1:28:00:: before the Civil War---civil_war%1:04:00:: .
These narratives---narrative%1:10:00:: of coarse action---action%1:04:02:: and crude language---language%1:10:00:: appeared first in local newspapers---newspaper%1:10:00:: , as a rule---rule%1:09:01:: , and later found their way---way%1:04:00:: between book---book%1:06:00:: covers---cover%1:06:02:: , though rarely into the planters---planter%1:18:00:: ' libraries---library%1:14:00:: beside the morocco---morocco%1:27:00:: bound volumes---volume%1:06:00:: of Horace---person%1:03:00:: , Mr. Addison---person%1:03:00:: , Mr. Pope---person%1:03:00:: , and Sir Walter Scott---person%1:03:00:: .
There is evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: to suggest , in fact , that many authors---author%1:18:00:: of the humorous sketches---sketch%1:10:03:: were prompted to write them - or to make them as indelicate as they are - by way---way%1:04:01:: of protesting against the artificial refinements---refinement%1:26:00:: which had come to dominate the polite letters---letters%1:09:00:: of the South---south%1:15:01:: .
William Gilmore Simms---person%1:03:00:: , sturdy realist---realist%1:18:00:: that he was , pleaded for a natural robustness---robustness%1:07:00:: such as he found in his favorites---favorite%1:09:00:: the great Elizabethans---elizabethan%1:18:00:: , to vivify the pale writings---writing%1:10:00:: being produced around him .
Simms---person%1:03:00:: admired the raucous tales---tale%1:10:00:: emanating from the backwoods---backwoods%1:15:00:: , but he had himself social affiliations---affiliation%1:26:00:: which would not allow him to approve them fully .
Augustus Baldwin Longstreet---person%1:03:00:: , a preacher---preacher%1:18:00:: and a college---college%1:14:00:: and university---university%1:14:00:: president---president%1:18:02:: in four Southern states---state%1:15:01:: , published the earliest of these backwoods---backwoods%1:15:00:: sketches---sketch%1:10:03:: and in the character---character%1:18:02:: Ransy Sniffle---person%1:03:00:: , in the accounts---account%1:10:00:: of sharp horse-trading---horse_trading%1:04:00:: and eye---eye%1:08:00:: gouging physical combat---combat%1:04:00:: , and in the shockingly unliterary speech---speech%1:10:00:: of his characters---character%1:18:02:: , he set an example---example%1:09:00:: followed by many after him .
Others who wrote of low characters---character%1:18:02:: and low life---life%1:26:01:: included Thomas Bangs Thorpe---person%1:03:00:: , creator---creator%1:18:00:: of the Big Bear---person%1:03:00:: of Arkansas---arkansas%1:15:00:: and Tom Owen---person%1:03:00:: , the Bee-Hunter---person%1:03:00:: ; Johnson Jones Hooper---person%1:03:00:: , whose character---character%1:18:02:: Simon Suggs---person%1:03:00:: bears a close kinship---kinship%1:24:02:: to Flem Snopes---person%1:03:00:: in both his willingness---willingness%1:07:00:: to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness---sharpness%1:09:01:: with which he habitually carried out his will---will%1:09:01:: ; and George Washington Harris---person%1:03:00:: , whose Tennessee---tennessee%1:15:00:: hillbilly---hillbilly%1:18:00:: character---character%1:18:02:: Sut Lovingood---person%1:03:00:: perpetrated more unmalicious mischief---mischief%1:04:00:: and more unintended pain---pain%1:12:00:: than any other character---character%1:18:02:: in literature---literature%1:10:00:: .
It would be profitable , I believe , to read these realistic humorists---humorist%1:18:00:: alongside Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: 's works---work%1:09:00:: , the thought---thought%1:09:01:: being not that he necessarily read them and owed anything to them directly , but rather that they dealt a hundred years---year%1:28:01:: ago with a class---class%1:14:01:: of people---people%1:14:00:: and a type---type%1:09:00:: of life---life%1:26:01:: which have continued down to our time---time%1:28:00:: , to Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: 's time---time%1:28:00:: .
Such a comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: reminds us that in employing low characters---character%1:18:02:: in his works---work%1:06:00:: Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: is recording actuality---actuality%1:26:00:: in the South---south%1:15:01:: and moreover is following a long established literary precedent---precedent%1:09:00:: .
Such characters---character%1:18:02:: , with their low existence---existence%1:26:00:: and often low morality---morality%1:16:00:: , produce humorous effects---effect%1:19:00:: in his novels---novel%1:10:00:: and tales---tale%1:10:00:: , as they did in the writing---writing%1:10:00:: of Longstreet---person%1:03:00:: and Hooper---person%1:03:00:: and Harris---person%1:03:00:: , but it need not be added that he gives them far subtler and more intricate functions---function%1:07:00:: than they had in the earlier writers---writer%1:18:00:: ; nor is there need---need%1:17:00:: to add that among them are some of the most highly individualized and most successful of his characters---character%1:18:02:: .
One of the early humorists---humorist%1:18:00:: already mentioned , Thomas Bangs Thorpe---person%1:03:00:: , can be used to illustrate another point---point%1:15:00:: where Faulkner---person%1:03:00:: touches authentic Southern materials---material%1:27:00:: and also earlier literary treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: of those materials---material%1:27:00:: .
Thorpe---person%1:03:00:: came to Louisiana---louisiana%1:15:00:: from the East---east%1:15:01:: as a young man---man%1:18:00:: prepared to find in the new country---country%1:15:00:: the setting---setting%1:15:00:: of romantic adventure---adventure%1:04:00:: and idealized beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: .
But Thorpe---person%1:03:00:: saw also the hardships---hardship%1:07:00:: of pioneer---pioneer%1:18:00:: existence---existence%1:26:00:: , the cultural poverty---poverty%1:26:00:: of the frontier settlements---frontier_settlement%1:14:00:: , and the slack morality---morality%1:16:00:: which abounded in the new regions---region%1:15:00:: .
As a consequence---consequence%1:11:00:: of the tensions---tension%1:26:03:: thus produced in his thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: and feelings---feelings%1:12:00:: , he wrote on the one hand sketches---sketch%1:10:03:: of idealized hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: trips---trip%1:04:00:: and on the other an anecdote---anecdote%1:10:00:: of the village---village%1:14:00:: of Hardscrabble---location%1:03:00:: , Arkansas---arkansas%1:15:00:: , where no one had ever seen a piano---piano%1:06:00:: ; and he wrote also the masterpiece---masterpiece%1:06:00:: of frontier humor---humor%1:10:00:: , `` The Big Bear of Arkansas '' , in which earthy realism---realism%1:07:00:: is placed alongside the exaggeration---exaggeration%1:10:01:: of the backwoods---backwoods%1:15:00:: tall-tale---tall_tale%1:10:00:: and the awe---awe%1:12:02:: with which man contemplates the grandeur---grandeur%1:07:01:: and the mysteries---mystery%1:09:00:: of nature---nature%1:17:00:: .
Farming---farming%1:04:00:: is confining .
The farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: 's life---life%1:26:02:: must be arranged to meet the demands---demand%1:09:00:: of crops---crop%1:20:00:: and livestock---livestock%1:05:00:: .
Livestock---livestock%1:05:00:: must be tended every day , routinely .
A slight change---change%1:11:00:: in the work---work%1:04:00:: schedule---schedule%1:09:00:: may cut the production---production%1:04:00:: of cows---cow%1:05:01:: or chickens---chicken%1:05:01:: .
Even if there are no livestock---livestock%1:05:00:: , the farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: cannot leave the farm---farm%1:06:00:: for long periods---period%1:28:00:: , particularly during the growing season---growing_season%1:28:00:: .
The worker---worker%1:18:00:: who lives on a farm---farm%1:06:00:: cannot change jobs---job%1:04:00:: readily .
He cannot leave the farm---farm%1:06:00:: to take work---work%1:04:01:: in another locality---locality%1:15:00:: on short notice---notice%1:10:03:: ; such a move---move%1:04:01:: may mean a loss---loss%1:21:01:: of capital---capital%1:21:01:: .
Hard physical labor---labor%1:04:00:: and undesirable hours---hours%1:28:00:: are a part---part%1:04:01:: of farm---farm%1:06:00:: life---life%1:26:01:: .
The farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: must get up early , and , at times , work late at night---night%1:28:00:: .
Frequently he must work long hours---hours%1:28:00:: in the hot sun---sun%1:17:00:: or cold rain---rain%1:19:00:: .
No matter how well work---work%1:04:00:: is planned , bad weather---bad_weather%1:26:00:: or unexpected setbacks---setback%1:11:01:: can cause extra work---work%1:04:00:: that must be caught up .
It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: to own the labor-saving machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: that a full-time farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: can invest in profitably .
Production---production%1:06:00:: may fall far below expectations---expectation%1:09:00:: .
Drought---drought%1:26:00:: , hail---hail%1:19:00:: , disease---disease%1:26:00:: , and insects---insect%1:05:00:: take their toll of crops---crop%1:20:00:: .
Sickness---sickness%1:26:00:: or loss---loss%1:21:01:: of some of the livestock---livestock%1:05:00:: may cut into the owner---owner%1:18:00:: 's earnings---earnings%1:21:01:: , even into his capital---capital%1:21:01:: .
Returns---return%1:21:00:: for money---money%1:21:02:: and labor---labor%1:04:00:: invested may be small even in a good year---year%1:28:01:: .
The high cost---cost%1:21:00:: of land---land%1:17:01:: , supplies , and labor---labor%1:14:00:: make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis---basis%1:24:00:: .
Land---land%1:17:01:: within commuting distance---distance%1:07:00:: of a growing city---city%1:15:00:: is usually high in price---price%1:07:00:: , higher if it has subdivision---subdivision%1:04:00:: possibilities---possibility%1:09:03:: .
Part-time farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: generally must pay higher prices---price%1:07:00:: for supplies than full-time farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: because they buy in smaller quantities---quantity%1:03:00:: .
If the farm---farm%1:06:00:: is in an industrial area---area%1:15:01:: where wages---wage%1:21:00:: are high , farm---farm%1:06:00:: labor---labor%1:14:00:: costs---cost%1:21:00:: will also be high .
A part-time farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: needs unusual skill---skill%1:09:01:: to get as high production---production%1:06:00:: per hen---hen%1:05:01:: , per cow---cow%1:05:01:: , or per acre---acre%1:23:00:: as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: .
It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: .
He may have to depend upon custom service---service%1:04:08:: for specialized operations , such as spraying---spraying%1:04:03:: or threshing---threshing%1:04:00:: , and for these , he may have to wait his turn---turn%1:04:06:: .
There will be losses---loss%1:21:00:: caused by emergencies---emergency%1:11:00:: that arise while he is away at his off farm job---job%1:04:00:: .
The farm---farm%1:06:00:: may be an additional burden---burden%1:09:01:: if the main job---job%1:04:00:: is lost .
This may be true whether the farm---farm%1:06:00:: is owned or rented .
If the farm---farm%1:06:00:: is rented , the rent---rent%1:21:00:: must be paid .
If it is owned , taxes---tax%1:21:00:: must be paid , and if the place---place%1:15:04:: is not free of mortgage---mortgage%1:21:00:: , there will be interest---interest%1:21:00:: and payments---payment%1:21:00:: on the principal---principal%1:21:01:: to take care of .
A farm---farm%1:06:00:: provides a wholesome and healthful environment---environment%1:26:00:: for children---child%1:18:00:: .
It gives them room---room%1:23:00:: to play and plenty---plenty%1:23:00:: of fresh air---air%1:27:00:: .
The children---child%1:18:00:: can do chores---chore%1:04:00:: adapted to their age---age%1:07:00:: and ability---ability%1:09:00:: .
Caring for a calf---calf%1:05:00:: , a pig---pig%1:05:00:: , or some chickens---chicken%1:05:01:: develops in children---child%1:18:00:: a sense of responsibility---sense_of_responsibility%1:09:00:: for work---work%1:04:00:: .
Part-time farming---farming%1:04:00:: gives a measure of security---security%1:21:01:: if the regular job---job%1:04:00:: is lost , provided the farm---farm%1:06:00:: is owned free of debt---debt%1:21:00:: and furnishes enough income---income%1:21:00:: to meet fixed expenses---expense%1:21:00:: and minimum living costs---cost%1:21:00:: .
For some retired persons---retired_person%1:18:00:: , part-time farming---farming%1:04:00:: is a good way---way%1:04:01:: to supplement retirement---retirement%1:26:00:: income---income%1:21:00:: .
It is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health---health%1:26:00:: .
Generally , the same level---level%1:07:00:: of living---living%1:26:00:: costs less in the country---country%1:15:01:: than in the city---city%1:15:00:: .
The savings---saving%1:04:00:: are not as great , however , as is sometime supposed .
Usually , the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of food---food%1:03:00:: and shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: will be somewhat less on the farm---farm%1:06:00:: and the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of transportation---transportation%1:04:00:: and utilities---utility%1:04:00:: somewhat more .
Where schools---school%1:14:00:: , fire---fire%1:11:00:: and police---police%1:14:00:: protection---protection%1:04:00:: , and similar municipal services---services%1:04:00:: are of equal quality---quality%1:07:02:: in city---city%1:15:00:: and country---country%1:15:01:: , real estate---real_estate%1:21:00:: taxes---tax%1:21:00:: are usually about the same .
A part-time farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: and his family---family%1:14:02:: can use their spare time---spare_time%1:28:00:: profitably .
Some persons---person%1:03:00:: consider the work---work%1:04:00:: on a farm---farm%1:06:00:: recreational .
For some white-collar workers---worker%1:18:00:: it is a welcome change---change%1:11:00:: from the regular job---job%1:04:00:: , and a physical conditioner---conditioner%1:04:00:: .
Part-time farming---farming%1:04:00:: can take comparatively little land---land%1:17:01:: , labor---labor%1:14:00:: , and equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: - or a great deal---great_deal%1:23:00:: .
It depends on the kind---kind%1:09:00:: and the scale---scale%1:24:00:: of the farming---farming%1:04:00:: operation---operation%1:04:06:: .
General requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: for land---land%1:17:01:: , labor---labor%1:14:00:: , and equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: are discussed below .
Specific requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: for each of various types---type%1:09:00:: of enterprises---enterprise%1:04:00:: are discussed on pages---page%1:10:00:: 8 to 14 .
Three quarters---quarter%1:23:01:: to 1 acre---acre%1:23:00:: of good land---land%1:17:01:: is enough for raising fruits---fruit%1:20:00:: and vegetables---vegetable%1:13:00:: for home---home%1:15:04:: use---use%1:04:00:: , and for a small flock---flock%1:14:00:: of chickens---chicken%1:05:01:: , a cow---cow%1:05:01:: , and two pigs---pig%1:05:00:: .
You could not , of course , raise feed---feed%1:13:00:: for the livestock---livestock%1:05:00:: on a plot---plot%1:15:00:: this small .
If you want to raise feed---feed%1:13:00:: or carry out some enterprise---enterprise%1:04:00:: on a larger scale---scale%1:24:00:: , you 'll need more land---land%1:17:01:: .
In deciding how much land---land%1:17:01:: you want , take into account the amount---amount%1:07:00:: you 'll need to bring in the income---income%1:21:00:: you expect .
But consider also how much you and your family---family%1:14:02:: can keep up along with your other work---work%1:04:01:: .
The cost---cost%1:21:00:: of land---land%1:17:01:: and the prospects---prospect%1:26:00:: for appreciation---appreciation%1:04:01:: in value---value%1:21:00:: may influence your decision---decision%1:09:00:: .
Some part-time farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: buy more land---land%1:17:01:: than they need in anticipation---anticipation%1:09:00:: of suburban development---development%1:04:02:: .
This is a highly speculative venture---venture%1:21:00:: .
Sometimes a desired acreage---acreage%1:07:00:: is offered only as part---part%1:24:00:: of a larger tract---tract%1:15:00:: .
When surplus land---land%1:17:01:: is not expensive to buy or to keep up , it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage---acreage%1:07:00:: that the development---development%1:04:02:: of adjoining properties---property%1:15:00:: might impair the residential value---value%1:21:00:: of the farm---farm%1:06:00:: .
If you have a year-round , full-time job---job%1:04:00:: you can n't expect to grow much more than your family---family%1:14:02:: uses - unless other members---member%1:18:00:: of the family---family%1:14:02:: do a good deal---good_deal%1:23:00:: of the work---work%1:04:00:: or you hire help---help%1:18:00:: .
As a rule---rule%1:09:01:: , part-time farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: hire little help---help%1:18:00:: .
In deciding on the enterprises---enterprise%1:04:00:: to be managed by family---family%1:14:02:: labor---labor%1:04:00:: , compare the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of labor---labor%1:04:00:: that can be supplied by the family---family%1:14:02:: with the labor---labor%1:04:00:: needs---need%1:17:00:: of various enterprises---enterprise%1:04:00:: listed in table---table%1:14:00:: 1 .
List the number---number%1:07:00:: of hours---hour%1:28:00:: the family---family%1:14:02:: can be expected to work each month .
You may want to include your own regular vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: if you have one .
Do not include all your spare time---spare_time%1:28:00:: or all your family---family%1:14:02:: 's spare time---spare_time%1:28:00:: - only what you are willing to use for farm---farm%1:06:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: .
If you are going to produce for home---home%1:15:04:: use---use%1:04:00:: only , you will need only hand tools---hand_tool%1:06:00:: .
You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing---plowing%1:04:00:: , however .
For larger plantings---planting%1:04:00:: , you 'll need some kind---kind%1:09:00:: of power---power%1:19:00:: for plowing , harrowing , disking , and cultivating .
If you have a planting---planting%1:04:00:: of half---half%1:23:00:: an acre---acre%1:23:00:: or more you may want to buy a small garden---garden%1:06:00:: tractor---tractor%1:06:00:: ( available for $ 300 to $ 500 with attachments---attachment%1:06:00:: , 1960 prices---price%1:07:00:: ) .
These tractors---tractor%1:06:00:: are not entirely satisfactory for plowing , particularly on heavier soils---soil%1:17:00:: , so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing---plowing%1:04:00:: .
Cost---cost%1:21:00:: of power---power%1:19:00:: and machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: is often a serious problem---problem%1:26:00:: to the small-scale farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: .
If you are going to farm for extra cash---cash%1:21:00:: income---income%1:21:00:: on a part-time basis---basis%1:24:00:: you must keep in mind---mind%1:09:01:: the needed machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: investments---investment%1:21:00:: when you choose among farm enterprises---enterprise%1:04:00:: .
You can keep your machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: investment---investment%1:21:00:: down by buying good secondhand machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: , by sharing the cost---cost%1:21:00:: and upkeep---upkeep%1:04:00:: of machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: with a neighbor---neighbor%1:18:00:: , and by hiring someone with machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: to do certain jobs---job%1:04:01:: .
If an expensive and specialized piece---piece%1:06:05:: of machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: is needed - such as a spray---spray%1:27:01:: rig---rig%1:06:00:: , a combine---combine%1:06:00:: , or a binder---binder%1:06:03:: - it is better to pay someone with a machine---machine%1:06:00:: to do the work---work%1:04:00:: .
Before you look for a farm---farm%1:06:00:: you 'll need to know ( 1---1%1:23:00:: ) the kind---kind%1:09:00:: and scale---scale%1:24:00:: of farming---farming%1:04:00:: you want to undertake ; and ( 2---2%1:23:00:: ) whether you want to buy or rent .
Information---information%1:09:00:: on pages---page%1:10:00:: 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind---kind%1:09:00:: and scale---scale%1:24:00:: of your farming---farming%1:04:00:: venture---venture%1:04:01:: .
If you are not well acquainted with the area---area%1:15:01:: in which you wish to locate , or if you are not sure that you and your family---family%1:14:02:: will like and make a success---success%1:11:00:: of farming---farming%1:04:00:: , usually you would do better to rent a place---place%1:15:04:: for a year---year%1:28:01:: or two before you buy .
Discussed below are some of the main things---thing%1:07:00:: to look for when you select a part-time farm---farm%1:06:00:: .
Choose a location---location%1:03:00:: within easy commuting---commuting%1:04:00:: distance---distance%1:07:00:: of both the regular job---job%1:04:00:: and other employment---employment%1:04:00:: opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: .
Then if you change jobs---job%1:04:00:: you won n't necessarily have to sell the farm---farm%1:06:00:: .
The presence---presence%1:26:00:: of alternative job---job%1:04:00:: opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: also will make the place---place%1:15:04:: easier to sell if that should become desirable .
Obviously the farm---farm%1:06:00:: should be on an all weather---weather%1:19:00:: road---road%1:06:00:: .
If you grow anything to sell you will need markets---market%1:06:00:: nearby .
If you plan to sell fresh vegetables---vegetable%1:13:00:: or whole milk---milk%1:13:01:: , for example , you should be close to a town---town%1:15:00:: or city---city%1:15:00:: .
Look for a farm---farm%1:06:00:: in a neighborhood---neighborhood%1:14:00:: of well-kept homes---home%1:06:00:: .
There are slums---slum%1:15:00:: in the country---country%1:15:01:: as well as in the city---city%1:15:00:: .
Few rural areas---rural_area%1:15:00:: are protected by zoning---zoning%1:04:00:: .
A tavern---tavern%1:06:00:: , filling station---filling_station%1:06:00:: , junk yard---junkyard%1:15:00:: , rendering plant---plant%1:06:01:: , or some other business---business%1:14:00:: may go up near enough to hurt your home---home%1:15:04:: or to hurt its value---value%1:21:00:: .
Check on the schools---school%1:14:00:: in the area---area%1:15:01:: , the quality---quality%1:07:02:: of teaching---teaching%1:04:00:: , and the provision---provision%1:04:01:: for transportation---transportation%1:04:00:: to and from them .
Find out whether fire---fire%1:11:00:: protection---protection%1:04:00:: , sewage system---sewage_system%1:06:00:: , gas---gas%1:27:02:: , water mains---water_main%1:06:00:: , and electrical lines---line%1:06:01:: are available in the locality---locality%1:15:00:: .
If these facilities---facility%1:06:00:: are not at the door---door%1:06:01:: , getting them may cost more than you expect .
You cannot get along without an adequate supply---supply%1:23:00:: of pure water---water%1:27:00:: .
If you are considering a part-time farm---farm%1:06:00:: where the water---water%1:27:00:: must be provided by a well---well%1:06:00:: , find out if there is a good well---well%1:06:00:: on the farm---farm%1:06:00:: or the probable cost---cost%1:07:00:: of having one drilled .
A pond---pond%1:17:00:: may provide adequate water---water%1:27:00:: for livestock---livestock%1:05:00:: and garden---garden%1:14:00:: .
Pond---pond%1:17:00:: water---water%1:27:00:: can be filtered for human---human%1:05:00:: use---use%1:22:00:: , but most part-time farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: would not want to go to so much trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: .
The following amounts---amount%1:07:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: are needed per day---day%1:28:00:: for livestock---livestock%1:05:00:: and domestic uses---use%1:07:00:: .
Is the land---land%1:17:01:: suited to the crops---crop%1:20:00:: you intend to raise ?
If you can n't tell , get help---help%1:04:00:: from your county---county%1:15:00:: agricultural agent---agricultural_agent%1:18:00:: or other local specialist---specialist%1:18:00:: .
Soil---soil%1:17:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: , drainage---drainage%1:04:00:: , or degree---degree%1:07:00:: of slope---slope%1:17:00:: can make the difference---difference%1:07:00:: between good crops---crop%1:20:00:: and poor ones .
Small areas---area%1:15:01:: that are n't right for a certain crop---crop%1:20:00:: may lie next to areas---area%1:15:01:: that are well suited to that crop---crop%1:20:00:: .
Will the house---house%1:06:00:: on any part-time farm---farm%1:06:00:: you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence---residence%1:15:00:: ?
How much---much%1:23:00:: will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating ?
If the house---house%1:06:00:: is not wired adequately for electricity---electricity%1:19:01:: or if plumbing---plumbing%1:06:00:: or a central heating---central_heating%1:06:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: must be installed , check into the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of making these improvements---improvement%1:11:00:: .
Its worth---worth%1:07:00:: as a place---place%1:15:04:: to live .
The value---value%1:21:00:: of the products---product%1:06:01:: you can raise on it .
The possibilities---possibility%1:26:00:: of selling the property---property%1:15:00:: later on for suburban subdivision---subdivision%1:04:00:: .
Decide first what the place---place%1:15:04:: is worth to you and your family---family%1:14:02:: as a home---home%1:15:04:: in comparison---comparison%1:24:00:: with what it would cost to live in town---town%1:15:00:: .
Take into account the difference in city---city%1:15:00:: and county---county%1:15:00:: taxes---tax%1:21:00:: , insurance---insurance%1:21:02:: rates---rate%1:21:00:: , utility---utility%1:14:00:: rates---rate%1:21:00:: , and the cost---cost%1:07:00:: of travel---travel%1:04:00:: to work---work%1:04:01:: .
Next , estimate the value---value%1:21:00:: of possible earnings---earnings%1:21:01:: of the farm---farm%1:06:00:: .
To do this , set up a plan---plan%1:09:00:: on paper for operating the farm---farm%1:06:00:: .
List the kind---kind%1:09:00:: and quantity---quantity%1:03:00:: of things---things%1:21:00:: the farm---farm%1:06:00:: can be expected to produce in an average year---year%1:28:01:: .
Estimate the value---value%1:21:00:: of the produce---produce%1:13:00:: at normal prices---price%1:07:00:: .
The total---total%1:09:00:: is the probable gross income---income%1:21:00:: from farming---farming%1:04:00:: .
To find estimated net farm---farm%1:06:00:: income---income%1:21:00:: , subtract estimated annual farming---farming%1:04:00:: expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: from probable gross income---income%1:21:00:: from farming---farming%1:04:00:: .
Include as expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: an allowance---allowance%1:21:01:: for depreciation---depreciation%1:21:00:: of farm buildings---farm_building%1:06:00:: and equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: .
Also count as an expense---expense%1:21:00:: a charge---charge%1:21:02:: for the labor---labor%1:04:00:: to be contributed by the family---family%1:14:02:: .
It may be hard to decide what this labor---labor%1:04:00:: is worth , but charge something for it .
Otherwise , you may pay too much for the farm---farm%1:06:00:: and get nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: for your labor---labor%1:04:00:: .
To figure the value---value%1:21:00:: of the farm---farm%1:06:00:: in terms of investment---investment%1:21:00:: income---income%1:21:00:: , divide the estimated annual net farm---farm%1:06:00:: income---income%1:21:00:: by the percentage---percentage%1:21:00:: that you could expect to get in interest---interest%1:21:00:: if the money---money%1:21:02:: were invested in some other way---way%1:04:01:: .
Everyone with a personal or group tragedy---tragedy%1:11:00:: to relate had to be given his day---day%1:28:03:: in court---court%1:14:00:: as in some vast collective dirge---dirge%1:10:00:: .
For almost two months---month%1:28:01:: , the defendant---defendant%1:18:00:: and the world---world%1:14:02:: heard from individuals---individual%1:03:00:: escaped from the grave---grave%1:28:00:: about fathers---father%1:18:00:: and mothers---mother%1:18:00:: , graybeards---graybeard%1:18:00:: , adolescents---adolescent%1:18:00:: , babies---baby%1:18:00:: , starved , beaten to death---death%1:19:00:: , strangled , machine-gunned , gassed , burned .
One who had been a boy---boy%1:18:00:: in Auschwitz---location%1:03:00:: had to tell how children---child%1:18:00:: had been selected by height---height%1:07:01:: for the gas chambers---gas_chamber%1:06:00:: .
The gruesome humor---humor%1:07:01:: of the Nazis---nazi%1:18:00:: was not forgotten - the gas chamber---gas_chamber%1:06:00:: with a sign---sign%1:06:01:: on it with the name---name%1:10:00:: of a Jewish foundation---foundation%1:14:00:: and bearing a copper---copper%1:27:00:: Star of David---star_of_david%1:10:00:: - nor the gratuitous sadism---sadism%1:12:00:: of SS---group%1:03:00:: officers---officer%1:18:03:: .
Public relations---public_relations%1:10:00:: strategists---strategist%1:18:00:: everywhere , watching the reaction---reaction%1:09:00:: of the German press , the liberal press , the lunatic fringe press , listening to their neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: , studying interviews---interview%1:10:01:: with men---man%1:18:00:: and women---woman%1:18:00:: on the street---street%1:06:00:: , cried out : Too much , too much - the mind---mind%1:09:00:: of the audience---audience%1:14:01:: is becoming dulled , the horrors---horror%1:06:00:: are losing their effect---effect%1:10:00:: .
And still another witness---witness%1:18:00:: , one who had crawled out from under a heap---heap%1:14:00:: of corpses---corpse%1:08:00:: , had to tell how the victims---victim%1:18:00:: had been forced to lay themselves head---head%1:08:00:: to foot---foot%1:08:01:: one on top of the other before being shot .
Most of this testimony---testimony%1:10:00:: may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti---corpus_delicti%1:10:00:: of the total Nazi crime---crime%1:04:00:: but seemed subject to question---question%1:07:00:: when not tied to the part---part%1:09:02:: in it of the defendant---defendant%1:18:00:: 's Department of Jewish Affairs---group%1:03:00:: .
Counsel---counsel%1:18:00:: for the defense---defense%1:14:00:: , however , shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current---current%1:14:00:: of dreadful recollections---recollection%1:09:01:: , rarely raised an objection---objection%1:10:01:: .
Would not the emotional catharsis---catharsis%1:04:00:: eventually brought on by this awfulness---awfulness%1:07:00:: have a calming , if not exhausting , effect---effect%1:19:00:: likely to improve his client---client%1:18:00:: 's chances---chance%1:26:00:: ?
Those who feared `` emotionalism---emotionalism%1:07:00:: '' at the Trial showed less understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: than Dr. Servatius---person%1:03:00:: of the route---route%1:15:00:: by which man---man%1:18:04:: achieves the distance---distance%1:12:00:: necessary for fairness---fairness%1:07:00:: toward enemies---enemy%1:18:00:: .
Interruptions---interruption%1:04:00:: came largely from the bench---bench%1:14:00:: , which numerous times---time%1:11:00:: rebuked the Attorney General---attorney_general%1:18:00:: for letting his witnesses---witness%1:18:00:: run on , though it , too , made no serious effort---effort%1:04:00:: to choke off the flow---flow%1:14:00:: .
But there was a contrast---contrast%1:09:01:: even more decisive than a hunger---hunger%1:07:00:: for fact---fact%1:10:01:: between the Trial in Jerusalem---jerusalem%1:15:00:: and those in Moscow---moscow%1:15:00:: and New York---new_york%1:15:01:: .
In each of the last , the trial marked the beginning---beginning%1:04:00:: of a new course---course%1:14:00:: : in Moscow---moscow%1:15:00:: the liquidation---liquidation%1:04:01:: of the Old Bolsheviks---bolshevik%1:18:00:: and the tightening---tightening%1:04:00:: of Stalin---stalin%1:18:00:: 's dictatorship---dictatorship%1:14:00:: ; in the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: the initiation---initiation%1:04:01:: of militant anti Communism---communism%1:09:00:: , with the repentant ex Communist---communist%1:18:00:: in the vanguard---vanguard%1:14:00:: .
These trials were properly termed `` political cases---case%1:04:00:: '' in that the trial itself was a political act---act%1:03:00:: producing political consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: .
But what could the Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: Trial initiate ?
Of what new course---course%1:14:00:: could it mark the beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: ?
The Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: case---case%1:04:00:: looked to the past , not to the future---future%1:28:00:: .
It was the conclusion---conclusion%1:28:00:: of the first phase---phase%1:28:00:: of a process---process%1:09:00:: of tragic recollection---recollection%1:09:00:: , and of refining the recollection---recollection%1:09:00:: , that will last as long as there are Jews---jew%1:18:00:: .
As such , it was beyond politics---politics%1:24:00:: and had no need---need%1:17:00:: of justification---justification%1:09:00:: by a `` message---message%1:10:01:: '' .
`` It is not an individual---individual%1:03:00:: that is in the dock---dock%1:06:02:: at this historical trial '' - said Ben Gurion---person%1:03:00:: , `` and not the Nazi---nazi%1:18:00:: regime---regime%1:14:00:: alone - but anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: throughout history---history%1:28:02:: '' .
How could supplying Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: with a platform---platform%1:10:00:: on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder---murder%1:04:00:: of millions of Jews---jew%1:18:00:: without being an anti-Semite---anti-semite%1:18:00:: contribute to a verdict---verdict%1:04:00:: against anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: ?
And if it was not an individual---individual%1:03:00:: who was in the dock---dock%1:06:02:: , why was the Trial , as we shall observe later , all but scuttled in the attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to prove Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: a `` fiend---fiend%1:18:00:: '' ?
These questions---question%1:10:00:: touch the root---root%1:15:00:: of confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: in the prosecution---prosecution%1:14:00:: 's case---case%1:10:01:: .
It might be contended , of course , that Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: in stubbornly denying anti-Semitic feelings---feeling%1:09:03:: was lying or insisting on a private definition---definition%1:10:00:: of anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: .
But in either event---event%1:26:00:: he was the wrong man---man%1:18:00:: for the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of case---case%1:04:00:: outlined by Ben Gurion---person%1:03:00:: and set forth in the indictment---indictment%1:10:00:: .
In such a case---case%1:04:00:: the defendant---defendant%1:18:00:: should serve as a clear example---example%1:09:02:: and not have to be tied to the issue---issue%1:09:01:: by argument---argument%1:10:03:: .
In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue---issue%1:09:00:: by argument .
One who could be linked to anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: only by overcoming his objections---objection%1:04:01:: is scarcely a good specimen---specimen%1:09:00:: of the Jew-baiter---jew-baiter%1:18:00:: throughout the ages---age%1:28:02:: .
Shout at Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: though he might , the Prosecutor---prosecutor%1:18:00:: could not establish that the defendant---defendant%1:18:00:: was falsifying the way---way%1:26:00:: he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category---category%1:09:02:: of anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: .
Yes , he believed that the Jews---jew%1:18:00:: were `` enemies---enemy%1:14:01:: of the Reich---reich%1:14:00:: '' , and such a belief---belief%1:09:00:: is , of course , typical of `` patriotic '' anti-Semites---anti-semite%1:18:00:: ; but he believed in the Jew---jew%1:18:00:: as enemy---enemy%1:14:01:: in a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of abstract , theological way---way%1:07:01:: , like a member---member%1:18:00:: of a cult---cult%1:14:00:: speculating on the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of things---thing%1:09:00:: .
The real question---question%1:10:01:: was how one passed from anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: of this sort---sort%1:09:00:: to murder---murder%1:04:00:: , and the answer---answer%1:10:02:: to this question---question%1:10:00:: is not to be found in anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: itself .
In regard to Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: , it was to be found in the Nazi outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: , which contained a principle---principle%1:09:03:: separate from and far worse than anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: , a principle---principle%1:09:03:: by which the poison---poison%1:07:00:: of anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: itself was made more virulent .
Perhaps under the guidance---guidance%1:10:00:: of this Nazi principle---principle%1:09:03:: one could , as Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: declared , feel personally friendly toward the Jews---jew%1:18:00:: and still be their murderer---murderer%1:18:00:: .
Not through fear---fear%1:12:00:: of disobeying orders---order%1:10:03:: , as Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: kept trying to explain , but through a peculiar giddiness---giddiness%1:07:00:: that began in a half acceptance---acceptance%1:09:00:: of the vicious absurdities---absurdity%1:10:00:: contained in the Nazi interpretation---interpretation%1:09:01:: of history---history%1:09:01:: and grew with each of Hitler---hitler%1:18:00:: 's victories---victory%1:11:00:: into a permanent light mindedness---light-mindedness%1:07:00:: and sense---sense%1:09:05:: of magical rightness---rightness%1:07:00:: that was able to respond to any proposal---proposal%1:10:00:: , and the more outrageous the better , `` Well , let 's try it '' .
At any rate , the substance---substance%1:09:01:: of Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: 's testimony---testimony%1:10:00:: was that all his actions---action%1:04:02:: flowed from his membership---membership%1:26:00:: in the party---party%1:14:01:: and the SS---group%1:03:00:: , and though the Prosecutor---prosecutor%1:18:00:: did his utmost---utmost%1:07:00:: to prove actual personal hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: of Jews---jew%1:18:00:: , his success---success%1:04:00:: on this score---score%1:16:00:: was doubtful and the anti-Semitic lesson---lesson%1:10:00:: weakened to that extent .
But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania---mania%1:16:00:: so deadly to Jews---jew%1:18:00:: as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light , neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: of which the Nazis---nazi%1:18:00:: made such effective use---use%1:07:02:: in Germany---germany%1:15:00:: and wherever else they could find it .
If anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: was on trial in Jerusalem---jerusalem%1:15:00:: , why was it not identified , and with enough emphasis---emphasis%1:07:00:: to capture the notice---notice%1:09:00:: of the world---world%1:14:02:: press , in its connection---connection%1:24:00:: with the activities---activity%1:04:00:: of Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: 's Department of Jewish Affairs---group%1:03:00:: , as exemplified by the betrayal---betrayal%1:04:00:: and murder---murder%1:04:00:: of Jews---jew%1:18:00:: by non police---police%1:14:00:: and non-party anti-Semites---anti-semite%1:18:00:: in Germany---germany%1:15:00:: , as well as in Poland---poland%1:15:00:: , Czechoslovakia---czechoslovakia%1:15:00:: , Hungary---hungary%1:15:00:: ?
The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich---person%1:03:00:: in January---january%1:28:00:: 1942 , to organize the material---material%1:06:01:: and technical means---means%1:04:00:: to put to death the eleven million Jews---jew%1:18:00:: spread throughout the nations of Europe---europe%1:17:00:: , was attended by representatives---representative%1:18:02:: of major organs---organ%1:14:00:: of the German state---state%1:14:00:: , including the Reich Minister of the Interior---person%1:03:00:: , the State Secretary---person%1:03:00:: in charge of the Four Year Plan , the Reich Minister of Justice---person%1:03:00:: , the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs---person%1:03:00:: .
The measures---measure%1:04:01:: for annihilation---annihilation%1:04:00:: proposed and accepted at the Conference---conference%1:14:00:: affected industry---industry%1:04:00:: , transportation---transportation%1:06:00:: , civilian agencies---agency%1:14:00:: of government---government%1:14:00:: .
Heydrich---person%1:03:00:: , in opening the Conference---conference%1:14:00:: , followed the reasoning---reasoning%1:09:00:: and even the phraseology---phraseology%1:10:00:: of the order---order%1:10:00:: issued earlier by Goering---person%1:03:00:: which authorized the Final Solution as `` a complement---complement%1:07:00:: to '' previous `` solutions---solution%1:09:00:: '' for eliminating the Jews---jew%1:18:00:: from German living space---living_space%1:23:00:: through violence---violence%1:04:01:: , economic strangulation---economic_strangulation%1:04:00:: , forced emigration---emigration%1:04:00:: , and evacuation---evacuation%1:04:00:: .
In other words , the promulgators---promulgator%1:18:00:: of the murder---murder%1:04:00:: plan---plan%1:09:00:: made clear that physically exterminating the Jews---jew%1:18:00:: was but an extension---extension%1:04:02:: of the anti-Semitic measures---measure%1:04:01:: already operating in every phase---phase%1:28:00:: of German life---life%1:26:01:: , and that the new conspiracy---conspiracy%1:09:00:: counted on the general anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: that had made those measures---measure%1:04:01:: effective , as a readiness---readiness%1:07:01:: for murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
Since the magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: of the plan---plan%1:09:00:: made secrecy---secrecy%1:26:00:: impossible , once the wheels had began to turn , persons---person%1:03:00:: controlling German industries---industry%1:14:00:: , social institutions---institution%1:14:00:: , and armed forces---armed_forces%1:14:00:: became , through their anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: or their tolerance---tolerance%1:04:00:: of it , conscious accomplices---accomplice%1:18:00:: of Hitler---hitler%1:18:00:: 's crimes---crime%1:04:00:: ; whether in the last degree---degree%1:26:01:: or a lesser one was a matter---matter%1:09:00:: to be determined individually .
What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world---world%1:14:02:: against anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: than this opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to expose the exact link---link%1:06:00:: between the respectable anti-Semite---anti-semite%1:18:00:: and the concentration-camp---concentration_camp%1:06:00:: brute---brute%1:18:00:: ?
Not in Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: 's anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: but in the anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: of the sober German man of affairs---man_of_affairs%1:18:00:: lay the potential warning---warning%1:10:01:: of the Trial .
No doubt many of the citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: of the Third Reich---third_reich%1:14:00:: had conceived their anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: as an `` innocent '' dislike---dislike%1:09:00:: of Jews---jew%1:18:00:: , as do others like them today---today%1:28:00:: .
The Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter---jew-baiter%1:18:00:: of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality---criminality%1:26:00:: and madness---madness%1:26:00:: of others .
Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort---effort%1:04:00:: to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types---type%1:09:00:: of `` mere '' anti-Semites---anti-semite%1:18:00:: were drawn step by step into the program---program%1:09:00:: of skull---skull%1:08:00:: bashings---bash%1:11:00:: and gassings---gassing%1:04:00:: ?
The Prosecutor---prosecutor%1:18:00:: in his opening remarks---remark%1:10:00:: did refer to `` the germ---germ%1:09:00:: of anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: '' among the Germans---german%1:18:00:: which Hitler---hitler%1:18:00:: `` stimulated and transformed '' .
But if there was evidence---evidence%1:10:00:: at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: at his collaborators---collaborator%1:18:02:: in the societies---society%1:14:00:: where he functioned , the press seems to have missed it .
Nor did the Trial devote much attention---attention%1:04:01:: to exposing the usefulness---usefulness%1:07:00:: of anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: to the Nazis---nazi%1:18:00:: , both in building their own power---power%1:07:00:: and in destroying that of rival organizations---organization%1:14:01:: and states---state%1:14:00:: .
Certainly , one of the best ways---way%1:04:01:: of warning the world---world%1:14:02:: against anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: is to demonstrate its workings---workings%1:06:01:: as a dangerous weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: .
Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: himself is a model---model%1:09:02:: of how the myth---myth%1:10:00:: of the enemy Jew---jew%1:18:00:: can be used to transform the ordinary man---man%1:18:04:: of present-day society---society%1:14:00:: into a menace---menace%1:26:00:: to all his neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: .
Do patriots---patriot%1:18:00:: everywhere know enough about how the persecution---persecution%1:04:00:: of the Jews---jew%1:18:00:: in Germany---germany%1:15:00:: and later in the occupied countries---country%1:15:00:: contributed to terrorizing the populations---population%1:14:00:: , splitting apart individuals---individual%1:03:00:: and groups---group%1:03:00:: , arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses---impulse%1:16:00:: , pulverizing trust---trust%1:07:00:: and personal dignity---dignity%1:07:00:: , and finally forcing people---people%1:14:00:: to follow their masters---master%1:18:04:: into the abyss---abyss%1:17:00:: by making them partners---partner%1:18:00:: in unspeakable crimes---crime%1:04:00:: ?
The career---career%1:04:01:: of Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: made the Trial a potential showcase---showcase%1:26:00:: for anti-Semitic demoralization---demoralization%1:04:00:: :
fearful of being mistaken for a Jew---jew%1:18:00:: , he seeks protection---protection%1:21:00:: in his Nazi---nazi%1:18:00:: uniform---uniform%1:06:00:: ; clinging to the enemy Jew---jew%1:18:00:: idea---idea%1:09:00:: , he is forced to overcome habits---habit%1:09:00:: of politeness---politeness%1:07:00:: and neighborliness---neighborliness%1:07:00:: ; once in power---power%1:26:00:: he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism---opportunism%1:07:00:: that causes him to alternate between megalomania---megalomania%1:26:00:: and envy---envy%1:12:00:: of those above him .
`` Is this the type---type%1:09:00:: of citizen---citizen%1:18:00:: you desire '' ? the Trial should have asked the nations---nation%1:14:00:: .
But though this characterization---characterization%1:10:00:: in no way diminished Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: 's guilt---guilt%1:26:00:: , the Prosecutor---prosecutor%1:18:00:: , more deeply involved in the tactics---tactic%1:09:00:: of a criminal case---case%1:04:00:: than a political one , would have none of it .
Finally , if the mission---mission%1:04:00:: of the Trial was to convict anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: , how could it have failed to post before the world---world%1:14:02:: the contrasting fates---fate%1:11:00:: of the countries---country%1:14:00:: in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew---jew%1:18:00:: haters---hater%1:18:00:: - i.e. , Germany---germany%1:15:00:: , Poland---poland%1:15:00:: , Hungary---hungary%1:15:00:: , Czechoslovakia---czechoslovakia%1:15:00:: - and those in which it met the obstacle---obstacle%1:09:00:: of human solidarity---solidarity%1:07:00:: - Denmark---denmark%1:15:00:: , Holland---holland%1:15:00:: , Italy---italy%1:15:00:: , Bulgaria---bulgaria%1:15:00:: , France---france%1:15:00:: ?
Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact---fact%1:10:01:: of our time---time%1:28:00:: that the nations---nation%1:14:01:: poisoned by anti-Semitism---anti-semitism%1:09:00:: proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: than those whose citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: saved their Jewish compatriots---compatriot%1:18:00:: from the transports---transport%1:06:00:: ?
Was n't this meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: of Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: 's experience---experience%1:09:00:: in various countries---country%1:14:00:: worth highlighting ?
As the first collective confrontation---confrontation%1:10:01:: of the Nazi outrage---outrage%1:04:01:: , the Trial of Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: represents a recovery---recovery%1:22:00:: of the Jews---jew%1:18:00:: from the shock---shock%1:12:01:: of the death---death%1:19:00:: camps---camp%1:06:02:: , a recovery---recovery%1:22:00:: that took fifteen years---year%1:28:01:: and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence---silence%1:07:02:: ) .
Only across a distance---distance%1:07:00:: of time---time%1:28:05:: could the epic accounting---accounting%1:10:00:: begin .
It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews---jew%1:18:00:: of Europe---europe%1:17:00:: .
It is not that the facts---fact%1:09:01:: of the persecution---persecution%1:04:00:: were unavailable ; most of the information---information%1:10:00:: elicited in Jerusalem---jerusalem%1:15:00:: had been brought to the surface---surface%1:09:01:: by the numerous War Crimes---war_crime%1:04:00:: tribunals---tribunal%1:14:00:: and investigating---investigating%1:04:00:: commissions---commission%1:14:00:: , and by reports---report%1:10:03:: , memoirs---memoir%1:10:00:: , and survivors---survivor%1:18:03:: ' accounts---account%1:10:00:: .
The many linguistic techniques---technique%1:09:00:: for reducing the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: information---information%1:10:00:: that have been proposed all organize the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: 's contents---content%1:14:00:: around prefixes---prefix%1:10:00:: , stems---stem%1:10:01:: , suffixes---suffix%1:10:00:: , etc. .
A significant reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: in the voume---volume%1:07:03:: of store---store%1:21:00:: information---information%1:10:00:: is thus realized , especially for a highly inflected language---language%1:10:00:: such as Russian---russian%1:10:00:: .
For English---english%1:10:00:: the reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: in size---size%1:07:00:: is less striking .
This approach---approach%1:04:02:: requires that : ( 1 ) each text---text%1:10:00:: word---word%1:10:00:: be separated into smaller elements---element%1:06:00:: to establish a correspondence---correspondence%1:07:02:: between the occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: and dictionary entries---dictionary_entry%1:10:00:: , and ( 2 ) the information---information%1:10:00:: retrieved from several entries---entry%1:10:01:: in the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: be synthesized into a description---description%1:10:01:: of the particular word---word%1:10:00:: .
The logical scheme---scheme%1:09:00:: used to accomplish the former influences the placement---placement%1:07:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: in the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: file---file%1:10:00:: .
Implementation---implementation%1:04:00:: of the latter requires storage---storage%1:04:01:: of information---information%1:10:00:: needed only for synthesis---synthesis%1:09:00:: .
We suggest the application---application%1:04:02:: of certain data-processing---data_processing%1:22:00:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: as a solution---solution%1:09:00:: to the problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
But first , we must define two terms---term%1:10:00:: so that their meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: will be clearly understood :
form---form%1:10:00:: - any unique sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: of alphabetic characters---alphabetic_character%1:10:00:: that can appear in a language---language%1:10:00:: preceded and followed by a space---space%1:10:00:: .
occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: - an instance---instance%1:11:00:: of a form---form%1:10:00:: in text---text%1:10:00:: .
We propose a method---method%1:09:00:: for selecting only dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: information---information%1:10:00:: required by the text---text%1:10:00:: being translated and a means---means%1:04:00:: for passing the information---information%1:10:00:: directly to the occurrences---occurrence%1:11:00:: in text---text%1:10:00:: .
We accomplish this by compiling a list---list%1:10:00:: of text---text%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: as text---text%1:10:00:: is read by the computer---computer%1:06:00:: .
A random---ram%1:06:01:: storage---storage%1:04:01:: scheme---scheme%1:09:00:: , based on the spelling---spelling%1:10:00:: of forms---form%1:10:00:: , provides an economical way---way%1:04:01:: to compile this text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: .
Dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: found to match forms---form%1:10:00:: in the text---text%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: are marked .
A location---location%1:03:00:: in the computer---computer%1:06:00:: store---store%1:06:03:: is also named for each marked form---form%1:10:00:: ; dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: information---information%1:10:00:: about the form---form%1:10:00:: stored at this location---location%1:03:00:: can be retrieved directly by occurrences---occurrence%1:11:00:: of the form---form%1:10:00:: in text---text%1:10:00:: .
Finally , information---information%1:10:00:: is retrieved from the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: as required by stages---stage%1:28:00:: of the translation---translation%1:10:00:: process---process%1:04:00:: - the grammatic description---description%1:10:01:: for sentence-structure---sentence_structure%1:09:00:: determination---determination%1:04:00:: , equivalent---equivalent%1:09:00:: choice---choice%1:09:00:: information---information%1:10:00:: for semantic analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: , and target-language---target_language%1:10:01:: equivalents---equivalent%1:09:00:: for output---output%1:06:00:: construction---construction%1:04:00:: .
The dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: is a form---form%1:10:00:: dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: , at least in the sense---sense%1:10:00:: that complete forms---form%1:10:00:: are used as the basis---basis%1:24:00:: for matching text---text%1:10:00:: occurrences---occurrence%1:11:00:: with dictionary entries---dictionary_entry%1:10:00:: .
Also , the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: is divided into at least two parts---part%1:09:00:: :
the list---list%1:10:00:: of dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: and the file---file%1:10:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: that pertains to these forms---form%1:10:00:: .
A more detailed description---description%1:10:01:: of dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: operations---operation%1:22:00:: - text---text%1:10:00:: lookup---lookup%1:22:00:: and dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: modification---modification%1:04:00:: - give a clearer picture---picture%1:10:03:: .
Text---text%1:10:00:: lookup---lookup%1:22:00:: , as we will describe it , consists of three steps---step%1:04:02:: .
The first is compiling---compiling%1:04:00:: a list---list%1:10:00:: of text---text%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: , assigning---assigning%1:04:00:: an information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: to each , and replacing---replacing%1:04:00:: text---text%1:10:00:: occurrences---occurrence%1:11:00:: with the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: assigned to the form---form%1:10:00:: of each occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: .
For this step---step%1:04:02:: the computer---computer%1:06:00:: memory---memory%1:06:00:: is separated into three regions---region%1:15:00:: : cells---cell%1:06:03:: in the W region are used for storage---storage%1:04:01:: of the forms---form%1:10:00:: in the text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: ; cells---cell%1:06:03:: in the X-region and Y region are reserved as information---information%1:10:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: for text---text%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: .
When an occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: * * f is isolated during text---text%1:10:00:: reading---reading%1:09:00:: , a random memory---random_memory%1:06:00:: address---address%1:10:04:: * * f , the address---address%1:10:04:: of a cell---cell%1:06:03:: in the X-region , is computed from the form---form%1:10:00:: of * * f .
Let * * f denote the form---form%1:10:00:: of * * f .
If cell---cell%1:06:03:: * * f has not previously been assigned as the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: of a form---form%1:10:00:: in the text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: , it is now assigned as the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: of * * f .
The form---form%1:10:00:: itself is stored in the next available cells---cell%1:06:03:: of the W-region , beginning in cell---cell%1:06:03:: * * f .
The address---address%1:10:04:: * * f and the number---number%1:07:00:: of cells---cell%1:06:03:: required to store the form---form%1:10:00:: are written in * * f ; the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: * * f is saved to represent the text---text%1:10:00:: occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: .
Text---text%1:10:00:: reading---reading%1:09:00:: continues with the next occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: .
Let us assume that * * f is identical to the form---form%1:10:00:: of an occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: * * f which preceded * * f in the text---text%1:10:00:: .
When this situation---situation%1:26:00:: exists , the address---address%1:10:04:: * * f will equal * * f which was produced from * * f .
If * * f was assigned as the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: for * * f , the routine---routine%1:10:00:: can detect that * * f is identical to * * f by comparing * * f with the form---form%1:10:00:: stored at location---location%1:03:00:: * * f .
The address---address%1:10:04:: * * f is stored in the cell---cell%1:06:03:: * * f .
When , as in this case---case%1:11:00:: , the two forms---form%1:10:00:: match , the address---address%1:10:04:: * * f is saved to represent the occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: * * f .
Text---text%1:10:00:: reading---reading%1:09:00:: continues with the next occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: .
A third situation---situation%1:26:00:: is possible .
The formula---formula%1:10:02:: for computing random---random-access_memory%1:06:00:: addresses---address%1:10:04:: from the form---form%1:10:00:: of each occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: will not give a distinct address---address%1:10:04:: for each distinct form---form%1:10:00:: .
Thus , when more than one distinct form---form%1:10:00:: leads to a particular cell---cell%1:06:03:: in the X-region , a chain---chain%1:14:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: must be created to accommodate the forms---form%1:10:00:: , one cell---cell%1:06:03:: in the chain---chain%1:14:00:: for each form---form%1:10:00:: .
If * * f leads to an address---address%1:10:04:: * * f that is equal to the address---address%1:10:04:: computed from * * f , even though * * f does not match * * f , the chain---chain%1:14:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: is extended from * * f by storing the address---address%1:10:04:: of the next available cell---cell%1:06:03:: in the Y-region , * * f , in * * f .
The cell---cell%1:06:03:: * * f becomes the second information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: in the chain---chain%1:14:00:: and is assigned as the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: of * * f .
A third cell---cell%1:06:03:: can be added by storing the address---address%1:10:04:: of another Y-cell in * * f ; similarly , as many cells---cell%1:06:03:: are added as are required .
Each information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: in the chain---chain%1:14:00:: contains the address---address%1:10:04:: of the Y-cell where the form---form%1:10:00:: to which it is assigned is stored .
Each cell---cell%1:06:03:: except the last in the chain---chain%1:14:00:: also contains the address---address%1:10:04:: of the Y-cell that is the next element---element%1:06:00:: of the chain---chain%1:14:00:: ; the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of such a link---link%1:24:00:: in the last cell---cell%1:06:03:: indicates the end---end%1:15:00:: of the chain---chain%1:14:00:: .
Hence , when the address---address%1:10:04:: * * f is computed from * * f , the cell---cell%1:06:03:: * * f and all Y-cells in its chain---chain%1:14:00:: must be inspected to determine whether * * f is already in the form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: or whether it should be added to the form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: and the chain---chain%1:14:00:: .
When the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: for * * f has been determined , it is saved as a representation---representation%1:09:00:: of * * f .
Text---text%1:10:00:: reading---reading%1:09:00:: continues with the next occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: .
Text---text%1:10:00:: reading---reading%1:09:00:: is terminated when a pre-determined number---number%1:07:00:: of forms---form%1:10:00:: have been stored in the text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: .
This initiates the second step---step%1:04:02:: of glossary---glossary%1:10:00:: lookup---lookup%1:22:00:: - connecting the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: of forms---form%1:10:00:: in the text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: to dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: .
Each form---form%1:10:00:: represented by the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: is looked up in the text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: .
Each time---time%1:11:00:: a dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: matches a text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: , the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: of the matching text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: is saved .
The number---number%1:07:00:: of dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: skipped since the last one matched is also saved .
These two pieces---piece%1:06:05:: of information---information%1:10:00:: for each dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: that is matched by a text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: constitute the table---table%1:14:00:: of dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: usage---usage%1:04:00:: .
If each text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: is marked when matched with a dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: , the text---text%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: not contained in the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: can be identified when all dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: have been read .
The appropriate action---action%1:04:02:: for handling these forms---form%1:10:00:: can be taken at that time---time%1:28:06:: .
Each dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: is looked up in the text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: by the same method---method%1:09:00:: used to look up a new text---text%1:10:00:: occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: in the form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: during text---text%1:10:00:: reading---reading%1:09:00:: .
A random address---address%1:10:04:: * * f that lies within the X-region of memory---memory%1:06:00:: mentioned earlier is computed from the i-th dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: .
If cell---cell%1:06:03:: * * f is an information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: , it and any information---information%1:10:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: in the Y-region that have been linked to * * f each contain an address---address%1:10:04:: in the W-region where a potentially matching form---form%1:10:00:: is stored .
The dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: is compared with each of these text---text%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: .
When a match---match%1:06:01:: is found , an entry---entry%1:10:01:: is made in the table---table%1:14:00:: of dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: usage---usage%1:04:00:: .
If cell---cell%1:06:03:: * * f is not an information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: we conclude that the i-th dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: is not in the text---text%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: .
These two steps---step%1:04:02:: essentially complete the lookup---lookup%1:22:00:: operation---operation%1:22:00:: .
The final step---step%1:04:02:: merely uses the table---table%1:14:00:: of dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: usage---usage%1:04:00:: to select the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: information---information%1:10:00:: that pertains to each form---form%1:10:00:: matched in the text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: , and uses the list---list%1:10:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: recorded in text---text%1:10:00:: order---order%1:14:00:: to attach the appropriate information---information%1:10:00:: to each occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: in text---text%1:10:00:: .
The list---list%1:10:00:: of text---text%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: in the W-region of memory---memory%1:06:00:: and the contents---content%1:14:00:: of the information---information%1:10:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: in the X and Y-regions are no longer required .
Only the assignment---assignment%1:04:02:: of the information---information%1:10:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: is important .
The first stage---stage%1:28:00:: of translation---translation%1:10:00:: after glossary---glossary%1:10:00:: lookup---lookup%1:22:00:: is structural analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of the input---input%1:10:00:: text---text%1:10:00:: .
The grammatical description---description%1:10:01:: of each occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: in the text---text%1:10:00:: must be retrieved from the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: to permit such an analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: .
A description---description%1:10:01:: of this process---process%1:04:00:: will serve to illustrate how any type---type%1:09:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: can be retrieved from the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: and attached to each text---text%1:10:00:: occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: .
The grammatic descriptions---description%1:10:01:: of all forms---form%1:10:00:: in the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: are recorded in a separate part---part%1:09:00:: of the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: file---file%1:10:00:: .
The order---order%1:14:00:: is identical to the ordering---ordering%1:14:00:: of the forms---form%1:10:00:: they describe .
When entries---entry%1:10:01:: are being retrieved from this file---file%1:10:00:: , the table---table%1:14:00:: of dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: usage---usage%1:04:00:: indicates which entries---entry%1:10:01:: to skip and which entries---entry%1:10:01:: to store in the computer---computer%1:06:00:: .
This selection---selection%1:04:00:: rejection---rejection%1:04:00:: process---process%1:04:00:: takes place as the file---file%1:10:00:: is read .
Each entry---entry%1:10:01:: that is selected for storage---storage%1:04:01:: is written into the next available cells---cell%1:06:03:: of the W-region .
The address---address%1:10:04:: of the first cell---cell%1:06:03:: and the number---number%1:07:00:: of cells---cell%1:06:03:: used is written in the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: for the form---form%1:10:00:: .
( The address---address%1:10:04:: of the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: is also supplied by the table---table%1:14:00:: of dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: usage---usage%1:04:00:: . )
When the complete file---file%1:10:00:: has been read , the grammatic descriptions---description%1:10:01:: for all text---text%1:10:00:: forms---form%1:10:00:: found in the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: have been stored in the W-region ; the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: assigned to each text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: contains the address---address%1:10:04:: of the grammatic description---description%1:10:01:: of the form---form%1:10:00:: it represents .
Hence , the description---description%1:10:01:: of each text---text%1:10:00:: occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: can be retrieved by reading the list---list%1:10:00:: of text---text%1:10:00:: ordered information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: addresses---address%1:10:04:: and outputting the description---description%1:10:01:: indicated by the information---information%1:10:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: for each occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: .
The only requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: on dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: information---information%1:10:00:: made by the text---text%1:10:00:: lookup---lookup%1:22:00:: operation---operation%1:22:00:: are that each form---form%1:10:00:: represented by the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: be available for lookup---lookup%1:22:00:: in the text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: and that information---information%1:10:00:: for each form---form%1:10:00:: be available in a sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: identical with the sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: of the forms---form%1:10:00:: .
This leaves the ordering---ordering%1:14:00:: of entries---entry%1:10:01:: variable .
( Here an entry---entry%1:10:01:: is a form---form%1:10:00:: plus the information---information%1:10:00:: that pertains to it . )
Two very useful ways---way%1:04:01:: for modifying a form---form%1:10:00:: dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: are the addition---addition%1:04:02:: to the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: of complete paradigms---paradigm%1:24:00:: rather than single forms---form%1:10:00:: and the application---application%1:04:02:: of a single change---change%1:11:00:: to more than one dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: .
The former is intended to decrease the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of work---work%1:04:00:: necessary to extend dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: coverage---coverage%1:07:00:: .
The latter is useful for modifying information---information%1:10:00:: about some or all forms---form%1:10:00:: of a word---word%1:10:00:: , hence reducing the work---work%1:04:00:: required to improve dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: contents---content%1:14:00:: .
Applying the techniques---technique%1:09:00:: developed at Harvard---harvard%1:06:00:: for generating a paradigm---paradigm%1:24:00:: from a representative form---form%1:10:00:: and its classification---classification%1:14:00:: , we can add all forms---form%1:10:00:: of a word---word%1:10:00:: to the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: at once .
An extension---extension%1:04:02:: of the principle---principle%1:09:03:: would permit entering a grammatic description---description%1:10:01:: of each form---form%1:10:00:: .
Equivalents---equivalent%1:09:00:: could be assigned to the paradigm---paradigm%1:24:00:: either at the time---time%1:28:06:: it is added to the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: or after the word---word%1:10:00:: has been studied in context---context%1:10:00:: .
Thus , one can think of a dictionary entry---dictionary_entry%1:10:00:: as a word---word%1:10:00:: rather than a form---form%1:10:00:: .
If all forms---form%1:10:00:: of a paradigm---paradigm%1:24:00:: are grouped together within the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: , a considerable reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: in the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: required is possible .
For example , the inflected forms---form%1:10:00:: of a word---word%1:10:00:: can be represented , insofar as regular inflection---inflection%1:24:00:: allows , by a stem---stem%1:10:01:: and a set---set%1:14:00:: of endings---ending%1:10:00:: to be attached .
( Indeed , the set---set%1:14:00:: of endings---ending%1:10:00:: can be replaced by the name---name%1:10:00:: of a set---set%1:14:00:: of endings---ending%1:10:00:: . )
The full forms---form%1:10:00:: can be derived from such information---information%1:10:00:: just prior to the lookup---lookup%1:22:00:: of the form---form%1:10:00:: in the text---text%1:10:00:: form---form%1:10:00:: list---list%1:10:00:: .
Similarly , if the equivalents---equivalent%1:09:00:: for the forms---form%1:10:00:: of a word---word%1:10:00:: do not vary , the equivalents---equivalent%1:09:00:: need be entered only once with an indication---indication%1:10:00:: that they apply to each form---form%1:10:00:: .
The dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: system---system%1:14:00:: is in no way dependent upon such summarization or designed around it .
When irregularity---irregularity%1:07:00:: and variation---variation%1:04:00:: prevent summarizing , information---information%1:10:00:: is written in complete detail---detail%1:10:00:: .
Entries---entry%1:10:01:: are summarized only when by doing so the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: retained in the dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: is reduced and the time---time%1:28:05:: required for dictionary---dictionary%1:10:00:: operations---operation%1:22:00:: is decreased .
Knowing specifically what the many feed---feed%1:13:00:: additives---additive%1:06:00:: can do and how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business---business%1:14:00:: more profitable for beef---beef_man%1:18:00:: , dairy---dairyman%1:18:00:: , and sheep men---sheepman%1:18:00:: .
The target---target%1:09:00:: chart---chart%1:10:00:: quickly and briefly tells you which additives---additive%1:06:00:: do what .

Then , feed preventive dose---dose%1:06:00:: until 6 weeks---week%1:28:00:: after calving---calving%1:22:00:: .
A tranquilizer---tranquilizer%1:06:00:: fed to cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: ( other than lactating dairy cows---dairy_cow%1:05:00:: ) prior to their being subjected to stress---stress%1:26:01:: conditions---condition%1:26:00:: such as vaccinating---vaccinating%1:04:00:: , shipping---shipping%1:04:00:: , weaning---weaning%1:04:00:: calves---calf%1:05:00:: , and excessive handling---handling%1:04:01:: .

Additive---additive%1:06:00:: should not be fed 72 hours---hour%1:28:00:: before animals---animal%1:03:00:: are slaughtered .
There are three principal feed bunk---feed_bunk%1:06:00:: types---type%1:09:00:: for dairy---dairy_cattle%1:05:00:: and beef cattle---beef_cattle%1:05:00:: : ( 1 ) Fence-line---fence_line%1:15:00:: bunks---bunk%1:06:03:: - cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: eat from one side---side%1:15:02:: while feed---feed%1:13:00:: is put in from the opposite side---side%1:15:02:: of the fence---fence%1:06:00:: by self unloading---unloading%1:04:00:: wagons---wagon%1:06:00:: ; ( 2 ) Mechanized bunks---bunk%1:06:03:: - they sit within the feed lot---feedlot%1:06:00:: , are filled by a mechanical conveyor---conveyor%1:06:00:: above feeding---feeding%1:04:01:: surface---surface%1:06:00:: ; ( 3 ) Special bunks---bunk%1:06:03:: - as discussed here , they permit cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: to eat from all sides---side%1:15:02:: .
Feed---feed%1:13:00:: is put in with an elevator---elevator%1:06:00:: .
Several materials---material%1:27:00:: or combinations---combination%1:14:00:: of materials---material%1:27:00:: can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk---feed_bunk%1:06:00:: .
The selection---selection%1:04:00:: of materials---material%1:27:00:: depends on skills---skill%1:09:01:: of available labor---labor%1:14:00:: for installation---installation%1:04:00:: , cost---cost%1:21:00:: of materials---material%1:27:00:: available locally , and your own preference---preference%1:09:01:: .
No one material---material%1:27:00:: is best for all situations---situation%1:26:00:: .
Selecting bunks---bunk%1:06:03:: by economic comparison---comparison%1:24:00:: is usually an individual problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
Animals---animal%1:03:00:: eat only from one side---side%1:15:02:: , so the fence-line---fence_line%1:15:00:: bunk---bunk%1:06:03:: must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk---bunk%1:06:03:: .
These bunks---bunk%1:06:03:: also serve as a fence---fence%1:06:00:: , so part---part%1:24:00:: of the additional cost---cost%1:21:00:: must be attributed to the fence---fence%1:06:00:: .
Because of their location---location%1:03:00:: , on the edge---edge%1:15:00:: of the feed lot---feedlot%1:06:00:: , fence-line---fence_line%1:15:00:: bunks---bunk%1:06:03:: are not in the way of mechanical manure---manure%1:27:00:: removal---removal%1:04:00:: .
Filling these bunks---bunk%1:06:03:: by the same self unloading---unloading%1:04:00:: wagons---wagon%1:06:00:: used to fill silos---silo%1:06:00:: spreads cost---cost%1:21:00:: of the wagons---wagon%1:06:00:: over more time---time%1:03:00:: and operations---operation%1:04:05:: .
All-weather roads---road%1:06:00:: must be provided next to the feeding---feeding%1:04:01:: floor---floor%1:06:00:: so access---access%1:07:00:: will be possible all year---year%1:28:01:: .
This will be a problem---problem%1:26:00:: in areas---area%1:15:01:: of heavy snowfall---snowfall%1:19:00:: .
With this enlarged role---role%1:04:00:: in mind---mind%1:09:01:: , I should like to make a few suggestions---suggestion%1:10:00:: : What we in the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: do or do not do will make a very large difference---difference%1:11:00:: in what happens in the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the world---world%1:14:01:: .
We in this Department---department%1:14:00:: must think about foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: in its total context---context%1:26:00:: .
We cannot regard foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: as something left over after defense policy---defense_policy%1:09:00:: or trade policy---trade_policy%1:10:00:: or fiscal policy---fiscal_policy%1:10:00:: has been extracted .
Foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: is the total involvement---involvement%1:04:00:: of the American people---people%1:14:01:: with peoples---people%1:14:01:: and governments---government%1:14:00:: abroad .
That means that , if we are to achieve a new standard---standard%1:09:00:: of leadership---leadership%1:04:00:: , we must think in terms of the total context---context%1:26:00:: of our situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
It is the concern---concern%1:09:00:: of the Department of State---department_of_state%1:14:00:: that the American people---people%1:14:01:: are safe and secure - defense---defense%1:04:00:: is not a monopoly---monopoly%1:26:02:: concern---concern%1:09:00:: of the Department of Defense---department_of_defense%1:14:00:: .
It is also the concern---concern%1:09:00:: of the Department of State---department_of_state%1:14:00:: that our trading---trading%1:04:00:: relationships---relationship%1:26:01:: with the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the world---world%1:14:01:: are vigorous , profitable , and active - this is not just a passing interest---interest%1:09:00:: or a matter---matter%1:09:00:: of concern---concern%1:12:01:: only to the Department of Commerce---department_of_commerce%1:14:00:: .
We can no longer rely on interdepartmental machinery---machinery%1:14:00:: `` somewhere upstairs '' to resolve differences---difference%1:07:00:: between this and other departments---department%1:14:00:: .
Assistant Secretaries of State---person%1:03:00:: will now carry an increased burden---burden%1:09:01:: of active formulation---formulation%1:04:00:: and coordination---coordination%1:04:00:: of policies---policy%1:09:00:: .
Means---means%1:06:00:: must be found to enable us to keep in touch---touch%1:10:02:: as regularly and as efficiently as possible with our colleagues---colleague%1:18:00:: in other departments---department%1:14:00:: concerned with foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: .
I think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness---timeliness%1:07:01:: of action---action%1:04:02:: .
Every policy---policy%1:10:00:: officer---officer%1:18:02:: cannot help but be a planning---planning%1:04:02:: officer---officer%1:18:02:: .
Unless we keep our eyes---eye%1:08:00:: on the horizon---horizon%1:07:00:: ahead , we shall fail to bring ourselves on target---target%1:10:00:: with the present---present%1:28:00:: .
The movement---movement%1:11:00:: of events---event%1:03:00:: is so fast , the pace---pace%1:07:01:: so severe , that an attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to peer into the future---future%1:28:00:: is essential if we are to think accurately about the present---present%1:28:00:: .
If there is anything which we can do in the executive branch---executive_branch%1:14:00:: of the Government---government%1:14:00:: to speed up the processes---process%1:04:00:: by which we come to decisions---decision%1:09:00:: on matters---matter%1:09:01:: on which we must act promptly , that in itself would be a major contribution---contribution%1:04:02:: to the conduct---conduct%1:04:00:: of our affairs---affairs%1:09:00:: .
Action---action%1:04:02:: taken today is often far more valuable than action---action%1:04:02:: taken several months---month%1:28:01:: later in response---response%1:19:00:: to a situation---situation%1:26:00:: then out of control---control%1:07:00:: .
There will of course be times---time%1:11:00:: for delay---delay%1:28:00:: and inaction---inaction%1:26:00:: .
What I am suggesting is that when we delay , or when we fail to act , we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence---inadvertence%1:09:00:: or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulties---difficulty%1:26:00:: .
I also hope that we can do something about reducing the infant mortality rate of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: - an affliction of all bureaucracies---bureaucracy%1:14:00:: .
We want to stimulate ideas---idea%1:09:00:: from the bottom---bottom%1:15:01:: to the top---top%1:15:01:: of the Department---department%1:14:00:: .
We want to make sure that our junior colleagues---colleague%1:18:00:: realize that ideas---idea%1:09:00:: are welcome , that initiative---initiative%1:07:00:: goes right down to the bottom---bottom%1:15:01:: and goes all the way to the top---top%1:15:01:: .
I hope no one expects that only Presidential appointees---appointee%1:18:01:: are looked upon as sources---source%1:09:00:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: .
The responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: for taking the initiative---initiative%1:04:00:: in generating ideas---idea%1:09:00:: is that of every officer---officer%1:18:02:: in the Department---department%1:14:00:: who has a policy---policy%1:10:00:: function---function%1:04:00:: , regardless of rank---rank%1:26:00:: .
Further , I would hope that we could pay attention to little things---thing%1:09:02:: .
While observing the operations of our Government---government%1:14:00:: in various parts---part%1:15:00:: of the world---world%1:17:00:: , I have felt that in many situations---situation%1:26:00:: where our policies---policy%1:10:00:: were good we have tended to ignore minor problems---problem%1:09:00:: which spoiled our main effort---effort%1:04:00:: .
To cite only a few examples---example%1:09:00:: :
The wrong man---man%1:18:04:: in the wrong position---position%1:04:01:: , perhaps even in a junior position---position%1:04:01:: abroad , can be a source---source%1:09:00:: of great harm---harm%1:11:01:: to our policy---policy%1:10:00:: ; the attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: of a U.N.---un%1:14:00:: delegate---delegate%1:18:00:: who experiences difficulty---difficulty%1:09:02:: in finding adequate housing---housing%1:06:00:: in New York City---new_york_city%1:15:00:: , or of a foreign diplomat---diplomat%1:18:00:: in similar circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: in our Capital---capital%1:15:00:: , can be easily be directed against the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: and all that it stands for .
Dozens---dozens%1:23:00:: of seemingly small matters---matter%1:09:01:: go wrong all over the world---world%1:17:00:: .
Sometimes those who know about them are too far down the line---line%1:14:01:: to be able to do anything about them .
I would hope that we could create the recognition---recognition%1:26:00:: in the Department---department%1:14:00:: and overseas that those who come across little things---thing%1:26:00:: going wrong have the responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: for bringing these to the attention---attention%1:04:01:: of those who can do something about them .
If the Department of State---department_of_state%1:14:00:: is to take primary responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: for foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: in Washington---washington%1:14:00:: , it follows that the ambassador---ambassador%1:18:00:: is expected to take charge overseas .
This does not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active , operational , interested , responsible fashion---fashion%1:07:00:: .
He is expected to know about what is going on among the representatives---representative%1:18:00:: of other agencies---agency%1:14:00:: who are stationed in his country---country%1:15:00:: .
He is expected to supervise , to encourage , to direct , to assist in any way---way%1:07:01:: he can .
If any official operation---operation%1:04:03:: abroad begins to go wrong , we shall look to the ambassador---ambassador%1:18:00:: to find out why and to get suggestions---suggestion%1:09:00:: for remedial action---action%1:04:02:: .
It occurred to me that you might be interested in some thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: which I expressed privately in recent years---year%1:28:01:: , in the hope---hope%1:12:01:: of clearing up a certain confusion---confusion%1:09:00:: in the public mind---mind%1:09:00:: about what foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: is all about and what it means , and of developing a certain compassion---compassion%1:12:00:: for those who are carrying such responsibilities---responsibility%1:04:00:: inside Government---government%1:14:00:: .
I tried to do so by calling to their attention---attention%1:09:01:: some of the problems---problem%1:09:00:: that a senior departmental policy---policy%1:10:00:: officer---officer%1:18:02:: faces .
This means practically everybody in this room---room%1:06:00:: .
The senior policy---policy%1:10:00:: officer---officer%1:18:02:: may be moved to think hard about a problem---problem%1:26:00:: by any of an infinite variety---variety%1:14:01:: of stimuli---stimulus%1:09:00:: : an idea---idea%1:09:00:: in his own head---head%1:08:00:: , the suggestions---suggestion%1:09:00:: of a colleague---colleague%1:18:00:: , a question---question%1:10:00:: from the Secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: or the President---president%1:18:04:: , a proposal---proposal%1:10:00:: by another department---department%1:14:00:: , a communication---communication%1:03:00:: from a foreign government---government%1:14:00:: or an American ambassador---ambassador%1:18:00:: abroad , the filing---filing%1:10:00:: of an item---item%1:10:00:: for the agenda---agenda%1:09:00:: of the United Nations---united_nations%1:14:00:: or of any other of dozens---dozens%1:23:00:: of international bodies---body%1:14:00:: , a news item---news_item%1:10:00:: read at the breakfast table---breakfast_table%1:06:00:: , a question---question%1:10:00:: to the President---president%1:18:04:: or the Secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: at a news conference---news_conference%1:10:00:: , a speech---speech%1:10:01:: by a Senator---senator%1:18:00:: or Congressman---congressman%1:18:00:: , an article---article%1:10:00:: in a periodical---periodical%1:10:00:: , a resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: from a national organization---organization%1:14:01:: , a request---request%1:10:01:: for assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: from some private American interests---interest%1:14:00:: abroad , et cetera , ad infinitum .
The policy---policy%1:10:00:: officer---officer%1:18:02:: lives with his antennae---antenna%1:07:00:: alerted for the questions---question%1:10:00:: which fall within his range---range%1:07:00:: of responsibility---responsibility%1:26:00:: .
His first thought---thought%1:09:01:: is about the question---question%1:10:00:: itself :
Is there a question---question%1:10:00:: here for American foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: , and , if so , what is it ?
For he knows that the first and sometimes most difficult job---job%1:04:01:: is to know what the question---question%1:10:00:: is - that when it is accurately identified it sometimes answers itself , and that the way---way%1:07:01:: in which it is posed frequently shapes the answer---answer%1:10:01:: .
Chewing it over with his colleagues---colleague%1:18:00:: and in his own mind---mind%1:09:00:: , he reaches a tentative identification---identification%1:04:00:: of the question---question%1:10:00:: - tentative because it may change as he explores it further and because , if no tolerable answer---answer%1:10:02:: can be found , it may have to be changed into one which can be answered .
Meanwhile he has been thinking about the facts---fact%1:09:01:: surrounding the problem---problem%1:26:00:: , facts---fact%1:09:01:: which he knows can never be complete , and the general background---background%1:09:01:: , much---much%1:23:00:: of which has already been lost to history---history%1:28:02:: .
He is appreciative of the expert help---help%1:07:00:: available to him and draws these resources---resource%1:07:00:: into play---play%1:04:08:: , taking care to examine at least some of the raw material---raw_material%1:27:00:: which underlies their frequently policy---policy%1:10:00:: oriented conclusions---conclusion%1:09:00:: .
He knows that he must give the expert---expert%1:18:00:: his place---place%1:26:00:: , but he knows that he must also keep him in it .
He is already beginning to box the compass---compass%1:07:00:: of alternative lines---line%1:14:02:: of action---action%1:04:02:: , including doing nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
He knows that he is thinking about action---action%1:04:02:: in relation to a future---future%1:28:00:: which can be perceived but dimly through a merciful fog---fog%1:09:00:: .
But he takes his bearings---bearing%1:15:00:: from the great guidelines of policy---policy%1:10:00:: , well established precedents---precedent%1:10:00:: , the commitments---commitment%1:04:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: under international charters---charter%1:10:00:: and treaties---treaty%1:10:00:: , basic statutes---statute%1:10:00:: , and well understood notions---notion%1:09:00:: of the American people---people%1:14:01:: about how we are to conduct ourselves , in policy---policy%1:10:00:: literature---literature%1:10:01:: such as country---country%1:14:00:: papers---papers%1:10:00:: and National Security Council---group%1:03:00:: papers---papers%1:10:00:: accumulated in the Department---department%1:14:00:: .
He will not be surprised to find that general principles---principle%1:09:00:: produce conflicting results---result%1:19:00:: in the factual situation---situation%1:26:00:: with which he is confronted .
He must think about which of these principles---principle%1:09:00:: must take precedence---precedence%1:26:00:: .
He will know that general policy---policy%1:10:00:: papers---papers%1:10:00:: written months---month%1:28:01:: before may not fit his problem---problem%1:26:00:: because of crucial changes---change%1:11:00:: in circumstance---circumstance%1:26:02:: .
He is aware that every moderately important problem---problem%1:26:00:: merges imperceptibly into every other problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
He must deal with the question---question%1:10:01:: of how to manage a part---part%1:06:00:: when it cannot be handled without relation to the whole - when the whole is too large to grasp .
He must think of others who have a stake---stake%1:21:02:: in the question---question%1:10:01:: and in its answer---answer%1:10:02:: .
Who should be consulted among his colleagues---colleague%1:18:00:: in the Department---department%1:14:00:: or other departments---department%1:14:00:: and agencies---agency%1:14:00:: of the Government---government%1:14:00:: ?
Which American ambassadors---ambassador%1:18:00:: could provide helpful advice---advice%1:10:00:: ?
Are private interests---interest%1:14:00:: sufficiently involved to be consulted ?
What is the probable attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of other governments---government%1:14:00:: , including those less directly involved ?
How and at what stage---stage%1:28:00:: and in what sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: are other governments---government%1:14:00:: to be consulted ?
If action---action%1:04:02:: is indicated , what kind---kind%1:09:00:: of action---action%1:04:02:: is relevant to the problem---problem%1:26:00:: ?
The selection---selection%1:04:00:: of the wrong tools---tool%1:04:00:: can mean waste---waste%1:07:00:: , at best , and at worst an unwanted inflammation of the problem---problem%1:26:00:: itself .
Can the President---president%1:18:04:: or the Secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: act under existing authority---authority%1:07:00:: , or will new legislation---legislation%1:10:00:: and new money---money%1:21:02:: be required ?
Should the action---action%1:04:02:: be unilateral or multilateral ?
Is the matter---matter%1:09:00:: one for the United Nations---united_nations%1:14:00:: or some other international body---body%1:14:00:: ?
For , if so , the path---path%1:04:00:: leads through a complex process---process%1:04:00:: of parliamentary diplomacy---diplomacy%1:10:00:: which adds still another dimension---dimension%1:09:00:: to the problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
What type---type%1:09:00:: of action---action%1:04:02:: can hope to win public support---support%1:09:00:: , first in this country---country%1:14:00:: and then abroad ?
For the policy---policy%1:10:00:: officer---officer%1:18:02:: will know that action---action%1:04:02:: can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness---effectiveness%1:07:00:: of policy---policy%1:10:00:: will be conditioned by the readiness---readiness%1:07:01:: of the country---country%1:14:01:: to sustain it .
He is interested in public opinion---opinion%1:09:01:: for two reasons---reason%1:16:00:: :
first , because it is important in itself , and , second , because he knows that the American public---public%1:14:00:: cares about a decent respect---respect%1:09:01:: for the opinions---opinion%1:09:00:: of mankind .
And , given probable public attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: - about which reasonably good estimates---estimate%1:04:01:: can be made - what action---action%1:04:02:: is called for to insure necessary support---support%1:04:00:: ?
May I add a caution---caution%1:10:00:: on this particular point---point%1:09:01:: ?
We do not want policy---policy%1:10:00:: officers---officer%1:18:02:: below the level---level%1:26:01:: of Presidential appointees---appointee%1:18:01:: to concern themselves too much with problems---problem%1:26:00:: of domestic politics---politics%1:24:00:: in recommending foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: action---action%1:04:02:: .
In the first place our business---business%1:14:00:: is foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: , and it is the business---business%1:09:01:: of the Presidential leadership---leadership%1:14:00:: and his appointees---appointee%1:18:00:: in the Department---department%1:14:00:: to consider the domestic political aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: of a problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
Mr. Truman---person%1:03:00:: emphasized this point---point%1:09:01:: by saying , `` You fellows---fellow%1:18:00:: in the Department of State---department_of_state%1:14:00:: do n't know much---much%1:23:00:: about domestic politics---politics%1:24:00:: '' .
This is an important consideration---consideration%1:09:01:: .
If we sit here reading editorials---editorial%1:10:00:: and looking at public opinion polls---public_opinion_poll%1:09:00:: and other reports---report%1:10:03:: that cross our desks---desk%1:06:00:: , we should realize that this is raw , undigested opinion---opinion%1:09:01:: expressed in the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of leadership---leadership%1:04:00:: .
What the American people---people%1:14:01:: will do turns in large degree---degree%1:07:00:: on their leadership---leadership%1:14:00:: .
We cannot test public opinion---public_opinion%1:09:00:: until the President---president%1:18:04:: and the leaders---leaders%1:14:00:: of the country---country%1:14:00:: have gone to the public---public%1:14:01:: to explain what is required and have asked them for support---support%1:04:04:: for the necessary action---action%1:04:02:: .
I doubt , for example , that , 3 months---month%1:28:01:: before the leadership---leadership%1:14:00:: began to talk about what came to be the Marshall plan , any public-opinion---public_opinion%1:09:00:: expert---expert%1:18:00:: would have said that the country---country%1:14:01:: would have accepted such proposals---proposal%1:10:00:: .
The problem---problem%1:26:00:: in the policy---policy%1:10:00:: officer---officer%1:18:02:: 's mind---mind%1:09:00:: thus begins to take shape as a galaxy---galaxy%1:14:01:: of utterly complicated factors---factor%1:09:00:: - political , military , economic , financial , legal , legislative , procedural , administrative - to be sorted out and handled within a political system---political_system%1:14:00:: which moves---move%1:04:00:: by consent---consent%1:10:00:: in relation to an external environment---environment%1:26:00:: which cannot be under control .
And the policy---policy%1:10:00:: officer---officer%1:18:02:: has the hounds of time---time%1:03:00:: snapping at his heels .
At the entrance---entrance%1:06:00:: side---side%1:15:02:: of the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: , each roof---roof%1:06:00:: beam---beam%1:06:00:: is rested on the inside 4 inches---inch%1:23:00:: of the block---block%1:06:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
The outside 4 - inch---inch%1:23:00:: space---space%1:15:00:: is filled by mortaring blocks---block%1:06:00:: on edge---edge%1:15:00:: .
The wooden bracing---bracing%1:06:00:: between the roof---roof%1:06:00:: beams---beam%1:06:00:: is placed flush with the inside---inside%1:15:00:: of the wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
Mortar---mortar%1:27:00:: is poured between this bracing---bracing%1:06:00:: and the 4 - inch---inch%1:23:00:: blocks---block%1:06:00:: on edge---edge%1:15:00:: to complete the wall---wall%1:06:00:: thickness---thickness%1:07:01:: for radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: shielding---shielding%1:04:00:: .
( For details---detail%1:09:00:: see inset---inset%1:06:02:: , fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 5---5%1:23:00:: . )
The first one or two roof---roof%1:06:00:: boards---board%1:27:00:: ( marked `` E '' in fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 6---6%1:23:00:: ) are slipped into place---place%1:15:05:: across the roof---roof%1:06:00:: beams---beam%1:06:00:: , from outside the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: .
These boards---board%1:27:00:: are nailed to the roof---roof%1:06:00:: beams---beam%1:06:00:: by reaching up through the open space---space%1:25:00:: between the beams---beam%1:06:00:: , from inside the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: .
Concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: blocks---block%1:06:00:: are passed between the beams---beam%1:06:00:: and put on the boards---board%1:27:00:: .
The roof---roof%1:06:00:: blocks---block%1:06:00:: are in two layers---layer%1:06:00:: and are not mortared together .
Work---work%1:04:00:: on the roof---roof%1:06:00:: continues in this way---way%1:07:01:: .
The last roof---roof%1:06:00:: boards---board%1:27:00:: are covered with blocks---block%1:06:00:: from outside the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: .
When the roof---roof%1:06:00:: blocks---block%1:06:00:: are all in place , the final rows---row%1:06:00:: of wall---wall%1:06:00:: blocks---block%1:06:00:: are mortared into position---position%1:15:00:: .
The structure---structure%1:06:00:: is complete .
( See fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 7---7%1:23:00:: . )
Building---building%1:04:00:: plans---plan%1:06:00:: are on page---page%1:10:00:: 21---21%1:23:00:: .
Solid concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: blocks---block%1:06:00:: , relatively heavy and dense , are used for this shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: .
These blocks---block%1:06:00:: are sold in various sizes---size%1:07:01:: so it seldom is necessary to cut a block---block%1:06:00:: to fit .
Solid blocks---block%1:06:00:: are recommended because hollow blocks---block%1:06:00:: would have to be filled with concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: to give effective protection---protection%1:04:00:: .
Bricks---brick%1:06:00:: are an alternative---alternative%1:09:00:: .
If they are used , the walls---wall%1:06:00:: and roof---roof%1:06:00:: should be 10 inches---inch%1:23:00:: thick to give the same protection---protection%1:04:00:: as the 8 - inch---inch%1:23:00:: solid concrete blocks---block%1:06:00:: .
The illustrations---illustration%1:10:00:: in fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 8---8%1:23:00:: show how to lay a concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: block---block%1:06:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
More detailed instructions---instructions%1:10:00:: may be obtained from your local building supply houses---building_supply_house%1:06:00:: and craftsmen---craftsman%1:18:01:: .
Other sources---source%1:10:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: include the National Concrete Masonry Association---group%1:03:00:: , 38 South Dearborn Street---location%1:03:00:: , Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: , Ill.---illinois%1:15:00:: , the Portland Cement Association---group%1:03:00:: , 33 West Grand Avenue---location%1:03:00:: , Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: , Ill.---illinois%1:15:00:: , and the Structural Clay Products Association---group%1:03:00:: , Washington---washington%1:15:01:: , D. C.---dc%1:15:00:: .
An outdoor , aboveground fallout shelter---fallout_shelter%1:06:00:: also may be built with concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: blocks---block%1:06:00:: .
( See fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 9---9%1:23:00:: , double wall---wall%1:06:00:: shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: . )
Most people---people%1:14:00:: would have to hire a contractor---contractor%1:18:00:: to build this shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: .
Plans---plan%1:06:00:: are on pages---page%1:10:00:: 22---22%1:23:00:: and 23---23%1:23:00:: .
This shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: could be built in regions---region%1:15:00:: where water---water%1:27:00:: or rock---rock%1:27:00:: is close to the surface---surface%1:17:00:: , making it impractical to build an underground shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: .
Two walls---wall%1:06:00:: of concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: blocks---block%1:06:00:: are constructed at least 20 inches---inch%1:23:00:: apart .
The space---space%1:25:00:: between them is filled with pit-run---pit_run%1:27:00:: gravel---gravel%1:27:00:: or earth---earth%1:27:00:: .
The walls---wall%1:06:00:: are held together with metal---metal%1:27:00:: ties---tie%1:06:02:: placed in the wet mortar---mortar%1:27:00:: as the walls---wall%1:06:00:: are built .
The roof---roof%1:06:00:: shown here ( fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 9---9%1:23:00:: ) is a 6 - inch---inch%1:23:00:: slab---slab%1:06:00:: of reinforced concrete---reinforced_concrete%1:27:00:: , covered with at least 20 inches---inch%1:23:00:: of pit-run---pit_run%1:27:00:: gravel---gravel%1:27:00:: .
An alternate roof---roof%1:06:00:: , perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach---reach%1:09:00:: , could be constructed of heavy wooden roof---roof%1:06:00:: beams---beam%1:06:00:: , overlaid with boards---board%1:27:00:: and waterproofing---waterproofing%1:04:00:: .
It would have to be covered with at least 28 inches---inch%1:23:00:: of pit-run---pit_run%1:27:00:: gravel---gravel%1:27:00:: .
The materials---material%1:27:00:: for a double wall---wall%1:06:00:: shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: would cost about $ 700 .
Contractors---contractor%1:18:00:: ' charges---charge%1:21:02:: would be additional .
The shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: would provide almost absolute fallout---fallout%1:27:00:: protection---protection%1:04:00:: .
Pre shaped corrugated metal sections---section%1:06:00:: or pre-cast concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: can be used for shelters---shelter%1:06:00:: either above or below ground---ground%1:17:00:: .
These are particularly suitable for regions---region%1:15:00:: where water---water%1:27:00:: or rock---rock%1:27:00:: is close to the surface---surface%1:17:00:: .
They form effective fallout shelters---fallout_shelter%1:06:00:: when mounded over with earth---earth%1:27:00:: , as shown in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 10---10%1:23:00:: .
Materials---material%1:27:00:: for this shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: would cost about $ 700 .
A contractor---contractor%1:18:00:: probably would be required to help build it .
His charges---charge%1:21:02:: would be added to the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of materials---material%1:27:00:: .
This shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: , as shown on page---page%1:10:00:: 24---24%1:23:00:: , would provide almost absolute protection---protection%1:04:00:: from fallout---fallout%1:27:00:: radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: .
An alternate hatchway---hatchway%1:06:00:: entrance---entrance%1:06:00:: , shown on page---page%1:10:00:: 25---25%1:23:00:: , would reduce the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of materials---material%1:27:00:: $ 50 to $ 100 .
The National Lumber Manufacturers Association---group%1:03:00:: , Washington---washington%1:15:01:: , D. C.---dc%1:15:00:: , is developing plans---plan%1:09:00:: to utilize specially treated lumber---lumber%1:27:00:: for underground shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: construction---construction%1:04:00:: .
The Structural Clay Products Institute---group%1:03:00:: , Washington---washington%1:15:01:: , D. C.---dc%1:15:00:: , is working to develop brick---brick%1:06:00:: and clay---clay%1:27:00:: products---product%1:06:01:: suitable for shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: construction---construction%1:04:00:: .
An underground reinforced concrete---reinforced_concrete%1:27:00:: shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: can be built by a contractor---contractor%1:18:00:: for about $ 1000 to $ 1500 , depending on the type---type%1:09:00:: of entrance---entrance%1:06:00:: .
The shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: shown would provide almost absolute fallout---fallout%1:27:00:: protection---protection%1:04:00:: .
The illustration---illustration%1:10:00:: ( fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 11---11%1:23:00:: ) shows this shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: with the roof---roof%1:06:00:: at ground level---ground_level%1:07:00:: and mounded over .
The same shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: could be built into an embankment---embankment%1:06:00:: or below ground level---ground_level%1:07:00:: .
Plans---plan%1:06:00:: for the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: , with either a stairway---stairway%1:06:00:: or hatchway---hatchway%1:06:00:: entrance---entrance%1:06:00:: , are shown on pages---page%1:10:00:: 26---26%1:23:00:: and 27---27%1:23:00:: .
Another type---type%1:09:00:: of shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: which gives excellent fallout---fallout%1:27:00:: protection---protection%1:04:00:: can be built as an added room---room%1:06:00:: to the basement---basement%1:06:00:: of a home---home%1:06:00:: under construction---construction%1:04:00:: .
It would add about $ 500 to the total cost---cost%1:21:00:: of the home---home%1:06:00:: .
The shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: illustrated in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 12---12%1:23:00:: is based on such a room---room%1:06:00:: built in a new home---home%1:06:00:: in the Washington---washington%1:15:01:: , D. C.---dc%1:15:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: in the Spring---spring%1:28:00:: of 1959 .
Important considerations---consideration%1:09:01:: common to each type---type%1:09:00:: of shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: are :
Arrangement---arrangement%1:07:00:: of the entrance---entrance%1:06:00:: .
Ventilation---ventilation%1:04:00:: .
Radio---radio%1:10:00:: reception---reception%1:10:00:: .
Lighting---lighting%1:26:00:: .
The entrance---entrance%1:06:00:: must have at least one right-angle---right_angle%1:25:00:: turn---turn%1:25:00:: .
Radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: scatters somewhat like light---light%1:19:00:: .
Some will go around a corner---corner%1:15:01:: .
The rest---rest%1:24:00:: continues in a straight line---straight_line%1:25:00:: .
Therefore , sharp turns---turn%1:25:00:: in a shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: entrance---entrance%1:06:00:: will reduce radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: inside the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: .
Ventilation---ventilation%1:04:00:: is provided in a concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: block---block%1:06:00:: basement---basement%1:06:00:: shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: by vents---vent%1:06:00:: in the wall---wall%1:06:00:: and by the open entrance---entrance%1:06:00:: .
A blower---blower%1:06:00:: may be installed to increase comfort---comfort%1:12:00:: .
A blower---blower%1:06:00:: is essential for the double wall---wall%1:06:00:: shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: and for the underground shelters---shelter%1:06:00:: .
It should provide not less than 5 cubic feet---cubic_foot%1:23:00:: per minute---minute%1:28:00:: of air---air%1:27:00:: per person---person%1:03:00:: .
Vent---vent%1:06:00:: pipes---pipe%1:06:00:: also are necessary ( as shown in figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 9---9%1:23:00:: , 10---10%1:23:00:: , and 11---11%1:23:00:: ) , but filters---filter%1:06:00:: are not .
Radio---radio%1:10:00:: reception---reception%1:10:00:: is cut down by the shielding---shielding%1:06:00:: necessary to keep out radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: .
As soon as the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: is completed a radio---radio%1:10:00:: reception---reception%1:10:00:: check---check%1:09:00:: must be made .
It probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: , particularly to receive CONELRAD broadcasts---broadcast%1:10:00:: .
Lighting---lighting%1:26:00:: is an important consideration---consideration%1:09:01:: .
Continuous low-level lighting---lighting%1:26:00:: may be provided in the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: by means of a 4 - cell---cell%1:06:00:: hot-shot battery---battery%1:06:00:: to which is wired a 150 - milliampere---milliampere%1:23:00:: flashlight---flashlight%1:06:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: bulb---bulb%1:06:00:: .
Tests---test%1:09:02:: have shown that such a device---device%1:06:00:: , with a fresh battery---battery%1:06:00:: , will furnish light---light%1:19:00:: continuously for at least 10 days---day%1:28:00:: .
With a spare battery---battery%1:06:00:: , a source---source%1:15:00:: of light---light%1:19:00:: for 2 weeks---week%1:28:00:: or more would be assured .
A flashlight---flashlight%1:06:00:: or electric lantern---lantern%1:06:00:: also should be available for those periods---period%1:28:00:: when a brighter light---light%1:06:00:: is needed .
There should be a regular electrical outlet---electric_outlet%1:06:00:: in the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: as power---power%1:19:00:: may continue in many areas---area%1:15:01:: .
Other considerations---consideration%1:09:01:: .
- If there are outside windows---window%1:06:00:: in the basement---basement%1:06:00:: corner---corner%1:06:02:: where you build a shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: , they should be shielded as shown in the Appendix---appendix%1:10:00:: , page---page%1:10:00:: 29---29%1:23:00:: .
Other basement---basement%1:06:00:: windows---window%1:06:00:: should be blocked when an emergency---emergency%1:11:00:: threatens .
Basement---basement%1:06:00:: walls---wall%1:06:00:: that project above the ground---ground%1:17:00:: should be shielded as shown in the Appendix---appendix%1:10:00:: , page---page%1:10:00:: 29---29%1:23:00:: .
In these shelters---shelter%1:06:00:: the entrance---entrance%1:06:00:: should be not more than 2 feet---foot%1:23:00:: wide .
Bunks---bunk%1:06:00:: , or materials---material%1:27:00:: to build them , may have to be put inside the enclosure---enclosure%1:06:00:: before the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: walls---wall%1:06:00:: are completed .
The basement---basement%1:06:00:: or belowground shelters---shelter%1:06:00:: also will serve for tornado---tornado%1:19:00:: or hurricane---hurricane%1:19:00:: protection---protection%1:04:00:: .
The radioactivity of fallout---fallout%1:27:00:: decays rapidly at first .
Forty-nine hours---hour%1:28:00:: after an atomic burst---burst%1:04:00:: the radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: is only about 1 percent---percent%1:24:00:: of what it was an hour---hour%1:28:00:: after the explosion---explosion%1:11:00:: .
But the radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: may be so intense at the start that one percent---one_percent%1:23:00:: may be extremely dangerous .
Therefore , civil defense---civil_defense%1:04:00:: instructions---instruction%1:10:04:: received over CONELRAD or by other means---means%1:04:00:: should be followed .
A battery---battery%1:06:00:: powered radio---radio%1:06:01:: is essential .
Radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: suitable for home---home%1:06:00:: use---use%1:04:00:: are available , and would be of value in locating that portion---portion%1:24:00:: of the home---home%1:06:00:: which offers the best protection---protection%1:04:00:: against fallout---fallout%1:27:00:: radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: .
There is a possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: that battery---battery%1:06:00:: powered radios---radio%1:06:01:: with built-in radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: meters---meter%1:06:00:: may become available .
One instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: thus would serve both purposes---purpose%1:07:00:: .
Your local civil defense---civil_defense%1:04:00:: will gather its own information---information%1:09:00:: and will receive broad information---information%1:10:00:: from State and Federal sources---source%1:10:00:: .
How long to stay in your shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: .
You should be prepared to stay in your shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: full time for at least several days---day%1:28:00:: and to make it your home---home%1:06:00:: for 14 days---day%1:28:00:: or longer .
A checklist---checklist%1:10:00:: in the Appendix---appendix%1:10:00:: , ( page---page%1:10:00:: 30---30%1:23:00:: ) tells what is needed .
Families---family%1:14:02:: with children---child%1:18:00:: will have particular problems---problem%1:26:00:: .
They should provide for simple recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: .
There should be a task---task%1:04:00:: for everyone and these tasks---task%1:04:00:: should be rotated .
Part---part%1:24:00:: of the family---family%1:14:02:: should be sleeping while the rest---rest%1:24:00:: is awake .
To break the monotony---monotony%1:07:00:: it may be necessary to invent tasks---task%1:04:00:: that will keep the family---family%1:14:02:: busy .
Records---record%1:10:03:: such as diaries---diary%1:10:00:: can be kept .
The survival---survival%1:26:00:: of the family---family%1:14:02:: will depend largely on information---information%1:10:00:: received by radio---radio%1:06:01:: .
A record---record%1:10:03:: should be kept of the information---information%1:10:00:: and instructions---instruction%1:10:04:: , including the time---time%1:28:03:: and date---date%1:28:00:: of broadcast---broadcast%1:10:00:: .
Family---family%1:14:02:: rationing---rationing%1:04:00:: probably will be necessary .
Blowers---blower%1:06:00:: should be operated periodically on a regular schedule---schedule%1:09:00:: .
There will come a time---time%1:11:00:: in a basement---basement%1:06:00:: shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: when the radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: has decayed enough to allow use---use%1:04:00:: of the whole basement---basement%1:06:00:: .
However , as much time---time%1:28:05:: as possible should be spent within the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: to hold radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: exposure---exposure%1:07:00:: to a minimum---minimum%1:23:00:: .
The housekeeping---housekeeping%1:04:00:: problems---problem%1:26:00:: of living in a shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: will begin as soon as the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: is occupied .
Food---food%1:03:00:: , medical supplies , utensils---utensil%1:06:00:: , and equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: , if not already stored in the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: , must be quickly gathered up and carried into it .
After the family---family%1:14:02:: has settled in the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: , the housekeeping---housekeeping%1:04:00:: rules---rule%1:10:00:: should be spelled out by the adult---adult%1:18:00:: in charge---charge%1:04:00:: .
Sanitation---sanitation%1:26:00:: in the confines---confines%1:07:00:: of the family---family%1:14:02:: shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: will require much thought---thought%1:09:00:: and planning---planning%1:04:00:: .
Provision---provision%1:04:01:: for emergency---emergency%1:11:00:: toilet---toilet%1:06:01:: facilities---facility%1:06:00:: and disposal---disposal%1:04:00:: of human wastes---human_waste%1:27:00:: will be an unfamiliar problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
A covered container---container%1:06:00:: such as a kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: garbage---garbage%1:27:00:: pail---pail%1:06:00:: might do as a toilet---toilet%1:06:01:: .
A 10 - gallon---gallon%1:23:01:: garbage can---garbage_can%1:06:00:: , with a tightly fitting cover---cover%1:06:03:: , could be used to keep the wastes---waste%1:27:00:: until it is safe to leave the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: .
Water---water%1:27:00:: rationing---rationing%1:04:00:: will be difficult and should be planned carefully .
A portable electric heater---electric_heater%1:06:00:: is advisable for shelters---shelter%1:06:00:: in cold climates---climate%1:26:00:: .
It would take the chill---chill%1:07:00:: from the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: in the beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: .
Even if the electric power---electric_power%1:19:00:: fails after an attack---attack%1:04:00:: , any time---time%1:28:05:: that the heater---heater%1:06:00:: has been used will make the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: that much more comfortable .
Body---body%1:08:00:: heat---heat%1:09:00:: in the close quarters---quarters%1:06:00:: will help keep up the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: .
Warm clothing---clothing%1:06:00:: and bedding---bedding%1:06:00:: , of course , are essential .
Open flame---flame%1:22:00:: heating---heating%1:22:00:: or cooking---cooking%1:04:00:: should be avoided .
A flame---flame%1:22:00:: would use up air---air%1:27:00:: .
Some families---family%1:14:02:: already have held weekend---weekend%1:28:00:: rehearsals---rehearsal%1:04:01:: in their home---home%1:06:00:: shelters---shelter%1:06:00:: to learn the problems---problem%1:26:00:: and to determine for themselves what supplies they would need .
Few areas---area%1:15:01:: , if any , are as good as prepared shelters---shelter%1:06:00:: but they are worth knowing about .
A family---family%1:14:02:: dwelling---dwelling%1:06:00:: without a basement---basement%1:06:00:: provides some natural shielding---shielding%1:04:00:: from fallout---fallout%1:27:00:: radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: .
On the ground floor---ground_floor%1:06:00:: the radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: would be about half---half%1:23:00:: what it is outside .
The best protection---protection%1:04:00:: would be on the ground floor---ground_floor%1:06:00:: in the central part---part%1:24:00:: of the house---house%1:06:00:: .
A belowground basement---basement%1:06:00:: can cut the fallout---fallout%1:27:00:: radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: to one tenth---tenth%1:23:00:: of the outside level---level%1:07:00:: .
The safest place---place%1:15:00:: is the basement---basement%1:06:00:: corner---corner%1:06:02:: least exposed to windows---window%1:06:00:: and deepest below ground---ground%1:17:00:: .
If there is time---time%1:28:05:: after the warning---warning%1:10:00:: , the basement---basement%1:06:00:: shielding---shielding%1:06:00:: could be improved substantially by blocking windows---window%1:06:00:: with bricks---brick%1:06:00:: , dirt---dirt%1:27:01:: , books---book%1:06:00:: , magazines---magazine%1:06:02:: , or other heavy material---material%1:27:00:: .
Large apartment buildings---apartment_building%1:06:00:: of masonry---masonry%1:06:00:: or concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: provide better natural shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: than the usual family---family%1:14:02:: dwellings---dwelling%1:06:00:: .
In general , such apartments---apartment%1:06:00:: afford more protection---protection%1:04:00:: than smaller buildings---building%1:06:00:: because their walls---wall%1:06:00:: are thick and there is more space---space%1:25:00:: .
The central area---area%1:15:01:: of the ground floor---ground_floor%1:06:00:: of a heavily constructed apartment building---apartment_building%1:06:00:: , with concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: floors---floor%1:06:00:: , should provide more fallout---fallout%1:27:00:: protection---protection%1:04:00:: than the ordinary basement---basement%1:06:00:: of a family---family%1:14:02:: dwelling---dwelling%1:06:00:: .
The basement---basement%1:06:00:: of such an apartment building---apartment_building%1:06:00:: may provide as much natural protection---protection%1:04:00:: as the specially constructed concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: block---block%1:06:00:: shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: recommended for the basement---basement%1:06:00:: of a family---family%1:14:02:: dwelling---dwelling%1:06:00:: .
The Federal Government---federal_government%1:14:00:: is aiding local governments---local_government%1:14:00:: in several places---place%1:15:00:: to survey residential , commercial and industrial buildings---building%1:06:00:: to determine what fallout---fallout%1:27:00:: protection---protection%1:04:00:: they would provide , and for how many people---person%1:03:00:: .
The problem---problem%1:26:00:: for the city---city%1:15:00:: apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: dweller---dweller%1:18:00:: is primarily to plan the use---use%1:04:00:: of existing space---space%1:25:00:: .
Such planning---planning%1:04:00:: will require the cooperation---cooperation%1:04:01:: of other occupants---occupant%1:18:00:: and of the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: management---management%1:14:00:: .
In Poughkeepsie---location%1:03:00:: , N. Y.---location%1:03:00:: , in 1952 , a Roman Catholic---roman_catholic%1:14:00:: hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: presented seven Protestant physicians---physician%1:18:00:: with an ultimatum---ultimatum%1:10:00:: to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation---group%1:03:00:: or to resign from the hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: staff---staff%1:14:01:: .
After a flood---flood%1:23:00:: of protests---protest%1:10:00:: , they were reinstated at the beginning---beginning%1:28:00:: of 1953 .
The peace---peace%1:26:01:: of the community---community%1:14:00:: was badly disturbed , and people---people%1:14:00:: across the nation , reading of the incident---incident%1:11:00:: , felt uneasy .
In New York City---new_york_city%1:15:00:: in 1958 , the city---city%1:15:00:: 's Commissioner---commissioner%1:18:00:: of Hospitals---hospital%1:06:00:: refused to permit a physician---physician%1:18:00:: to provide a Protestant mother---mother%1:18:00:: with a contraceptive device---contraceptive_device%1:06:00:: .
He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy---controversy%1:10:00:: involving Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: , Jews---jew%1:18:00:: and Roman Catholics---roman_catholic%1:18:00:: that continued for two months---month%1:28:00:: , until the city---city%1:15:00:: 's Board---board%1:14:00:: of Hospitals---hospital%1:06:00:: lifted the ban---ban%1:10:00:: on birth-control---birth_control%1:04:00:: therapy---therapy%1:04:00:: .
A year---year%1:28:01:: later in Albany---albany%1:15:00:: , N. Y.---location%1:03:00:: , a Roman Catholic---roman_catholic%1:14:00:: hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: barred an orthopedic surgeon---surgeon%1:18:00:: because of his connection---connection%1:24:00:: with the Planned Parenthood Association---group%1:03:00:: .
Immediately , the religious groups---group%1:03:00:: of the city---city%1:15:00:: were embroiled in an angry dispute---dispute%1:10:00:: over the alleged invasion---invasion%1:11:00:: of a man---man%1:18:04:: 's right---right%1:07:00:: to freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: of religious belief---religious_belief%1:09:00:: and conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: .
These incidents---incident%1:11:00:: , typical of many others , dramatize the distressing fact---fact%1:10:01:: that no controversy---controversy%1:10:00:: during the last several decades---decade%1:28:00:: has caused more tension---tension%1:26:03:: , rancor---rancor%1:12:00:: and strife---strife%1:04:00:: among religious groups---group%1:03:00:: in this country---country%1:14:00:: than the birth-control---birth_control%1:04:00:: issue---issue%1:09:01:: .
It has flared up periodically on the front pages---page%1:10:00:: of newspapers---newspaper%1:10:00:: in communities---community%1:14:00:: divided over birth---birth%1:28:00:: prevention---prevention%1:04:00:: regulations---regulation%1:10:00:: in municipal hospitals---hospital%1:06:00:: and health---health%1:26:00:: and family---family%1:14:00:: welfare---welfare%1:04:00:: agencies---agency%1:14:00:: .
It has erupted on the national level---level%1:26:00:: in the matter---matter%1:09:00:: of including birth-control---birth_control%1:04:00:: information---information%1:10:00:: and material---material%1:06:01:: in foreign aid---aid%1:21:00:: to underdeveloped countries---country%1:14:00:: .
Where it is not actually erupting , it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment---resentment%1:12:00:: like a volcano---volcano%1:17:01:: , ready to explode at any moment---moment%1:28:00:: .
The time---time%1:28:06:: has come for citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: of all faiths---faith%1:14:00:: to unite in an effort---effort%1:04:00:: to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue---issue%1:09:01:: from the political and social life---life%1:26:01:: of our nation---nation%1:14:00:: .
The first step---first_step%1:04:00:: toward the goal---goal%1:09:00:: is the establishment---establishment%1:04:00:: of a new atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: of mutual good will---good_will%1:07:00:: and friendly communication---communication%1:10:01:: on other than the polemical level---level%1:26:00:: .
Instead of emotional recrimination---recrimination%1:10:00:: , loaded phrases---phrase%1:10:00:: and sloganeering---sloganeering%1:10:00:: , we need a dispassionate study---study%1:04:00:: of the facts---fact%1:09:01:: , a better understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of the opposite viewpoint---viewpoint%1:09:00:: and a more serious effort---effort%1:04:00:: to extend the areas---area%1:09:00:: of agreement---agreement%1:26:01:: until a solution---solution%1:10:00:: is reached .
`` All too frequently '' , points out James O' Gara---person%1:03:00:: , managing editor---managing_editor%1:18:00:: of Commonweal , `` Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: run roughshod over Protestant sensibilities---sensibility%1:12:00:: in this matter---matter%1:09:00:: , by failure---failure%1:04:00:: to consider the reasoning---reasoning%1:09:00:: behind the Protestant position---position%1:09:00:: and , particularly , by their jibes---jibe%1:10:00:: at the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that Protestant opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: on birth control---birth_control%1:04:00:: has changed in recent decades---decade%1:28:00:: '' .
All too often our language---language%1:10:01:: is unduly harsh .
The second step---step%1:04:02:: is to recognize the substantial agreement---agreement%1:26:01:: - frequently blurred by emotionalism---emotionalism%1:07:00:: and inaccurate newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: reporting---reporting%1:10:00:: - already existing between Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: and non-Catholics---non-catholic%1:18:00:: concerning the over-all objectives---objective%1:09:00:: of family planning---family_planning%1:04:00:: .
Instead of Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: ' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number---number%1:07:00:: of offspring---offspring%1:18:00:: , as many non-Catholics---non-catholic%1:18:00:: imagine , the ideal---ideal%1:09:00:: of responsible parenthood---parenthood%1:26:00:: is stressed .
Family planning---family_planning%1:04:00:: is encouraged , so that parents---parent%1:18:00:: will be able to provide properly for their offspring---offspring%1:18:00:: .
Pope Pius 12---person%1:03:00:: , declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation---obligation%1:04:00:: of parenthood---parenthood%1:26:00:: for a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: and even for the whole duration---duration%1:28:02:: of married life---life%1:26:01:: , if there are serious reasons---reason%1:16:00:: , such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical , eugenic , economic and social `` indications---indication%1:10:00:: '' .
This means that such factors---factor%1:11:00:: as the health---health%1:26:00:: of the parents---parent%1:18:00:: , particularly the mother---mother%1:18:00:: , their ability---ability%1:07:00:: to provide their children---child%1:18:01:: with the necessities---necessity%1:17:00:: of life---life%1:09:00:: , the degree---degree%1:07:00:: of population---population%1:14:01:: density---density%1:07:00:: of a country---country%1:14:00:: and the shortage---shortage%1:07:00:: of housing---housing%1:06:00:: facilities---facility%1:06:00:: may legitimately be taken into consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: in determining the number---number%1:23:00:: of offspring---offspring%1:18:00:: .
These are substantially the same factors---factor%1:11:00:: considered by non-Catholics---non-catholic%1:18:00:: in family planning---family_planning%1:04:00:: .
The laws---law%1:14:00:: of many states---state%1:15:01:: permit birth control---birth_control%1:04:00:: only for medical reasons---reason%1:16:00:: .
The Roman Catholic Church---roman_catholic_church%1:14:00:: , however , sanctions a much more liberal policy---policy%1:09:00:: on family planning---family_planning%1:04:00:: .
Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: , Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: and Jews---jew%1:18:00:: are in agreement over the objectives---objective%1:09:00:: of family planning---family_planning%1:04:00:: , but disagree over the methods---method%1:09:00:: to be used .
The Roman Catholic Church---roman_catholic_church%1:14:00:: sanctions only abstention---abstention%1:07:00:: or the rhythm method---rhythm_method%1:04:00:: , also known as the use---use%1:04:00:: of the infertile or safe period---period%1:28:00:: .
The Church---roman_catholic_church%1:14:00:: considers this to be the method---method%1:09:00:: provided by nature---nature%1:17:00:: and its divine Author---author%1:18:01:: : It involves no frustration---frustration%1:04:02:: of nature---nature%1:17:00:: 's laws---law%1:09:00:: , but simply an intelligent and disciplined use---use%1:04:00:: of them .
With the exception---exception%1:09:00:: of the Roman Catholic---roman_catholic_church%1:14:00:: and the Orthodox Catholic Churches---orthodox_catholic_church%1:14:00:: , most churches---church%1:14:00:: make no moral distinction---distinction%1:09:00:: between rhythm---rhythm%1:04:00:: and mechanical or chemical contraceptives---contraceptive%1:06:00:: , allowing the couple---couple%1:14:01:: free choice---choice%1:04:00:: .
Here is a difference---difference%1:07:00:: in theological belief where there seems little chance---chance%1:26:00:: of agreement---agreement%1:26:01:: .
The grounds---ground%1:16:00:: for the Church---roman_catholic_church%1:14:00:: 's position---position%1:09:00:: are Scriptural ( Old Testament---old_testament%1:10:00:: ) , the teachings---teaching%1:09:00:: of the fathers---father%1:18:04:: and doctors---doctor%1:18:02:: of the early Church---roman_catholic_church%1:14:00:: , the unbroken tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: of nineteen centuries---century%1:28:00:: , the decisions---decision%1:09:00:: of the highest ecclesiastical authority---authority%1:18:01:: and the natural law---natural_law%1:09:00:: .
The latter plays a prominent role---role%1:04:00:: in Roman Catholic---roman_catholic%1:14:00:: theology---theology%1:09:00:: and is considered decisive , entirely apart from Scripture---scripture%1:10:00:: , in determining the ethical character---character%1:09:00:: of birth-prevention---birth_prevention%1:04:00:: methods---method%1:09:00:: .
The Roman Catholic---roman_catholic%1:14:00:: natural-law---natural_law%1:09:00:: tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: of the conjugal act---act%1:03:00:: is procreation---procreation%1:04:00:: and that the fostering---fostering%1:10:00:: of the mutual love---love%1:12:00:: of the spouses---spouse%1:18:00:: is the secondary and subjective end---end%1:09:02:: .
This conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: is based on two propositions---proposition%1:10:00:: : that man---man%1:18:04:: by the use---use%1:04:00:: of his reason---reason%1:09:00:: can ascertain God---god%1:18:00:: 's purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: in the universe---universe%1:17:00:: and that God---god%1:18:00:: makes known His purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: by certain `` given '' physical arrangements---arrangement%1:09:00:: .
Thus , man---man%1:18:04:: can readily deduce that the primary objective end---end%1:09:02:: of the conjugal act---act%1:03:00:: is procreation---procreation%1:04:00:: , the propagation---propagation%1:04:00:: of the race .
Moreover , man---man%1:18:04:: may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements---arrangement%1:09:00:: established by God---god%1:18:00:: , who through the law---law%1:09:01:: of rhythm---rhythm%1:07:01:: has provided a natural method---method%1:09:00:: for the control---control%1:04:02:: of conception---conception%1:04:01:: .
Believing that God---god%1:18:00:: is the Author---author%1:18:01:: of this law---law%1:09:01:: and of all laws of nature---law_of_nature%1:09:00:: , Roman Catholics---roman_catholic%1:18:00:: believe that they are obliged to obey those laws---law%1:09:00:: , not frustrate or mock them .
Let it be granted then that the theological differences---difference%1:07:00:: in this area---area%1:09:00:: between Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: and Roman Catholics---roman_catholic%1:18:00:: appear to be irreconcilable .
But people---people%1:14:00:: differ in their religious beliefs---religious_belief%1:09:00:: on scores---scores%1:23:00:: of doctrines---doctrine%1:09:00:: , without taking up arms against those who disagree with them .
Why is it so different in regard to birth control---birth_control%1:04:00:: ?
It is because each side---side%1:14:00:: has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation---legislation%1:04:00:: and thus indirectly force its belief , or at least the practical consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: thereof , upon others .
It is always a temptation---temptation%1:09:00:: for a religious organization---organization%1:14:00:: , especially a powerful or dominant one , to impose through the clenched fist of the law---law%1:14:00:: its creedal viewpoint---viewpoint%1:09:00:: upon others .
Both Roman Catholics---roman_catholic%1:18:00:: and Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: have succumbed to this temptation---temptation%1:09:00:: in the past---past%1:28:00:: .
Consider what happened during World War 1 , , when the Protestant churches---church%1:14:00:: united to push the Prohibition---prohibition%1:10:02:: law---law%1:10:00:: through Congress---congress%1:14:01:: .
Many of them sincerely believe that the use---use%1:04:00:: of liquor---liquor%1:13:00:: in any form---form%1:09:01:: or in any degree---degree%1:07:00:: is intrinsically evil and sinful .
With over four million American men---man%1:18:00:: away at war---war%1:04:00:: , Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public---public%1:14:01:: .
With the return---return%1:04:01:: of our soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: , it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority---majority%1:07:00:: of citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: .
The attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to enforce that belief ushered in a reign---reign%1:28:01:: of bootleggers---bootlegger%1:18:00:: , racketeers---racketeer%1:18:00:: , hijackers---hijacker%1:18:00:: and gangsters---gangster%1:18:00:: that led to a breakdown---breakdown%1:04:02:: of law---law%1:14:00:: unparalleled in our history---history%1:28:02:: .
The so-called `` noble experiment---experiment%1:04:01:: '' came to an inglorious end---end%1:26:00:: .
That tumultuous , painful and costly experience---experience%1:11:00:: shows clearly that a law---law%1:10:00:: expressing a moral judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence---correspondence%1:07:02:: with the general view---view%1:09:02:: of society---society%1:14:00:: .
That experience---experience%1:11:00:: holds a lesson---lesson%1:10:00:: for us all in regard to birth control---birth_control%1:04:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: .
Up to the turn of the century---turn_of_the_century%1:28:00:: , contraception---contraception%1:04:00:: was condemned by all Christian churches---christian_church%1:14:00:: as immoral , unnatural and contrary to divine law---divine_law%1:09:00:: .
This was generally reflected in the civil laws---civil_law%1:14:00:: of Christian countries---country%1:14:00:: .
Today---today%1:28:00:: , the Roman Catholic---roman_catholic_church%1:14:00:: and Orthodox Churches---orthodox_church%1:14:00:: stand virtually alone in holding that conviction---conviction%1:09:00:: .
The various Lambeth Conferences , expressing the Anglican viewpoint---viewpoint%1:09:00:: , mirror the gradual change---change%1:11:00:: that has taken place among Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: generally .
In 1920 , the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation---condemnation%1:10:00:: of contraception---contraception%1:04:00:: and issued `` an emphatic warning---warning%1:10:01:: against the use---use%1:04:00:: of unnatural means---means%1:06:00:: for the avoidance---avoidance%1:04:00:: of conception---conception%1:04:01:: , together with the grave dangers---danger%1:04:00:: - physical , moral , and religious - thereby incurred , and against the evils---evil%1:07:02:: which the extension---extension%1:10:01:: of such use---use%1:04:00:: threaten the race '' .
Denouncing the view---view%1:09:02:: that the sexual union---sexual_union%1:04:00:: is an end---end%1:09:02:: in itself , the Conference declared : `` We steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations---consideration%1:09:01:: of Christian marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: .
One is the primary purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: for which marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: exists , namely , the continuance---continuance%1:04:00:: of the race through the gift---gift%1:21:00:: and heritage---heritage%1:07:00:: of children---child%1:18:01:: ; the other is the paramount importance---importance%1:26:00:: in married life---life%1:26:01:: of deliberate and thoughtful self-control---self-control%1:04:00:: '' .
The Conference called for a vigorous campaign---campaign%1:04:02:: against the open or secret sale---sale%1:04:02:: of contraceptives---contraceptive%1:06:00:: .
In 1930 , the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: of marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: to be the procreation---procreation%1:04:00:: of children---child%1:18:01:: , but conceded that , in certain limited circumstances---circumstance%1:26:02:: , contraception---contraception%1:04:00:: might be morally legitimate .
In 1958 , the Conference endorsed birth control---birth_control%1:04:00:: as the responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: laid by God---god%1:18:00:: on parents---parent%1:18:00:: everywhere .
Many other Protestant denominations---protestant_denomination%1:14:00:: preceded the Anglicans---anglican%1:18:00:: in such action---action%1:04:02:: .
In March---march%1:28:00:: , 1931 , 22 out of 28 members---member%1:18:00:: of a committee---committee%1:14:00:: of the Federal Council of Churches---group%1:03:00:: ratified artificial methods---method%1:09:00:: of birth control---birth_control%1:04:00:: .
`` As to the necessity---necessity%1:26:00:: '' , the committee---committee%1:14:00:: declared , `` for some form---form%1:09:01:: of effective control---control%1:24:00:: of the size---size%1:07:00:: of the family---family%1:14:00:: and the spacing---spacing%1:28:00:: of children---child%1:18:01:: , and consequently of control---control%1:04:02:: of conception---conception%1:04:01:: , there can be no question---question%1:07:00:: .
There is general agreement also that sex---sex%1:04:00:: union---union%1:04:02:: between husbands---husband%1:18:00:: and wives---wife%1:18:00:: as an expression---expression%1:10:02:: of mutual affection---mutual_affection%1:24:00:: without relation to procreation---procreation%1:04:00:: is right '' .
Since then , many Protestant denominations---protestant_denomination%1:14:00:: have made separate pronouncements---pronouncement%1:10:00:: , in which they not only approved birth control---birth_control%1:04:00:: , but declared it at times to be a religious duty---duty%1:04:00:: .
What determines the morality---morality%1:07:00:: , they state , is not the means---means%1:04:00:: used , but the motive---motive%1:03:00:: .
In general , the means---means%1:04:00:: ( excluding abortion---abortion%1:04:00:: ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical .
This development---development%1:11:01:: is reflected in the action---action%1:04:02:: taken in February---february%1:28:00:: , 1961 , by the general board---board%1:14:00:: of the National Council of Churches---group%1:03:00:: , the largest Protestant organization---organization%1:14:01:: in the US---us%1:15:00:: .
The board---board%1:14:00:: approved and commended the use---use%1:04:00:: of birth-control---birth_control%1:04:00:: devices---device%1:06:00:: as a part---part%1:24:00:: of Christian responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: in family planning---family_planning%1:04:00:: .
It called for opposition---opposition%1:04:01:: to laws---law%1:14:00:: and institutional practices---practice%1:04:00:: restricting the information---information%1:09:00:: or availability---availability%1:07:00:: of contraceptives---contraceptive%1:06:00:: .
The general board---board%1:14:00:: declared : `` Most of the Protestant---protestant%1:14:00:: churches---church%1:14:00:: hold contraception---contraception%1:04:00:: and periodic continence---continence%1:07:00:: to be morally right when the motives---motive%1:03:00:: are right .
The general Protestant---protestant%1:14:00:: conviction---conviction%1:09:00:: is that motives---motive%1:03:00:: , rather than methods---method%1:09:00:: , form the primary moral issue---issue%1:09:01:: , provided the methods---method%1:09:00:: are limited to the prevention---prevention%1:04:00:: of conception---conception%1:04:01:: '' .
An action---action%1:04:02:: once universally condemned by all Christian churches---christian_church%1:14:00:: and forbidden by the civil law---civil_law%1:14:00:: is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority---majority%1:07:00:: of Protestant denominations---protestant_denomination%1:14:00:: , but also deemed , at certain times---time%1:11:00:: , to be a positive religious duty---duty%1:04:00:: .
This viewpoint---viewpoint%1:09:00:: has now been translated into action---action%1:04:02:: by the majority---majority%1:07:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: in this country---country%1:14:00:: .
Repeated polls---poll%1:09:00:: have disclosed that most married couples---married_couple%1:14:00:: are now using contraceptives---contraceptive%1:06:00:: in the practice---practice%1:04:00:: of birth control---birth_control%1:04:00:: .
For all concerned with social-welfare---social_welfare%1:04:00:: legislation---legislation%1:10:00:: , the significance---significance%1:09:01:: of this radical and revolutionary change---change%1:24:00:: in the thought---thought%1:09:02:: and habits---habit%1:09:00:: of the vast majority---majority%1:07:00:: of the American people---people%1:14:00:: is clear , profound and far reaching .
To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction---conviction%1:09:00:: of such a majority---majority%1:07:00:: by a legislative fiat---fiat%1:10:00:: would be to invite the same breakdown---breakdown%1:04:02:: of law---law%1:14:00:: and order---order%1:26:00:: that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition---prohibition%1:10:02:: experiment---experiment%1:04:01:: .
This brings us to the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that the realities---reality%1:26:02:: we are dealing with lie not in the field---field%1:26:00:: of civil legislation---legislation%1:10:00:: , but in the realm---realm%1:26:01:: of conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: and religion---religion%1:09:00:: : They are moral judgments---judgment%1:09:04:: and matters---matter%1:09:00:: of theological belief .
Conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: and religion---religion%1:09:00:: are concerned with private sin---sin%1:04:00:: : The civil law---civil_law%1:14:00:: is concerned with public crimes---crime%1:04:00:: .
Only confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: , failure---failure%1:04:00:: and anarchy---anarchy%1:26:00:: result when the effort---effort%1:04:00:: is made to impose upon the civil authority---civil_authority%1:18:00:: the impossible task---task%1:04:00:: of policing private homes---home%1:15:04:: to preclude the possibility---possibility%1:09:01:: of sin---sin%1:04:00:: .
Among the chief victims---victim%1:18:00:: of such an ill conceived imposition---imposition%1:04:02:: would be religion---religion%1:14:00:: itself .
If you elect to use the Standard Deduction---deduction%1:21:01:: or the Tax---tax%1:21:00:: Table---table%1:14:00:: , and later find you should have itemized your deductions---deduction%1:21:01:: , you may do so by filing an amended return---amended_return%1:10:00:: within the time---time%1:28:05:: prescribed for filing a claim---claim%1:04:00:: for refund---refund%1:21:00:: .
See You May Claim a Refund , Page---page%1:10:00:: 135 .
The same is true if you have itemized your deductions---deduction%1:21:01:: and later decide you should have used the Standard Deduction---deduction%1:21:01:: or Tax---tax%1:21:00:: Table---table%1:14:00:: .
The words---word%1:10:00:: amended return---amended_return%1:10:00:: should be plainly written across the top---top%1:15:01:: of such return---return%1:10:01:: .
April---april%1:28:00:: 15 is usually the final date---date%1:28:00:: for filing income tax returns---income_tax_return%1:10:00:: for most people---people%1:14:00:: because they use the calendar year---calendar_year%1:28:00:: ending on December---december%1:28:00:: 31 .
If you use a fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: , a year---year%1:28:02:: ending on the last day---day%1:28:00:: of any month---month%1:28:01:: other than December---december%1:28:00:: , your return---return%1:10:01:: is due on or before the 15 th day---day%1:28:00:: of the 4 th month---month%1:28:01:: after the close---close%1:28:00:: of your tax---tax%1:21:00:: year---year%1:28:02:: .
If the last day---day%1:28:00:: ( due date---due_date%1:28:00:: ) for performing any act---act%1:03:00:: for tax---tax%1:21:00:: purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: , such as filing---filing%1:10:00:: a return---return%1:10:01:: or making a tax---tax%1:21:00:: payment---payment%1:21:00:: , etc. , falls on Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: , Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: , or a legal holiday---legal_holiday%1:28:00:: , you may perform that act---act%1:03:00:: on the next succeeding day---day%1:28:00:: which is not a Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: , Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: , or legal holiday---legal_holiday%1:28:00:: .
Since April---april%1:28:00:: 15 , 1962 , is on Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: your return---return%1:10:01:: for the calendar year---calendar_year%1:28:00:: 1961 will be timely filed if it is filed on or before Monday---monday%1:28:00:: , April---april%1:28:00:: 16 , 1962 .
If you mail a return---return%1:10:01:: or tax---tax%1:21:00:: payment---payment%1:21:00:: , you must place it in the mails---mail%1:10:00:: in ample time---time%1:28:05:: to reach the district---district%1:15:00:: director---director%1:18:00:: on or before the due date---due_date%1:28:00:: .
If you were required to file a declaration of estimated tax---declaration_of_estimated_tax%1:10:00:: for the calendar year---calendar_year%1:28:00:: 1961 , it is not necessary to pay the fourth installment---installment%1:21:00:: otherwise due on January---january%1:28:00:: 15 , 1962 , if you file your income tax return---income_tax_return%1:10:00:: Form 1040 , and pay your tax---tax%1:21:00:: in full for the calendar year---calendar_year%1:28:00:: 1961 by January---january%1:28:00:: 31 , 1962 .
The filing---filing%1:10:00:: of an original or amended declaration---declaration%1:10:02:: , otherwise due on January---january%1:28:00:: 15 , 1962 , is also waived , if you file your Form 1040 for 1961 and pay the full tax---tax%1:21:00:: by January---january%1:28:00:: 31 , 1962 .
Farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: , for these purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: , have until February---february%1:28:00:: 15 , 1962 , to file Form 1040 and pay the tax---tax%1:21:00:: in full for the calendar year---calendar_year%1:28:00:: 1961 .
Fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: taxpayers---taxpayer%1:18:00:: have until the last day---day%1:28:00:: of the first month---month%1:28:01:: following the close---close%1:28:00:: of the fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: ( farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: until the 15 th day---day%1:28:00:: of the 2 d month---month%1:28:01:: ) .
See Chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: 38 .
Nonresident aliens---alien%1:18:00:: living in Canada---canada%1:15:00:: or Mexico---mexico%1:15:00:: who earn wages---wage%1:21:00:: in the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: may be subject to withholding---withholding%1:04:00:: of tax---tax%1:21:00:: on their wages---wage%1:21:00:: , the same as if they were citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
Their United States---united_states%1:15:00:: tax returns---tax_return%1:10:00:: are due April---april%1:28:00:: 16 , 1962 .
However , if their United States---united_states%1:15:00:: income---income%1:21:00:: is not subject to the withholding---withholding%1:04:00:: of tax---tax%1:21:00:: on wages---wage%1:21:00:: , their returns---return%1:10:01:: are due June---june%1:28:00:: 15 , 1962 , if they use a calendar year---calendar_year%1:28:00:: , or the 15 th day---day%1:28:00:: of the 6 th month---month%1:28:01:: after the close---close%1:28:00:: of their fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: .
If you are a nonresident alien---alien%1:18:00:: and a resident---resident%1:18:00:: of Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: , your return---return%1:10:01:: is also due June---june%1:28:00:: 15 , 1962 , or the 15 th day---day%1:28:00:: of the 6 th month---month%1:28:01:: after the close---close%1:28:00:: of your fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: .
If a taxpayer---taxpayer%1:18:00:: dies , the executor---executor%1:18:00:: , administrator---administrator%1:18:01:: , or legal representative---representative%1:18:00:: must file the final return---return%1:10:01:: for the decedent---decedent%1:18:00:: on or before the 15 th day---day%1:28:00:: of the 4 th month---month%1:28:01:: following the close---close%1:28:00:: of the deceased taxpayer---taxpayer%1:18:00:: 's normal tax---tax%1:21:00:: year---year%1:28:02:: .
Suppose John Jones---person%1:03:00:: , who , for 1960 , filed on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of a calendar year---calendar_year%1:28:00:: , died June---june%1:28:00:: 20 , 1961 .
His return---return%1:10:01:: for the period---period%1:28:00:: January---january%1:28:00:: 1 to June---june%1:28:00:: 20 , 1961 , is due April---april%1:28:00:: 16 , 1962 .
The return---return%1:10:01:: for a decedent---decedent%1:18:00:: may also serve as a claim---claim%1:04:00:: for refund---refund%1:04:00:: of an overpayment---overpayment%1:21:00:: of tax---tax%1:21:00:: .
In such a case---case%1:26:00:: , Form 1310 should be completed and attached to the return---return%1:10:01:: .
This form---form%1:10:01:: may be obtained from the local office---office%1:14:01:: of your district---district%1:15:00:: director---director%1:18:00:: .
Returns---return%1:10:01:: of estates---estate%1:21:02:: or trusts---trust%1:21:03:: are due on or before the 15 th day---day%1:28:00:: of the 4 th month---month%1:28:01:: after the close---close%1:28:00:: of the tax---tax%1:21:00:: year---year%1:28:02:: .
Under unusual circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: a resident individual---individual%1:03:00:: may be granted an extension---extension%1:28:00:: of time---time%1:28:05:: to file a return---return%1:10:01:: .
You may apply for such an extension---extension%1:28:00:: by filing Form 2688 , Application For Extension Of Time To File , with the District Director of Internal Revenue---person%1:03:00:: for your district---district%1:15:00:: , or you may make your application---application%1:10:00:: in a letter---letter%1:10:00:: .

In Ireland---ireland%1:15:01:: 's County Limerick---location%1:03:00:: , near the River Shannon---location%1:03:00:: , there is a quiet little suburb---suburb%1:15:00:: by the name---name%1:10:00:: of Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: , which means `` Garden---garden%1:06:00:: of Owen---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Undoubtedly none of the residents---resident%1:18:00:: realize the influence---influence%1:19:00:: their town---town%1:15:00:: has had on American military history---history%1:28:00:: , or the deeds of valor---valor%1:07:00:: that have been done in its name---name%1:10:00:: .
The cry---battle_cry%1:10:00:: `` Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: '' !
bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth---earth%1:15:00:: by untold numbers of Cheyennes , Sioux and Apaches , Mexican banditos under Pancho Villa , Japanese in the South Pacific , and Chinese and North Korean Communists in Korea .
bursting from the lips---lip%1:08:00:: of a charging cavalry---cavalry%1:14:01:: trooper---trooper%1:18:01:: was the last sound---sound%1:07:00:: heard on this earth---earth%1:17:00:: by untold numbers---number%1:07:00:: of Cheyennes---cheyenne%1:10:00:: , Sioux---sioux%1:18:00:: and Apaches---apache%1:18:00:: , Mexican banditos under Pancho Villa---person%1:03:00:: , Japanese in the South Pacific---location%1:03:00:: , and Chinese and North Korean Communists---communist%1:18:01:: in Korea---korea%1:15:00:: .
Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: is the battle cry---battle_cry%1:10:00:: of the 7 th U. S. Cavalry Regiment---group%1:03:00:: , `` The Fighting Seventh---group%1:03:00:: '' .
Today---today%1:28:00:: a battle cry---battle_cry%1:10:00:: may seem an anachronism---anachronism%1:06:00:: , for in the modern Army---army%1:14:00:: , esprit de corps---esprit_de_corps%1:07:00:: has been sacrificed to organizational charts---chart%1:10:00:: and tables---table%1:14:00:: .
But do n't tell that to a veteran---veteran%1:18:01:: of the Fighting Seventh---group%1:03:00:: , especially in a saloon---saloon%1:06:00:: on Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: .
Of all the thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of men---man%1:18:03:: who have served in the 7 th Cav , perhaps no one knows its spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: better than Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C. Chandler---person%1:03:00:: .
Wiry and burr headed , with steel blue---steel_blue%1:07:00:: eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and a chest---chest%1:08:00:: splattered with medals---medal%1:10:00:: , Chandler---person%1:03:00:: is the epitome---epitome%1:09:00:: of the old-time trooper---trooper%1:18:01:: .
The truth---truth%1:09:00:: is , however , that when Mel Chandler---person%1:03:00:: first reported to the regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: the only steed---steed%1:05:00:: he had ever ridden was a swivel chair---swivel_chair%1:06:00:: and the only weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: he had ever wielded was a pencil---pencil%1:06:00:: .
Chandler---person%1:03:00:: had been commissioned in the Medical Service Corps---group%1:03:00:: and was serving as a personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: officer---officer%1:18:03:: for the Kansas City Medical Depot---group%1:03:00:: when he decided that if he was going to make the Army---army%1:14:00:: his career---career%1:04:00:: , he wanted to be in the fighting part---part%1:24:00:: of it .
Though he knew no more about military science---science%1:09:02:: and tactics---tactics%1:09:01:: than any other desk officer---desk_officer%1:18:00:: , he managed to get transferred to the combat---combat%1:04:00:: forces---force%1:14:01:: .
The next thing---thing%1:26:00:: he knew he was reporting for duty---duty%1:04:02:: as commanding officer---commanding_officer%1:18:00:: of Troop H---group%1:03:00:: , 7 th Cavalry , in the middle of corps---corps%1:14:00:: maneuvers---maneuver%1:04:02:: in Japan---japan%1:15:00:: .
Outside of combat---combat%1:04:00:: , he could n't have landed in a tougher spot---spot%1:04:01:: .
First of all , no unit---unit%1:24:00:: likes to have a new CO---commanding_officer%1:18:00:: brought in from the outside---outside%1:15:01:: , especially when he 's an armchair trooper---trooper%1:18:01:: .
Second , if there is ever a perfect time---time%1:28:06:: to pull the rug out from under him , it 's on maneuvers---maneuver%1:04:02:: .
In combat---combat%1:04:01:: , helping your CO---commanding_officer%1:18:00:: make a fool---fool%1:18:00:: of himself might mean getting yourself killed .
In combat---combat%1:04:00:: , helping your CO make a fool---fool%1:18:01:: of himself might mean getting yourself killed .
But in maneuvers---maneuver%1:04:02:: , with the top brass---brass%1:14:00:: watching him all the time , it 's easy .
Chandler---person%1:03:00:: understood this and expected the worst---worst%1:11:00:: .
But his first few days---day%1:28:00:: with Troop H---group%1:03:00:: were full of surprises---surprise%1:11:00:: , beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early---person%1:03:00:: .
Chandler---person%1:03:00:: had expected a tough old trooper---trooper%1:18:01:: with a gravel voice---voice%1:07:00:: .
Instead Sergeant Early---person%1:03:00:: was quiet , sharp and confident .
He had enlisted in the Army---army%1:14:00:: straight out of high school---high_school%1:14:00:: and had immediately set about learning his new trade---trade%1:04:00:: .
There was no weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: Early---person%1:03:00:: could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded .
He could lead a patrol---patrol%1:14:00:: and he knew his paper work---paperwork%1:04:00:: .
Further , he had taken full advantage of the Army---army%1:14:00:: 's correspondence courses---correspondence_course%1:04:00:: .
He not only knew soldiering---soldiering%1:09:00:: , but mathematics---mathematics%1:09:00:: , history---history%1:09:00:: and literature---literature%1:09:00:: as well .
But for all his erudite confidence---confidence%1:09:00:: , Sergeant Early---person%1:03:00:: was right out of the Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: mold---mold%1:06:00:: .
He was filled with the spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: of the Fighting Seventh---group%1:03:00:: .
He was filled with the spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: of the Fighting Seventh .
That saved Mel Chandler---person%1:03:00:: .
Sergeant Early let the new CO know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop---troop%1:14:00:: in the best regiment in the United States Army .
Sergeant Early---person%1:03:00:: let the new CO---commanding_officer%1:18:00:: know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop---troop%1:14:03:: in the best regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: in the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: Army---army%1:14:00:: .
He fed the captain---captain%1:18:05:: bits---bit%1:23:01:: of history---history%1:10:00:: about the troops---troops%1:14:00:: and the regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: .
For example , it was a battalion---battalion%1:14:00:: of the 7 th Cavalry---group%1:03:00:: under Colonel George Armstrong Custer---person%1:03:00:: that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn .
It did n't take Captain Chandler---person%1:03:00:: long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load---load%1:06:00:: of tradition---tradition%1:09:02:: on his shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: as commander---commander%1:18:00:: of Troop H---group%1:03:00:: .
But what made the load---load%1:06:00:: lighter was the realization---realization%1:09:00:: that every officer---officer%1:18:03:: , non-com---noncom%1:18:00:: and trooper---trooper%1:18:01:: was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good---good%1:07:00:: of the troop---troop%1:14:03:: and the regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: .
But what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer , non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it , for the good of the troop---troop%1:14:00:: and the regiment .
Maneuvers---maneuver%1:04:02:: over , the 7 th---group%1:03:00:: returned to garrison---garrison%1:06:00:: duty---duty%1:04:02:: in Tokyo---tokyo%1:15:00:: , Captain Chandler---person%1:03:00:: still with them .
It was the 7 th Cavalry---group%1:03:00:: whose troopers---trooper%1:18:01:: were charged with guarding the Imperial Palace of the Emperor---location%1:03:00:: .
But still Mel Chandler---person%1:03:00:: was not completely convinced that men---man%1:18:03:: would really die for a four syllable---syllable%1:10:00:: word---word%1:10:00:: , `` Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: '' .
The final proof---proof%1:09:00:: was a small incident---incident%1:11:00:: .
It happened at the St. Patrick 's Day party---party%1:14:00:: , a big affair---affair%1:11:00:: for a regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: which had gone into battle---battle%1:04:00:: for over three quarters---quarter%1:23:01:: of a century---century%1:28:00:: to the strains---strain%1:10:00:: of an Irish march .
In the middle of the party---party%1:14:00:: Chandler---person%1:03:00:: looked up to see four smiling faces---face%1:08:00:: bearing down upon him , each beaming above the biggest , greenest shamrock---shamrock%1:20:02:: he had ever seen .
The faces---face%1:08:00:: belonged to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding---person%1:03:00:: , his wife---wife%1:18:00:: and their two children---child%1:18:01:: .
And when the singing---singing%1:04:00:: began , it was the Gouldings---person%1:03:00:: who sang the old Irish songs---song%1:10:00:: the best .
Though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle---chuckle%1:10:00:: about Marvin Goulding---person%1:03:00:: , the Jewish officer---officer%1:18:03:: from Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: , singing tearfully about the ould sod---sod%1:17:00:: , no one really thought it was strange .
For Marvin Goulding---person%1:03:00:: , like Giovanni Martini---person%1:03:00:: , the bugler---bugler%1:18:00:: boy---boy%1:18:02:: who carried Custer---person%1:03:00:: 's last message---message%1:10:01:: , or Margarito Lopez---person%1:03:00:: , the one-man Army---army%1:14:00:: on Leyte---leyte%1:04:00:: , was a Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: , through and through .
It was no coincidence---coincidence%1:11:00:: that Goulding---person%1:03:00:: was one of the most beloved platoon---platoon%1:14:00:: leaders---leader%1:18:00:: in the regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: .
And so Mel Chandler---person%1:03:00:: got the spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: of Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: .
He set out to keep Troop H the best troop---troop%1:14:00:: in the best regiment .
He set out to keep Troop H---group%1:03:00:: the best troop---troop%1:14:03:: in the best regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: .
One of his innovations was to see to it that every man---man%1:18:00:: - cook and clerk as well as rifleman - qualified with every weapon in the troop---troop%1:14:00:: .
One of his innovations---innovation%1:06:00:: was to see to it that every man---man%1:18:03:: - cook---cook%1:18:00:: and clerk---clerk%1:18:00:: as well as rifleman---rifleman%1:18:00:: - qualified with every weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: in the troop---troop%1:14:03:: .
Even the mess---mess%1:13:00:: sergeant---sergeant%1:18:01:: , Bill Brown---person%1:03:00:: , a dapper , cocky transfer---transfer%1:18:00:: from an airborne division---division%1:14:00:: , went out on the range---range%1:06:00:: .
The troop---troop%1:14:03:: received a new leader---leader%1:18:00:: , Lieutenant Robert M. Carroll---person%1:03:00:: , fresh out of ROTC---rotc%1:14:00:: and bucking for Regular Army---regular_army%1:14:00:: status---status%1:26:00:: .
The troop---troop%1:14:00:: received a new leader , Lieutenant Robert M. Carroll , fresh out of ROTC and bucking for Regular Army status .
Carroll---person%1:03:00:: was sharp and military , but he was up against tough competition---competition%1:04:00:: for that RA---group%1:03:00:: berth---berth%1:04:00:: , and he wanted to play it cool .
So Mel Chandler---person%1:03:00:: set out to sell him on the spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: of Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: , just as he himself had been sold a short time---time%1:28:00:: before .
When the Korean war---korean_war%1:04:00:: began , on June---june%1:28:00:: 25 , 1950 , the anniversary---anniversary%1:28:00:: of the day---day%1:28:01:: Custer---person%1:03:00:: had gone down fighting at the Little Big Horn---location%1:03:00:: and the day---day%1:28:01:: the regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: had assaulted the beachhead---beachhead%1:15:00:: of Leyte---leyte%1:04:00:: during World War 2 , , the 7 th Cavalry---group%1:03:00:: was not in the best fighting condition---condition%1:26:00:: .
Its entire complement---complement%1:23:00:: of non-commissioned officers---officer%1:18:03:: on the platoon---platoon%1:14:00:: level---level%1:26:01:: had departed as cadre---cadre%1:14:00:: for another unit---unit%1:24:00:: , and its vehicles---vehicle%1:06:00:: were still those used in the drive---drive%1:04:02:: across Luzon---location%1:03:00:: in World War 2 , .
Just a month---month%1:28:01:: after the Korean War---korean_war%1:04:00:: broke out , the 7 th Cavalry---group%1:03:00:: was moving into the lines---line%1:14:03:: , ready for combat---combat%1:04:00:: .
From then on the Fighting Seventh---group%1:03:00:: was in the thick---thick%1:15:00:: of the bitterest fighting---fighting%1:04:00:: in Korea---korea%1:15:00:: .
One night---night%1:28:00:: on the Naktong River---location%1:03:00:: , Mel Chandler---person%1:03:00:: called on that fabled esprit de corps---esprit_de_corps%1:07:00:: .
The regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: was dug in on the east side---east_side%1:15:00:: of the river---river%1:17:00:: and the North Koreans---north_korean%1:18:00:: were steadily building up a concentration---concentration%1:04:02:: of crack troops---troop%1:14:00:: on the other side---side%1:15:02:: .
The troopers---trooper%1:18:01:: knew an attack---attack%1:04:00:: was coming , but they did n't know when , and they did n't know where .
At 6 o ' clock on the morning---morning%1:28:00:: of August---august%1:28:00:: 12 , they were in doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: no longer .
Then it came , against Troop H---group%1:03:00:: .
The enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: had filtered across the river---river%1:17:00:: during the night---night%1:28:00:: and a full force---force%1:14:01:: of 1000 men---man%1:18:03:: , armed with Russian machine guns---machine_gun%1:06:00:: , attacked the position---position%1:15:02:: held by Chandler---person%1:03:00:: 's men---man%1:18:03:: .
They came in waves---wave%1:04:02:: .
First came the cannon fodder---cannon_fodder%1:18:00:: , white clad civilians---civilian%1:18:00:: being driven into death---death%1:19:00:: as a massive human battering ram---battering_ram%1:06:00:: .
First came the cannon fodder , white clad civilians being driven into death---death%1:28:00:: as a massive human battering ram .
They were followed by crack North Korean troops---troop%1:14:00:: , who mounted one charge---charge%1:04:01:: after another .
They overran the 7 th Cav---group%1:03:00:: 's forward machine-gun---machine_gun%1:06:00:: positions---position%1:15:02:: through sheer weight---weight%1:07:00:: of numbers---number%1:07:00:: , over piles---pile%1:14:00:: of their own dead---dead%1:14:00:: .
Another force---force%1:14:01:: flanked the company---company%1:14:03:: and took up a position---position%1:15:02:: on a hill---hill%1:17:00:: to the rear---rear%1:14:00:: .
Captain Chandler---person%1:03:00:: saw that it was building up strength---strength%1:07:05:: .
He assembled a group---group%1:03:00:: of 25 men---man%1:18:03:: , composed of wounded troopers---trooper%1:18:01:: awaiting evacuation---evacuation%1:04:01:: , the company---company%1:14:03:: clerk---clerk%1:18:00:: , supply---supply%1:04:00:: men---man%1:18:03:: , cooks---cook%1:18:00:: and drivers---driver%1:18:00:: , and led them to the hill---hill%1:17:00:: .
One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll---person%1:03:00:: , the young officer---officer%1:18:03:: bucking for the Regular Army---regular_army%1:14:00:: .
Chandler---person%1:03:00:: left Carroll---person%1:03:00:: at the bottom---bottom%1:15:01:: of the hill---hill%1:17:00:: to direct any reinforcements---reinforcement%1:04:01:: he could find to the fight---fight%1:04:01:: .
Then Mel Chandler---person%1:03:00:: started up the hill---hill%1:17:00:: .
He took one step---step%1:04:00:: , two , broke into a trot---trot%1:04:00:: and then into a run---run%1:04:00:: .
The first thing---thing%1:11:00:: he knew the words---word%1:10:00:: `` Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: '' ! burst from his throat---throat%1:08:00:: .
His followers---follower%1:18:00:: shouted the old battle cry---battle_cry%1:10:00:: after him and charged the hill---hill%1:17:00:: , firing as they ran .
The Koreans---korean%1:18:00:: fell back , but regrouped at the top---top%1:15:02:: of the hill---hill%1:17:00:: and pinned down the cavalrymen---cavalryman%1:18:01:: with a screen---screen%1:06:04:: of fire---fire%1:04:00:: .
Chandler---person%1:03:00:: , looking to right---right%1:15:00:: and left---left%1:15:00:: to see how his men---man%1:18:03:: were faring , suddenly saw another figure---figure%1:08:00:: bounding up the hill---hill%1:17:00:: , hurling grenades---grenade%1:06:00:: and hollering the battle cry---battle_cry%1:10:00:: as he ran .
It was Bob Carroll---person%1:03:00:: , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: of Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: .
It was Bob Carroll , who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: of Garryowen .
He had formed his own task force---task_force%1:14:00:: of three stragglers---straggler%1:18:00:: and led them up the hill---hill%1:17:00:: in a Fighting Seventh---person%1:03:00:: charge---charge%1:04:01:: .
Because of this diversionary attack---diversionary_attack%1:04:00:: the main group---group%1:03:00:: that had been pinned down on the hill---hill%1:17:00:: was able to surge forward again .
But an enemy grenade---grenade%1:06:00:: hit Carroll---person%1:03:00:: in the head---head%1:08:00:: and detonated simultaneously .
He went down like a wet rag---rag%1:06:00:: and the attackers---attacker%1:18:00:: hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire---fire%1:04:00:: .
Enemy reinforcements---reinforcement%1:04:01:: came pouring down , seeking a soft spot---soft_spot%1:07:00:: .
They found it at the junction---junction%1:06:00:: between Troops H and G---group%1:03:00:: , and prepared to counterattack .
Marvin Goulding---person%1:03:00:: saw what was happening .
He turned to his platoon---platoon%1:14:00:: .
`` Okay , men---man%1:18:03:: '' , he said .
Goulding---person%1:03:00:: leaped to his feet---foot%1:08:01:: and started forward , `` Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: '' ! on his lips---lip%1:08:00:: , his men---man%1:18:03:: following .
But the bullets---bullet%1:06:00:: whacked home before he finished his battle cry---battle_cry%1:10:00:: and Marvin Goulding---person%1:03:00:: fell dead .
For an instant---instant%1:28:01:: his men---man%1:18:03:: hesitated , unable to believe that their lieutenant---lieutenant%1:18:01:: , the most popular officer---officer%1:18:03:: in the regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: , was dead .
Then they let out a bellow---bellow%1:10:00:: of anguish---anguish%1:26:00:: and rage---rage%1:26:00:: and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: '' ! they charged into the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: like wild men---wild_man%1:18:00:: .
Then they let out a bellow of anguish---anguish%1:12:02:: and rage---rage%1:12:00:: and , cursing , screaming and hollering `` Garryowen '' ! they charged into the enemy like wild men .
That finished the job---job%1:04:01:: that Captain Chandler---person%1:03:00:: and Lieutenant Carroll---person%1:03:00:: had begun .
Goulding---person%1:03:00:: 's platoon---platoon%1:14:00:: pushed back the enemy soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: and broke up the timing---timing%1:07:00:: of the entire enemy attack---attack%1:04:00:: .
Reinforcements---reinforcement%1:04:01:: came up quickly to take advantage of the opening---opening%1:17:00:: made by Goulding---person%1:03:00:: 's platoon---platoon%1:14:00:: .
The North Koreans---north_korean%1:18:00:: threw away their guns---gun%1:06:00:: and fled across the rice paddies---rice_paddy%1:15:00:: .
Artillery---artillery%1:14:00:: and air strikes---strike%1:04:02:: were called in to kill them by the hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: .
Though Bob Carroll---person%1:03:00:: seemed to have had his head---head%1:08:00:: practically blown off by the exploding grenade---grenade%1:06:00:: , he lived .
Today---today%1:28:00:: he is a major---major%1:18:00:: - in the Regular Army---regular_army%1:14:00:: .
So filled was Mel Chandler---person%1:03:00:: with the spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: of Garryowen---location%1:03:00:: that after Korea---korea%1:15:00:: was over , he took on the job---job%1:04:01:: of writing the complete history---history%1:10:00:: of the regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: .
After years---year%1:28:01:: of digging , nights---night%1:28:00:: and weekends---weekend%1:28:00:: , he put together the big , profusely illustrated book---book%1:10:00:: , Of Garryowen and Glory , which is probably the most complete history---history%1:10:00:: of any military unit---military_unit%1:14:00:: .
The battle---battle%1:04:00:: of the Naktong River---location%1:03:00:: is just one example---example%1:09:00:: of how the battle cry---battle_cry%1:10:00:: and the spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: of The Fighting Seventh---group%1:03:00:: have paid off .
For nearly a century---century%1:28:00:: the cry---battle_cry%1:10:00:: has never failed to rally the fighting men---man%1:18:03:: of the regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: .
Take the case---case%1:11:00:: of Major Marcus A. Reno---person%1:03:00:: , who survived the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876 .
From the enlisted men---enlisted_man%1:18:00:: he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer---officer%1:18:03:: whose wife---wife%1:18:00:: he tried to rape , a lot---lot%1:23:00:: of men---man%1:18:03:: had plenty---plenty%1:07:00:: of reason---reason%1:16:00:: heartily to dislike Marcus Reno---person%1:03:00:: .
Many of his fellow officers---officer%1:18:03:: refused to speak to him .
But when a board---board%1:14:00:: of inquiry---inquiry%1:04:00:: was called to look into the charges---charge%1:10:00:: of cowardice---cowardice%1:07:00:: made against him , the men---man%1:18:03:: who had seen Reno---person%1:03:00:: leave the battlefield---battlefield%1:15:00:: and the officer---officer%1:18:03:: who had heard Reno---person%1:03:00:: suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux---sioux%1:18:00:: , refused to say a harsh word---word%1:10:00:: against him .
He was a member---member%1:18:00:: of The Fighting Seventh---group%1:03:00:: .
Although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn , about which more words---word%1:10:00:: have been written than any other battle---battle%1:04:00:: in American history---history%1:28:00:: , that the 7 th Cavalry---group%1:03:00:: first made its mark---mark%1:07:02:: in history---history%1:28:02:: , the regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: was ten years---year%1:28:01:: old by then---then%1:28:00:: .
Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer---person%1:03:00:: was the regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: 's first permanent commander---commander%1:18:00:: and , like such generals---general%1:18:00:: as George S. Patton---person%1:03:00:: and Terry de la Mesa Allen---person%1:03:00:: in their rise---rise%1:11:02:: to military prominence---prominence%1:26:00:: , Custer---person%1:03:00:: was a believer---believer%1:18:01:: in blood and guts warfare---warfare%1:04:00:: .
During the Civil War---civil_war%1:04:00:: , Custer---person%1:03:00:: , who achieved a brilliant record---record%1:04:01:: , was made brigadier general---brigadier_general%1:18:00:: at the age---age%1:07:00:: of 23 .
He finished the war---war%1:04:00:: as a major general---major-general%1:18:00:: , commanding a full division---division%1:14:00:: , and at 25 was the youngest major general---major-general%1:18:00:: in the history---history%1:28:00:: of the U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: Army---army%1:14:00:: .
Among us , we three---three%1:23:00:: handled quite a few small commissions---commission%1:04:02:: , from spot---spot%1:10:01:: drawings---drawing%1:10:00:: for advertising agencies---advertising_agency%1:14:00:: uptown---uptown%1:15:00:: to magazine---magazine%1:10:00:: work---work%1:06:00:: and quick lettering---lettering%1:10:00:: jobs---job%1:04:00:: .
Each of us had his own specialty---specialty%1:07:02:: besides .
George---person%1:03:00:: did wonderful complicated pen-and-ink---pen-and-ink%1:06:00:: drawings---drawing%1:06:00:: like something out of a medieval miniature---miniature%1:06:02:: : hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of delicate details---detail%1:24:00:: crammed into an eight by ten sheet---sheet%1:10:00:: and looking as if they had been done under a jeweler's glass---jeweler's_glass%1:06:00:: .
He also drew precise crisp spots---spot%1:10:01:: , which he sold to various literary and artistic journals---journal%1:10:00:: , The New Yorker , for instance , or Esquire .
I did book jackets---book_jacket%1:10:00:: and covers---cover%1:06:04:: for paperback---paperback%1:06:00:: reprints---reprint%1:10:01:: : naked girls---girl%1:18:00:: huddling in corners---corner%1:06:02:: of dingy furnished rooms---rooms%1:06:00:: while at the doorway---doorway%1:06:00:: , daring the cops---cop%1:18:00:: to take him , is the guy---guy%1:18:00:: in shirt sleeves---shirtsleeves%1:26:00:: clutching a revolver---revolver%1:06:00:: .
The book---book%1:10:00:: could be The Brothers Karamazov , but it would still have the same jacket---jacket%1:06:01:: illustration---illustration%1:10:00:: .
I remember once I did a jacket---jacket%1:06:01:: for Magpie Press---group%1:03:00:: ; the book---book%1:10:00:: was a fine historical novel---novel%1:10:00:: about Edward 3---person%1:03:00:: , , and I did a week---week%1:28:00:: of research---research%1:04:00:: to get the details---detail%1:24:00:: just right : the fifteenth century---century%1:28:00:: armor---armor%1:06:00:: , furnishings , clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: .
I even ferreted out the materials---material%1:27:00:: from which shields---shield%1:06:01:: were made - linden---linden%1:20:02:: wood---wood%1:27:00:: covered with leather---leather%1:27:00:: - so I 'd get the light---light%1:19:00:: reflections---reflection%1:19:00:: accurate .
McKenzie---person%1:03:00:: , the art editor---art_editor%1:18:00:: , took one look at my finished sketch---sketch%1:06:00:: and said , `` Nothing doing , Rufus---person%1:03:00:: .
In the first place---place%1:10:02:: , it 's static ; in the second place---place%1:09:00:: , it does n't look---look%1:07:01:: authentic ; and in the third place---place%1:09:00:: , it would cost a fortune---fortune%1:21:00:: to reproduce in the first place - you 've got six colors---color%1:07:00:: there including gold---gold%1:07:00:: '' .
I said , `` Mr. McKenzie---person%1:03:00:: , it is as authentic as careful research---research%1:04:00:: can make it '' .
He said , `` That may be , but it is n't authentic the way---way%1:07:01:: readers---reader%1:18:02:: think .
They know from their researches---research%1:04:00:: into television---television%1:10:00:: and the movies---movie%1:10:00:: that knights---knight%1:18:00:: in the middle ages---middle_ages%1:28:00:: had beautiful flowing haircuts---haircut%1:08:00:: like Little Lord Fauntleroy---person%1:03:00:: , and only the villains---villain%1:18:01:: had beards---beard%1:08:00:: .
And girls---girl%1:18:00:: could n't have dressed like that - it is n't transparent enough '' .
In the end , I did the same old picture---picture%1:06:01:: , the naked girl---girl%1:18:00:: and the guy---guy%1:18:00:: in the doorway---doorway%1:06:00:: , only I put a Lord Byron---person%1:03:00:: shirt---shirt%1:06:00:: on the guy---guy%1:18:00:: , gave him a sword---sword%1:06:00:: instead of a pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: , and painted in furniture---furniture%1:06:00:: from the stills---still%1:06:01:: of a costume movie---movie%1:10:00:: .
McKenzie---person%1:03:00:: was as happy as a clam .
`` That 's authenticity---authenticity%1:07:00:: '' , he said .
As for Donald---person%1:03:00:: , he actually sold paintings---painting%1:06:00:: .
We all painted in our spare time---spare_time%1:28:00:: , and we had all started as easel---easel%1:06:00:: painters---painter%1:18:00:: with scholarships---scholarship%1:21:00:: , but he was the only one of us who made any regular money---money%1:21:00:: at it .
Not much ; he sold perhaps three---three%1:23:00:: or four---four%1:23:00:: a year---year%1:28:01:: , and usually all to Joyce Monmouth---person%1:03:00:: or her friends---friend%1:18:00:: .
He had style---style%1:07:00:: , a real inner vision---vision%1:09:04:: of his very own .
It was strange stuff---stuff%1:06:00:: - it reminded me of the pictures---picture%1:06:01:: of a child---child%1:18:00:: , but a child---child%1:18:00:: who has never played with other kids---kid%1:18:00:: and has lived all its life---life%1:28:01:: with adults---adult%1:18:00:: .
There was the freshness---freshness%1:07:00:: of color---color%1:07:00:: , the freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: of perception---perception%1:09:02:: , the lack---lack%1:26:00:: of self-consciousness---self-consciousness%1:12:00:: , but with a twist---twist%1:04:01:: that made the forms---form%1:03:00:: leap from the page---page%1:10:00:: and smack you in the eye---eye%1:08:00:: .
We used to kid him by saying he only painted that way---way%1:07:01:: because he was so nearsighted .
It may have been true for all I know , because his glasses---glasses%1:06:00:: were like the bottoms---bottom%1:15:00:: of milk---milk%1:13:01:: bottles---bottle%1:06:00:: , but it did n't prevent the paintings---painting%1:06:00:: from being exciting .
He also had , at times , an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker---sleepwalker%1:18:00:: ; he would look right through you while you were talking to him , and if you said , `` For Christ's sake , Donald---person%1:03:00:: , you 've got Prussian blue---prussian_blue%1:27:00:: all over your shirt---shirt%1:06:00:: '' , he would smile , and nod , and an hour---hour%1:28:00:: later the paint---paint%1:06:00:: would be all over his pants as well .
Mrs. Monmouth---person%1:03:00:: thought of him as her discovery---discovery%1:10:00:: , and she paid two to three hundred dollars---dollar%1:21:00:: for a painting---painting%1:06:00:: .
It was all gravy , and Donald---person%1:03:00:: did n't need much---much%1:23:00:: to live on ; none of us did .
We shared the expenses---expense%1:21:00:: of the studio---studio%1:06:00:: , and we all lived within walking distance---distance%1:07:00:: of it , in cheap lodgings---lodgings%1:06:00:: of one kind---kind%1:09:00:: or another .
Attending the life class---life_class%1:04:00:: was my idea---idea%1:09:00:: - or rather , Askington---person%1:03:00:: 's idea---idea%1:09:00:: , but I was ripe for it , and the other two would n't have gone if I had n't talked them into it .
I had n't done a serious picture---picture%1:06:01:: in almost a year---year%1:28:01:: .
It was n't just the pressure---pressure%1:26:00:: of work---work%1:04:01:: , although that was the excuse---excuse%1:10:00:: I often used , even to myself .
It was the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of work---work%1:04:01:: I was doing , the quality---quality%1:07:00:: of the ambition---ambition%1:12:00:: it awoke in me , that kept me from painting---painting%1:04:00:: .
I kept saying , `` If I could just build up a reputation---reputation%1:26:00:: for myself , make some real money---money%1:21:02:: , get to be well known as an illustrator---illustrator%1:18:00:: - like Peter Askington---person%1:03:00:: , for instance - then I could take some time off---time_off%1:28:00:: and paint '' .
Askington---person%1:03:00:: was a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of goal---goal%1:09:00:: I set myself ; I had admired him long before I talked to him .
It looked to me as though he had everything an artist---artist%1:18:00:: could want , joy---joy%1:09:00:: in his work---work%1:04:01:: , standing---standing%1:26:00:: in the profession---profession%1:14:00:: , a large and steady income---income%1:21:00:: .
The night---night%1:28:00:: we first met , at one of Mrs. Monmouth---person%1:03:00:: 's giant parties---party%1:11:00:: , he was wearing a brown cashmere---cashmere%1:06:00:: jacket---jacket%1:06:00:: with silver buttons---button%1:06:00:: and a soft pink Viyella---viyella%1:06:00:: shirt---shirt%1:06:00:: ; instead of a necktie---necktie%1:06:00:: he wore a leather---leather%1:27:00:: bolo---bolo%1:06:01:: drawn through a golden ring---ring%1:06:02:: in which was set a lump---lump%1:17:00:: of pale pure jade---jade%1:27:00:: .
This set his tone---tone%1:26:01:: : richness---richness%1:07:03:: of texture---texture%1:07:00:: and color---color%1:07:00:: , and another kind---kind%1:09:00:: of richness---richness%1:26:00:: as well , for his clothing---clothing%1:06:00:: and decorations---decoration%1:06:00:: would have paid the Brush-off 's rent---rent%1:21:00:: for a year---year%1:28:01:: .
He was fifteen years---year%1:28:01:: older than I - forty four - but full of spring---spring%1:07:00:: and sparkle---sparkle%1:07:01:: .
He did n't look like what I thought of as an old man---old_man%1:18:02:: , and his lively and erudite speech---speech%1:10:00:: made him seem even younger .
He was one of the most prominent magazine---magazine%1:10:00:: illustrators---illustrator%1:18:00:: in America---america%1:15:00:: ; you saw one of his paintings---painting%1:06:00:: on the cover---cover%1:06:04:: of one or another of the slick national magazines---magazine%1:10:00:: every month .
Life---group%1:03:00:: had included him in its `` Modern---modern%1:18:00:: American---american%1:18:00:: Artists---artist%1:18:00:: '' series---series%1:10:00:: and had photographed him at his studio---studio%1:06:00:: in the East Sixties ; the corner---corner%1:06:02:: of it you could see in the photograph---photograph%1:06:00:: looked as though it ought to have Velasquez---person%1:03:00:: in it painting the royalty---royalty%1:14:00:: of Spain---spain%1:15:00:: .
We went into Mrs. Monmouth---person%1:03:00:: 's library---library%1:06:01:: , which had low bookshelves---bookshelf%1:06:00:: all along the walls---wall%1:06:00:: , and above them a Modigliani---person%1:03:00:: portrait , a Jackson Pollock---person%1:03:00:: twelve feet---foot%1:23:00:: long , and a gorgeous Miro---person%1:03:00:: with a yellow background---background%1:09:00:: , that looked like an inscription---inscription%1:10:00:: from a Martian tomb---tomb%1:06:00:: .
The fireplace---fireplace%1:06:01:: had tiles---tile%1:06:00:: made for Mrs. Monmouth---person%1:03:00:: by Picasso---picasso%1:18:00:: himself .
Like certain expensive restaurants---restaurant%1:06:00:: , just sitting there gave you the illusion---illusion%1:09:00:: of being wealthy yourself .
In the course---course%1:15:00:: of our talk---talk%1:10:00:: , Askington---person%1:03:00:: mentioned that he spent part---part%1:24:00:: of each week studying .
`` No , I take classes---class%1:04:00:: with different people---people%1:14:00:: '' , he said .
`` I do n't think I 've reached the point---point%1:26:00:: , yet , where I can say I know everything I ought to know about the craft---craft%1:04:00:: .
Besides , it 's important to the way---way%1:07:01:: a painter---painter%1:18:00:: thinks that he should move in a certain atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: , an atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: in which he may absorb the ideas---idea%1:09:00:: of other masters---master%1:18:00:: , as Durer---person%1:03:00:: went to Italy---italy%1:15:00:: to meet Bellini---person%1:03:00:: and Mantegna---person%1:03:00:: '' .
He made a circle---circle%1:25:00:: with his thumb---thumb%1:08:00:: and fingers---finger%1:08:00:: .
`` Painting---painting%1:04:00:: is n't this big , you know .
It does n't embrace only the artist---artist%1:18:00:: , alone before his easel---easel%1:06:00:: .
It is as large as all of art---art%1:06:00:: , interdependent , varied , multitudinous '' .
He threw his arms---arm%1:08:00:: wide , his face---face%1:07:00:: shining .
`` The artist---artist%1:18:00:: is like a fragment---fragment%1:17:01:: of a mosaic---mosaic%1:06:00:: - no , he is more than that , a virtuoso performer---performer%1:18:00:: in some vast philharmonic .
One of these days , I 'm going to organize a gigantic exhibition---exhibition%1:14:00:: that will span everything that 's being painted these days---day%1:28:05:: , from extreme abstract expressionism---abstract_expressionism%1:06:00:: to extreme photorealism , and then you 'll be able to see at a glance---glance%1:04:00:: how much---much%1:23:00:: artists---artist%1:18:00:: have in common with each other .
The eye---eye%1:09:00:: is all , inward or outward .
Ah , what a title---title%1:10:00:: for the exhibition---exhibition%1:14:00:: : The Eye---eye%1:09:00:: is All '' !
`` I 'm studying anatomy---anatomy%1:09:00:: with Burns---person%1:03:00:: '' , he replied .
He teaches at the Manhattan School of Art---group%1:03:00:: '' .
I had studied with Burns---person%1:03:00:: ten years---year%1:28:01:: before , during the scholarship---scholarship%1:21:00:: year---year%1:28:01:: the Manhattan---location%1:03:00:: gave me , along with the five-hundred dollar---dollar%1:21:00:: prize---prize%1:21:00:: for my paintings---painting%1:06:00:: of bums---bum%1:18:01:: on Hudson Street---location%1:03:00:: .
Burns---person%1:03:00:: and I had not loved each other .
`` I 'm also studying enameling with Hajime Iijima---person%1:03:00:: '' , he went on , `` and twice a week---week%1:28:00:: I go to a life class---life_class%1:04:00:: taught by Pendleton---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` Osric Pendleton---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
He must be a million years---years%1:28:00:: old .
I went to a retrospective---retrospective%1:14:00:: of his work---work%1:06:00:: when I was eighteen , and I thought he was a contemporary---contemporary%1:18:00:: of Cezanne---person%1:03:00:: 's '' .
Askington---person%1:03:00:: laughed .
Still painting , still a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of modern impressionist---impressionist%1:18:00:: , beautiful canvases---canvas%1:06:04:: of mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: and farms---farm%1:06:00:: .
He even makes the city---city%1:15:00:: look like one of Thoreau---thoreau%1:18:00:: 's hangouts---hangout%1:15:00:: .
I 've always admired him , and when I heard he was taking a few pupils---pupil%1:18:00:: , I went to him and joined his class---class%1:14:03:: '' .
`` Yes , it sounds great '' , I said , `` but suppose you do n't think of yourself as an impressionist painter---painter%1:18:00:: '' ?
`` You 're missing the point---point%1:10:01:: '' , he said .
`` He has the magical eye---eye%1:09:00:: .
And he is a great man---man%1:18:00:: .
Contact---contact%1:04:02:: with him is stimulating .
And that 's the trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: with so many artists---artist%1:18:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: .
They lack stimulation---stimulation%1:09:00:: .
They sit alone in their rooms---room%1:06:00:: and try to paint , and only succeed in isolating themselves still farther from life---life%1:09:00:: .
That 's one of the reasons---reason%1:10:01:: art---art%1:04:00:: is becoming a useless occupation---occupation%1:04:00:: .
In the Middle Ages---middle_ages%1:28:00:: , in the Renaissance---renaissance%1:28:00:: , right up to the early nineteenth century---century%1:28:00:: , the painter---painter%1:18:00:: was a giant---giant%1:18:01:: in the world---world%1:14:02:: .
He was an artisan---artisan%1:18:00:: , a man---man%1:18:00:: who studied his trade---trade%1:04:00:: and developed his craftsmanship---craftsmanship%1:09:00:: the way---way%1:07:01:: a goldsmith---goldsmith%1:18:00:: or a wood carver---woodcarver%1:18:00:: did .
He filled a real need---need%1:26:00:: , showing society---society%1:14:00:: what it looked like , turning it inside out , portraying its wars---war%1:04:00:: and its leaders---leaders%1:14:00:: , its ugliness---ugliness%1:07:00:: and its beauties---beauty%1:07:00:: , reflecting its profound religious impulses---impulse%1:16:00:: .
He was a propagandist---propagandist%1:18:00:: - they were n't afraid of the word---word%1:10:00:: , then - satirist---satirist%1:18:00:: , nature lover---lover%1:18:01:: , philosopher---philosopher%1:18:00:: , scientist---scientist%1:18:00:: , what you will , a member---member%1:18:00:: of every party---party%1:14:02:: and of no party---party%1:14:02:: .
But look at us today---today%1:28:00:: !
We hold safe little jobs---job%1:04:00:: illustrating tooth-paste---toothpaste%1:06:00:: ads---ad%1:10:00:: or the salacious incidents---incident%1:11:00:: in trivial novels---novel%1:10:00:: , and most of our easel---easel%1:06:00:: painting---painting%1:04:00:: is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but picking the fluff---fluff%1:27:00:: out of the navel---navel%1:08:00:: so it can be contemplated in greater purity---purity%1:26:00:: .
A bunch---bunch%1:14:01:: of amateur dervishes---dervish%1:18:00:: !
What we need is to get back to the group---group%1:03:00:: , to learning---learning%1:09:00:: and apprenticeship---apprenticeship%1:04:00:: , to the cafe---cafe%1:06:00:: and the school---school%1:06:00:: '' .
The upshot---upshot%1:19:00:: of the evening---evening%1:28:00:: was that I got the address---address%1:15:00:: of Pendleton---person%1:03:00:: 's studio---studio%1:06:00:: - or rather , of the studio---studio%1:06:00:: in which he gave his classes---class%1:04:00:: , for he did n't work there himself - and joined the life class---life_class%1:04:00:: , which met every Tuesday---tuesday%1:28:00:: and Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: from ten to twelve in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
It was an awkward hour---hour%1:28:01:: , but I did n't have to punch any time clock---time_clock%1:06:00:: , and it only meant that sometimes I had to stay a couple of hours---hour%1:28:00:: later at the drawing board---drawing_board%1:06:00:: to finish up a job---job%1:06:01:: .
After a short time---time%1:28:00:: , both George---person%1:03:00:: and Donald---person%1:03:00:: joined the class---class%1:14:03:: with me so they would n't feel lonely , and we used to hang a sign---sign%1:10:00:: on the door---door%1:06:00:: of the Brush-off reading `` out to work---work%1:04:00:: '' .
It was mostly for the benefit---benefit%1:07:00:: of the mailman---mailman%1:18:00:: , because hardly anybody else ever visited us .
In a way , Askington---person%1:03:00:: was right .
`` Stimulating '' was the word---word%1:10:03:: for it .
Partly , it was because Pendleton---person%1:03:00:: himself was n't what I anticipated .
I had come prepared to worship at the feet---foot%1:06:00:: of this classic---classic%1:18:00:: , and he turned out to be a rather bitter old man---old_man%1:18:02:: who smelled of dead cigars---cigar%1:06:00:: .
Actually , there was a lot of force---force%1:07:00:: in him , which is why I kept on in that class---class%1:04:00:: instead of quitting after a week---week%1:28:00:: .
The long and ever increasing column---column%1:14:00:: of sportsmen---sportsman%1:18:00:: is now moving into a new era---era%1:28:00:: .
Modern times---modern_times%1:28:00:: have changed the world beyond recognition---recognition%1:09:00:: .
The early years---year%1:28:01:: of the twentieth century---century%1:28:00:: seem very far away .
But with all the changes---change%1:11:00:: in philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: , dress---dress%1:06:01:: and terrain---terrain%1:15:00:: - a few things---thing%1:26:00:: remain constant , including the devotion---devotion%1:04:01:: of Americans---american%1:18:00:: to the great field sports---field_sport%1:04:00:: , hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: and fishing---fishing%1:04:00:: .
As the generations---generation%1:14:01:: move on , clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: become more suitable for the enjoyment---enjoyment%1:04:00:: of outdoor sports---sport%1:04:00:: .
Sporting firearms---firearm%1:06:00:: change , markedly for the better .
Just as modern transportation---transportation%1:06:00:: has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon---covered_wagon%1:06:00:: , the demand---demand%1:09:00:: of today---today%1:28:00:: 's sportsmen---sportsman%1:18:00:: and women---sportswoman%1:18:00:: has necessitated changes---change%1:11:00:: in their equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: .
The American firearms---firearm%1:06:00:: and ammunition---ammunition%1:06:00:: manufacturers---manufacturer%1:14:00:: through diligent research---research%1:04:00:: and technical development---development%1:04:01:: have replaced the muzzle loader---muzzle_loader%1:06:00:: and slow firing single shot---shot%1:06:00:: arms---arm%1:06:01:: with modern fast firing autoloaders---autoloader%1:06:00:: , extremely accurate bolt---bolt%1:06:02:: , lever---lever%1:06:00:: , and slide action---slide_action%1:06:00:: firearms---firearm%1:06:00:: .
And millions of rounds---round%1:06:01:: of entirely new and modern small-arms---small-arm%1:06:00:: ammunition---ammunition%1:06:00:: , designed for today---today%1:28:00:: 's hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: and target---target%1:10:00:: shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: .
And due to modern resource---resource%1:21:00:: use---use%1:04:00:: and game---game%1:05:00:: management---management%1:04:00:: practices---practice%1:04:00:: , there is still game---game%1:05:00:: to shoot , even with the ever expanding encroachment---encroachment%1:11:00:: on land---land%1:17:00:: and water---water%1:17:00:: .
Present conservation---conservation%1:04:00:: practices---practice%1:04:00:: regard wildlife---wildlife%1:14:00:: , not as an expendable natural resource---natural_resource%1:21:00:: , but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped .
Unlimited game---game%1:05:00:: bags---bag%1:23:01:: are possible and legal in more than 40 states---state%1:15:01:: , on shooting preserves---shooting_preserve%1:15:00:: ( one of the newer phases---phase%1:28:00:: of modern game---game%1:05:00:: management---management%1:04:00:: ) for five and six months---month%1:28:01:: each year .
Close to two million game birds---game_bird%1:05:00:: were harvested on 1500 commercial and private shooting preserves---shooting_preserve%1:15:00:: , and on State Game Commission---group%1:03:00:: controlled upland game---game%1:05:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: during the 1960 - 61 season---season%1:28:02:: .
The shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: development---development%1:04:01:: program---program%1:09:00:: of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute---group%1:03:00:: has successfully published these facts---fact%1:10:01:: in all major outdoor magazines---magazine%1:10:00:: , many national weeklies---weekly%1:10:00:: and the trade papers---paper%1:14:00:: .
The most effective way---way%1:04:01:: to develop more places---place%1:15:04:: for more sportsmen---sportsman%1:18:00:: to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves---shooting_preserve%1:15:00:: .
This has been the aim---aim%1:09:00:: of the director---director%1:18:00:: of the shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: development---development%1:04:01:: program---program%1:09:00:: , the New York---new_york%1:15:01:: staff---staff%1:14:01:: of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau---group%1:03:00:: , and the SAAMI---group%1:03:00:: shooting preserve---shooting_preserve%1:15:00:: field---field%1:15:01:: consultants---consultant%1:18:00:: since the start---start%1:28:00:: of the program---program%1:09:00:: in 1954 .
This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program , the New York---new_york%1:15:00:: staff of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau , and the SAAMI shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954 .
Following the kick-off---kickoff%1:28:00:: of SAAMI---group%1:03:00:: 's shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: development---development%1:04:01:: program---program%1:09:00:: in 1954 , a most interesting meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: took place in Washington---washington%1:15:01:: , D. C.---district_of_columbia%1:15:00:: .
The group---group%1:03:00:: known as the American Association for Health , Physical Education , and Recreation---group%1:03:00:: ( a division---division%1:09:00:: of the National Education Association---group%1:03:00:: ) initiated a conference---conference%1:14:00:: which brought together representatives---representative%1:18:02:: of the National Rifle Association---group%1:03:00:: , SAAMI---group%1:03:00:: and the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers---group%1:03:00:: .
This meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: was called to determine how these groups---group%1:03:00:: might cooperate to launch what is known as the Outdoor Education Project .
The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance---cognizance%1:09:00:: of the fact---fact%1:09:01:: , so often overlooked , that athletic activities---activity%1:04:00:: stressed in most school---school%1:14:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: have little or no relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: to the physical and mental needs---need%1:03:00:: and interests---interest%1:04:01:: of later life---life%1:26:01:: .
The various team---team%1:14:00:: sports---sport%1:04:00:: assuredly have their place---place%1:09:00:: in every school---school%1:14:00:: , and they are important to proper physical development---development%1:22:01:: .
But with the exception---exception%1:09:00:: of professional athletes---athlete%1:18:00:: , few contact sports---contact_sport%1:04:00:: and physical education---physical_education%1:09:00:: activities---activity%1:04:00:: in our schools---school%1:14:00:: have any carryover---carry-over%1:09:00:: in the adult life---life%1:26:01:: of the average American man---man%1:18:00:: or woman---woman%1:18:00:: .
Following a vigorous campaign---campaign%1:04:02:: of interpretation---interpretation%1:09:01:: and leadership---leadership%1:09:00:: development---development%1:04:01:: by OEP director---director%1:18:00:: Dr. Julian Smith---person%1:03:00:: , today---today%1:28:00:: thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of secondary schools---secondary_school%1:14:00:: , colleges---college%1:14:00:: and universities---university%1:14:00:: have shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: and hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: education---education%1:04:00:: in their physical education---physical_education%1:09:00:: and recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: .
SAAMI---group%1:03:00:: 's financial support---support%1:04:04:: since 1955 has contributed to the success---success%1:26:00:: of this project---project%1:04:00:: in education---education%1:04:00:: .
Personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: assigned through the shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: development---development%1:04:01:: program---program%1:09:00:: have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops---workshop%1:04:00:: , at which hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of school---school%1:14:00:: administrators---administrator%1:18:00:: , teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: , professors---professor%1:18:00:: , and recreational leaders---leader%1:18:00:: have been introduced to Outdoor Education---education%1:04:00:: .
Considering that the current school---school%1:14:00:: age---age%1:28:00:: potential---potential%1:26:00:: is 23 million youths---youth%1:18:00:: , the project---project%1:04:00:: and its message---message%1:10:01:: on hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: and shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: education---education%1:04:00:: have many more to reach .
In 1959 SAAMI---group%1:03:00:: 's shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: development---development%1:04:01:: program---program%1:09:00:: announced a new activity---activity%1:04:00:: designed to expose thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of teen-age boys---boy%1:18:00:: and girls---girl%1:18:00:: to the healthy fun---fun%1:04:00:: enjoyed through the participation---participation%1:04:00:: in the shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: sports---sport%1:04:00:: .
This program---program%1:09:00:: is now nationally known as `` Teen Hunter---hunter%1:18:00:: Clubs---club%1:14:00:: '' .
Teen Hunter---hunter%1:18:00:: Clubs---club%1:14:00:: were initially sponsored by affiliated members---member%1:24:00:: of the Allied Merchandising Corporation---group%1:03:00:: .
The first program---program%1:09:00:: was sponsored by Abraham + Strauss---group%1:03:00:: , Hempstead---location%1:03:00:: , New York---new_york%1:15:00:: , under the direction---direction%1:10:00:: of Special Events---event%1:03:00:: director---director%1:18:00:: Jennings Dennis---person%1:03:00:: .
Other pilot programs---pilot_program%1:04:00:: were conducted by A + S---group%1:03:00:: , Babylon---location%1:03:00:: , New York---new_york%1:15:00:: ; J. L. Hudson---group%1:03:00:: , Detroit---detroit%1:15:00:: ; Joseph Horne---group%1:03:00:: , Pittsburgh---pittsburgh%1:15:00:: .
Other THC---group%1:03:00:: activities---activity%1:04:00:: followed , conducted by shopping centers---shopping_center%1:06:00:: , department stores---department_store%1:06:00:: , recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: dealers---dealer%1:18:02:: , radio---radio%1:10:00:: - TV---tv%1:10:00:: stations---station%1:06:00:: , newspapers---newspaper%1:14:00:: , and other organizations---organization%1:14:00:: interested in the need---need%1:26:00:: existing to acquaint youngsters---youngster%1:18:00:: with the proper use---use%1:04:00:: of sporting firearms---firearm%1:06:00:: and the development---development%1:04:01:: of correct attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: and appreciations---appreciation%1:09:00:: related to hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: and wise use---use%1:04:00:: of our natural resources---natural_resources%1:21:00:: .
SAAMI---group%1:03:00:: 's field---field%1:15:01:: men---men%1:14:00:: have served as consultants---consultant%1:18:00:: and / or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter---hunter%1:18:00:: Club---club%1:14:00:: activities---activity%1:04:00:: which have reached over 40000 enthusiastic young Americans---american%1:18:00:: .
Through the efforts---effort%1:04:00:: of SAAMI---group%1:03:00:: 's shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: development---development%1:04:01:: program---program%1:09:00:: these shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: activities---activity%1:04:00:: , and many others , including assists---assist%1:04:01:: in the development---development%1:04:01:: of public and privately financed shooting parks---park%1:15:00:: , trap---trap%1:06:03:: and skeet---skeet%1:04:00:: leagues---league%1:14:01:: , rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: and pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: marksmanship---marksmanship%1:09:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: have been promoted , to mention only a few .
The continuation---continuation%1:04:00:: and expansion---expansion%1:04:00:: of the shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: development---development%1:04:01:: program---program%1:09:00:: will assure to some degree---degree%1:07:00:: that national and community leaders---leaders%1:14:00:: will be made aware of the ever growing need---need%1:26:00:: for shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: facilities---facility%1:06:00:: and activities---activity%1:04:00:: for hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: and shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: in answer---answer%1:10:01:: to public demand---demand%1:10:00:: .
While individual sportsmen---sportsman%1:18:00:: are aware of this situation---situation%1:26:00:: , too many of our political , social , educational and even religious leaders---leader%1:18:00:: too often forget it .
Help---help%1:04:00:: is needed from dealers---dealer%1:18:02:: , at the grass-roots level---level%1:26:00:: .
The American gun---gun%1:06:00:: and ammunition---ammunition%1:06:00:: producers---producer%1:18:01:: sponsor a successful promotional program---program%1:09:00:: through their industry---industry%1:14:00:: trade association---association%1:14:00:: .
Since SAAMI---group%1:03:00:: 's conception---conception%1:11:00:: in 1926 , and more specifically since the adoption---adoption%1:04:00:: of the Shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: Development---development%1:04:01:: Program---program%1:09:00:: in 1954 , millions of dollars---dollar%1:21:00:: and promotional man-hours---man_hour%1:28:00:: have gone into the development---development%1:04:01:: of more places---place%1:15:04:: to shoot for more youths---youth%1:18:00:: and adults---adult%1:18:00:: .
We trust that you , as a gun---gun%1:06:00:: and ammunition---ammunition%1:06:00:: dealer---dealer%1:18:02:: , have benefited through additional sales---sale%1:04:00:: of equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: .
Are you getting top dollar---dollar%1:21:00:: from the shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: sports---sport%1:04:00:: ?
Are you looking ahead to the exploding market---market%1:14:00:: of millions of American boys---boy%1:18:00:: and girls---girl%1:18:00:: , who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: - ranging the fields---field%1:15:00:: with a fine American gun---gun%1:06:00:: and uniformly excellent ammunition---ammunition%1:06:00:: ?
Is your sporting firearms---firearm%1:06:00:: and ammunition---ammunition%1:06:00:: department---department%1:14:00:: primed for the expanding horizons---horizon%1:07:00:: ?
Would you like to organize Teen Hunters---hunter%1:18:00:: Clubs---club%1:14:00:: , shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:01:: , and have information---information%1:10:00:: on seasons---season%1:28:02:: including six months---month%1:28:01:: of hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: with unlimited game---game%1:05:00:: bags---bag%1:23:01:: on shooting preserves---shooting_preserve%1:15:00:: ?
Ask Sammy Shooter---person%1:03:00:: .
We were camping a few weeks---week%1:28:00:: ago on Cape Hatteras Campground---location%1:03:00:: in that land---land%1:15:02:: of pirates---pirate%1:18:00:: , seagulls---seagull%1:05:00:: and bluefish---bluefish%1:05:00:: on North Carolina---north_carolina%1:15:00:: 's famed Outer Banks---location%1:03:00:: .
This beach---beach%1:17:00:: campground---campground%1:15:00:: with no trees---tree%1:20:00:: or hills---hill%1:17:00:: presents a constant camping---camping%1:04:00:: show---show%1:04:00:: with all manner---manner%1:09:01:: of equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: in actual use .
With the whole camp---camp%1:09:00:: exposed to view---view%1:15:00:: we could see the variety---variety%1:14:01:: of canvas---canvas%1:06:00:: shelters---shelter%1:06:01:: in which Americans---american%1:18:00:: are camping now .
There were umbrella tents---umbrella_tent%1:06:00:: , wall tents---wall_tent%1:06:00:: , cottage tents---cottage_tent%1:06:00:: , station wagon---station_wagon%1:06:00:: tents---tent%1:06:00:: , pup tents---pup_tent%1:06:00:: , Pop tents---pop_tent%1:06:00:: , Baker tents---tent%1:06:00:: , tents---tent%1:06:00:: with exterior frames---frame%1:06:02:: , camper trailers---camper_trailer%1:06:00:: , travel trailers , and even a few surplus---surplus%1:07:00:: parachutes---parachute%1:06:00:: serving as sunshades---sunshade%1:06:00:: over entire family---family%1:14:00:: camps---camp%1:06:01:: .
Moving around camp---camp%1:06:01:: we saw all kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of camp---camp%1:06:01:: stoves---stove%1:06:01:: , lanterns---lantern%1:06:00:: , coolers---cooler%1:06:00:: , bedding---bedding%1:06:00:: , games---game%1:04:00:: , fishing tackle---fishing_tackle%1:06:00:: , windbreaks---windbreak%1:06:00:: and sunshades---sunshade%1:06:00:: .
We saw similar displays---display%1:06:00:: in the other three campgrounds---campground%1:15:00:: in this 70 mile---mile%1:23:01:: long National Seashore Recreation Area .
Dealers---dealer%1:18:02:: would do well to visit such a campground---campground%1:15:00:: often , look at the equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: and talk with the campers---camper%1:18:00:: .
Here you begin to appreciate the scope---scope%1:07:00:: of the challenges---challenge%1:26:00:: and possibilities---possibility%1:09:03:: facing the industry---industry%1:14:00:: .
Camping---camping%1:04:00:: is big and getting bigger .
Almost every official---official%1:18:01:: who reflects on it thinks this movement---movement%1:04:04:: of Americans---american%1:18:00:: to canvas---canvas%1:06:00:: dwellings---dwelling%1:06:00:: opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets---market%1:14:00:: .
You read various guesses---guess%1:10:00:: on how many Americans---american%1:18:00:: are camping .
The number---number%1:07:00:: depends on who is talking at the moment---moment%1:28:02:: .
The figures---figure%1:07:01:: range as high as 15 million families---family%1:14:00:: .
I 've heard 10 million mentioned often , but I 'm more inclined to think there may be a total---total%1:09:00:: of some five to seven million families---family%1:14:00:: camping---camping%1:04:00:: .
Seven million families---family%1:14:00:: would total 30 million Americans---american%1:18:00:: or more .
Consider the equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: needed to protect this many from the weather---weather%1:19:00:: , to make their cooking easy and their sleeping---sleeping%1:09:00:: comfortable .
Harassed state park---park%1:15:00:: officials---official%1:18:01:: often have more campers---camper%1:18:00:: than they know what to do with .
They are struggling to meet the demand---demand%1:22:00:: for camping---camping%1:04:00:: space---space%1:15:00:: , but families---family%1:14:00:: are being turned away , especially on holiday---holiday%1:28:01:: weekends---weekend%1:28:00:: .
The National Parks---national_park%1:15:00:: , always popular camping---camping%1:04:00:: places---place%1:15:04:: , are facing the same pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: .
The National Park Service---national_park_service%1:14:00:: hopes by 1966 to have 30000 campsites---campsite%1:15:00:: available for 100000 campers---camper%1:18:00:: a day---day%1:28:00:: - almost twice what there are at present .
The U. S. Forest Service---group%1:03:00:: cares for hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of campers---camper%1:18:00:: in its 149 National Forests---forest%1:17:00:: and is increasing its facilities---facility%1:06:00:: steadily .
But the campers---camper%1:18:00:: still come .
They bring their families---family%1:14:00:: and tents---tent%1:06:00:: and camp---camp%1:06:00:: kitchens---kitchen%1:06:00:: and bedding---bedding%1:06:00:: .
They bring their fishing rods---fishing_rod%1:06:00:: and binoculars---binoculars%1:06:00:: and bathing suits---bathing_suit%1:06:00:: .
They come prepared for family---family%1:14:00:: fun---fun%1:04:00:: because Americans---american%1:18:00:: in ever growing numbers---number%1:07:00:: are learning that here is the way---way%1:04:01:: to a fine economical vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: that becomes a family---family%1:14:00:: experience---experience%1:11:00:: of lasting importance---importance%1:07:00:: .
There are a half dozen reasons---reason%1:10:01:: helping to account for the migration---migration%1:04:00:: to the campgrounds---campground%1:15:00:: .
Among them , according to the U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: Department of Commerce---department_of_commerce%1:14:00:: , are : ( 1 ) shorter work weeks---workweek%1:28:00:: , ( 2 ) higher pay---pay%1:21:01:: , ( 3 ) longer paid vacations---paid_vacation%1:28:00:: , ( 4 ) better transportation---transportation%1:06:00:: , ( 5 ) earlier retirement---retirement%1:04:00:: , and ( 6 ) more education---education%1:09:00:: .
The more people---people%1:14:00:: learn about their country---country%1:15:00:: , the more they want to learn .
The more people learn about their country---country%1:14:00:: , the more they want to learn .
Camping---camping%1:04:00:: is family---family%1:14:00:: fun---fun%1:04:00:: , and it is helping more Americans---american%1:18:00:: see more of the country---country%1:15:00:: than they ever saw before .
But make no mistake---mistake%1:09:00:: about it , the first reason---reason%1:16:00:: people---people%1:14:00:: turn to camping---camping%1:04:00:: is one---one%1:23:00:: of economy---economy%1:07:00:: .
Here is the promise---promise%1:09:00:: of a vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: trip---trip%1:04:00:: they can afford .
The American Automobile Association---group%1:03:00:: , computing the cost---cost%1:21:00:: for two people---people%1:14:00:: to vacation by automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: , comes up with an average daily expenditure---expenditure%1:04:00:: figure---figure%1:21:00:: of $ 29 .
The AAA---group%1:03:00:: then splits it down this way---way%1:07:01:: : $ 10.50 for meals---meal%1:13:00:: , $ 9.50 for lodging---lodging%1:06:00:: , $ 7 for gas---gas%1:27:02:: and oil---oil%1:27:00:: , and $ 2 for tips---tip%1:21:00:: and miscellaneous .
What does the camping---camping%1:04:00:: couple---couple%1:14:00:: do to this set---set%1:14:02:: of figures---figure%1:21:00:: ?
The $ 9.50 for lodging---lodging%1:06:00:: they save .
Because they prepare their own meals---meal%1:13:00:: they also keep in their pockets---pocket%1:21:00:: a good portion---portion%1:24:00:: of that $ 10.50 food---food%1:03:00:: bill---bill%1:10:01:: along with most of the tip---tip%1:21:00:: money---money%1:21:00:: .
The automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: expenses---expense%1:21:00:: are about the only vacationing---vacationing%1:04:00:: cost---cost%1:21:00:: they can n't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way---way%1:04:02:: .
Where Americans---american%1:18:00:: used to think of a single vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: each summer---summer%1:28:00:: , they now think about how many vacations---vacation%1:28:00:: they can have .
Long weekends---weekend%1:28:00:: enable many to get away from home for three or four days---day%1:28:00:: several times---time%1:11:00:: a year---year%1:28:01:: .
And even if they stay in resorts---resort%1:15:00:: part---part%1:24:00:: of the time---time%1:11:00:: , they might , if the right salesman---salesman%1:18:00:: gets them in tow---tow%1:04:00:: , develop a yearning---yearning%1:12:00:: to spice the usual vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: fare---fare%1:09:00:: with a camping---camping%1:04:00:: trip---trip%1:04:00:: into the wide open spaces---space%1:25:00:: .
It would be a mistake---mistake%1:04:00:: to sell those thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of beginning campers---camper%1:18:00:: on the idea---idea%1:09:00:: they 're buying the comforts---comforts%1:21:00:: of home---home%1:15:04:: .
Home---home%1:15:04:: is the place---place%1:15:04:: to find the comforts---comforts%1:21:00:: of home---home%1:15:04:: .
They 're buying fun---fun%1:04:00:: and adventure---adventure%1:04:00:: and family---family%1:14:00:: experiences---experience%1:11:00:: .
But it would also be a mistake---mistake%1:04:00:: for them not to realize how comfortable camping---camping%1:04:00:: has become .
This is no longer a way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: for the bearded logger---logger%1:18:00:: and the wandering cowboy---cowboy%1:18:00:: .
Today---today%1:28:00:: 's campers---camper%1:18:00:: want comforts---comforts%1:21:00:: , and they have them .
And this helps explain why so many people---people%1:14:00:: are now going camping .
It 's fun , and it 's easy - so easy that there is time---time%1:28:05:: left after cooking---cooking%1:04:00:: , and tent---tent%1:06:00:: keeping , for the women---woman%1:18:00:: to get out and enjoy outdoor fun---fun%1:04:00:: with their families---family%1:14:00:: .
Camp---camp%1:06:01:: meals---meal%1:13:00:: are no great problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
Neither are beds---bed%1:06:00:: , thanks---thanks%1:04:00:: to air mattresses---air_mattress%1:06:00:: and sleeping bags---sleeping_bag%1:06:00:: .
Neither are shelters---shelter%1:06:00:: , because there is one---one%1:23:00:: to meet the needs---need%1:26:00:: of every camper---camper%1:18:00:: or prospective camper---camper%1:18:00:: .
Neither are shelters---shelter%1:06:01:: , because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper .
But there is still the sometimes complex problem---problem%1:26:00:: of helping campers---camper%1:18:00:: choose the best equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: for their individual needs---need%1:26:00:: .
Roy Mason---person%1:03:00:: is essentially a landscape---landscape%1:06:00:: painter---painter%1:18:00:: whose style---style%1:07:00:: and direction---direction%1:09:00:: has a kinship---kinship%1:24:02:: with the English watercolorists---watercolorist%1:18:00:: of the early nineteenth century---century%1:28:00:: , especially the beautifully patterned art---art%1:06:00:: of John Sell Cotman---person%1:03:00:: .
And like this English master---master%1:18:00:: , Mason---person%1:03:00:: realizes his subjects---subject%1:06:00:: in large , simplified masses---mass%1:14:02:: which , though they seem effortless , are in reality the result---result%1:19:00:: of skilled design---design%1:04:00:: born of hard work---work%1:04:00:: and a thorough distillation---distillation%1:22:00:: of the natural form---form%1:09:00:: that inspired them .
As a boy---boy%1:18:00:: Roy Mason---person%1:03:00:: began the long process of extracting the goodness---goodness%1:07:02:: of the out-of-doors---out-of-doors%1:15:00:: , its tang---tang%1:07:00:: of weather---weather%1:19:00:: , its change---change%1:11:00:: of seasons---season%1:28:00:: , its variable moods---mood%1:26:00:: .
His father---father%1:18:00:: , a professional engraver---engraver%1:18:01:: and an amateur---amateur%1:18:00:: landscape---landscape%1:06:00:: painter---painter%1:18:00:: , took his sons---son%1:18:00:: on numerous hunting expeditions---hunting_expedition%1:04:00:: , and imparted to them his knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: and love---love%1:09:00:: of nature .
Out of this background---background%1:07:00:: of hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: and fishing---fishing%1:04:00:: , it was only natural that Roy---person%1:03:00:: first painted subjects---subject%1:06:00:: he knew best : hunters---hunter%1:18:00:: in the field---field%1:17:00:: , fishermen---fisherman%1:18:00:: in the stream---stream%1:17:00:: , ducks---duck%1:05:00:: and geese---goose%1:05:00:: on the wing - almost always against a vast backdrop---backdrop%1:06:00:: of weather---weather%1:19:00:: landscape---landscape%1:15:00:: .
It is this subject matter---subject_matter%1:10:00:: that has brought Mason---person%1:03:00:: a large and enthusiastic following---following%1:14:00:: among sportsmen---sportsman%1:18:00:: , but it is his exceptional performance---performance%1:04:00:: with this motif---motif%1:06:00:: that commends him to artists---artist%1:18:00:: and discerning collectors---collector%1:18:01:: .
Mason---person%1:03:00:: had to earn the privilege---privilege%1:07:02:: of devoting himself exclusively to painting---painting%1:04:00:: .
Like many others , he had to work hard , long hours---hours%1:28:00:: in a struggling family business---family_business%1:14:00:: which , though it was allied to art---art%1:04:00:: of a kind---kind%1:09:00:: - the design---design%1:04:00:: and production---production%1:04:00:: of engraved seals---seal%1:06:00:: - bore no relation---relation%1:03:00:: to the painting---painting%1:04:00:: of pictures---picture%1:06:01:: .
But it did teach Roy---person%1:03:00:: the basic techniques---technique%1:09:00:: of commercial art---commercial_art%1:06:00:: , and later , for twelve years---year%1:28:01:: , he and his sister---sister%1:18:00:: Nina---person%1:03:00:: conducted an advertising---advertising%1:10:00:: art---art%1:06:00:: studio---studio%1:06:00:: in Philadelphia---location%1:03:00:: .
On the death---death%1:11:00:: of their father---father%1:18:00:: , they returned to their home---home%1:15:04:: in Batavia---location%1:03:00:: , New York---new_york%1:15:00:: .
After more years---year%1:28:01:: of concentrated effort---effort%1:04:01:: , Roy---person%1:03:00:: and his brother---brother%1:18:00:: Max---person%1:03:00:: finally established a thriving family business---family_business%1:14:00:: at the old stand---stand%1:06:05:: .
During all this time---time%1:28:05:: Roy---person%1:03:00:: continued to paint , first only on weekends---weekend%1:28:00:: , and then , as the family business---family_business%1:14:00:: permitted , for longer periods---period%1:28:00:: .
Gradually he withdrew from the shop---shop%1:06:00:: altogether , and for the past thirty years---year%1:28:01:: , he has worked independently as a painter---painter%1:18:00:: , except for his continued hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: and fishing---fishing%1:04:00:: expeditions---expedition%1:04:02:: .
But even on these , the palette---palette%1:06:00:: often takes over while the shotgun---shotgun%1:06:00:: cools off !
Except for a rich friendship---friendship%1:26:00:: with the painter---painter%1:18:00:: , Chauncey Ryder---person%1:03:00:: who gave him the only professional instruction---instruction%1:04:01:: he ever had - and this was limited to a few lessons---lesson%1:04:01:: , though the two artists---artist%1:18:00:: often went on painting---painting%1:04:00:: trips---trip%1:04:00:: together - Roy---person%1:03:00:: developed his art---art%1:09:00:: by himself .
In the best tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: , he first taught himself to see , then to draw with accuracy---accuracy%1:07:02:: and assurance---assurance%1:09:00:: , and then to paint .
He worked in oil---oil%1:06:01:: for years---year%1:28:01:: before beginning his work---work%1:04:00:: in watercolor---watercolor%1:06:01:: , and his first public recognition---recognition%1:26:00:: and early honors---honor%1:10:00:: , including his election---election%1:04:00:: to the Academy---academy%1:14:02:: , were for his essays---essay%1:04:00:: in the heavier medium---medium%1:10:00:: .
Gradually watercolor---watercolor%1:06:01:: claimed his greater affection---affection%1:12:00:: until today---today%1:28:00:: it has become his major , if not exclusive , technique---technique%1:09:00:: .
It has been my privilege---privilege%1:07:02:: to paint with Roy Mason---person%1:03:00:: on numerous occasions---occasion%1:11:00:: , mostly in the vicinity---vicinity%1:15:00:: of Batavia---location%1:03:00:: .
More often than not I have found easy excuse---excuse%1:10:00:: to leave my own work---work%1:04:00:: and stand at a respectable distance---distance%1:07:00:: where I could watch this man---man%1:18:00:: transform raw nature into a composed , not imitative , painting---painting%1:06:00:: .
What I have observed time and time again is a process of integration---integration%1:04:02:: , integration---integration%1:04:02:: that begins as abstract design---design%1:09:02:: and gradually takes on recognizable form---form%1:07:01:: ; color---color%1:07:00:: patterns---pattern%1:06:00:: that are made to weave throughout the whole composition---composition%1:07:02:: ; and that over all , amazing control---control%1:09:01:: of large washes---wash%1:06:02:: which is the Mason---person%1:03:00:: stylemark---stylemark%1:07:00:: .
Finally come those little flicks---flick%1:11:00:: of a rigger---rigger%1:18:00:: brush---brush%1:06:00:: and the job---job%1:04:01:: is done .
But for the technical fact---fact%1:09:01:: , we have the artist---artist%1:18:00:: 's own testimony---testimony%1:10:01:: :
`` Of late years---year%1:28:01:: , I find that I like best to work out-of-doors .
First I make preliminary watercolor---watercolor%1:06:01:: sketches---sketch%1:06:00:: in quarter---quarter%1:23:01:: scale---scale%1:24:01:: ( approximately * * f inches---inch%1:23:00:: ) in which I pay particular attention---attention%1:09:00:: to the design---design%1:04:00:: principles---principle%1:09:03:: of three simple values---value%1:07:01:: - the lightest light---light%1:07:00:: , the middle---middle%1:09:00:: tone---tone%1:07:00:: , and the darkest dark---dark%1:15:00:: - by reducing the forms---form%1:07:01:: of my subject---subject%1:06:00:: to these large patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: .
If a human figure---figure%1:06:00:: or wild life---wildlife%1:14:00:: are to be part---part%1:24:00:: of the projected final picture---picture%1:06:01:: , I try to place them in the initial sketch---sketch%1:06:00:: .
For me , these will belong more completely to their surroundings---surroundings%1:15:00:: if they are conceived in this early stage---stage%1:28:00:: , though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures---figure%1:06:00:: on the full sheet---sheet%1:10:00:: when it serves my final purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: .
`` I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors---watercolor%1:06:00:: suffer because the artist---artist%1:18:00:: expects nature will do his composing---composing%1:07:00:: for him ; as a result---result%1:19:00:: , such pictures---picture%1:06:01:: are only a literal translation---translation%1:04:02:: of what the artist---artist%1:18:00:: finds in the scene---scene%1:09:00:: before him .
Just because a tree---tree%1:20:00:: or other object---object%1:03:00:: appears in a certain spot---spot%1:15:01:: is absolutely no reason---reason%1:16:00:: to place it in the same position---position%1:15:00:: in the painting---painting%1:06:00:: , unless the position---position%1:15:00:: serves the design---design%1:09:01:: of the whole composition---composition%1:07:02:: .
If the artist---artist%1:18:00:: would study his work---work%1:06:00:: more thoroughly and move certain units in his design---design%1:06:00:: , often only slightly , finer pictures---picture%1:06:01:: would result .
Out of long experience---experience%1:09:01:: I have found that incidental figures---figure%1:06:00:: and other objects---object%1:03:00:: like trees---tree%1:20:00:: , logs---log%1:27:01:: , and bushes---bush%1:20:00:: can be traced from the original sketch---sketch%1:06:00:: and moved about in the major areas---area%1:06:00:: on the final sheet---sheet%1:10:00:: until they occupy the right position---position%1:15:00:: , which I call ' clicking ' .
`` Speed---speed%1:07:00:: in painting a picture---picture%1:06:01:: is valid only when it imparts spontaneity---spontaneity%1:07:00:: and crispness---crispness%1:07:02:: , but unless the artist---artist%1:18:00:: has lots---lots%1:23:00:: of experience---experience%1:09:01:: so that he can control rapid execution---execution%1:04:02:: , he would do well to take these first sketches---sketch%1:06:00:: and soberly reorder their design---design%1:09:01:: to achieve a unified composition---composition%1:07:02:: .
`` If I have seemed to emphasize the structure---structure%1:07:00:: of the composition---composition%1:07:02:: , I mean to project equal concern---concern%1:09:00:: for color---color%1:07:00:: .
Often , in working out-of-doors under all conditions---condition%1:26:00:: of light---light%1:07:01:: and atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:00:: , a particular passage---passage%1:10:00:: that looked favorable in relation to the subject---subject%1:06:00:: will be too bright , too dull , or too light , or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat---mat%1:06:04:: .
When this occurs , I make the change---change%1:11:00:: on the sketch---sketch%1:06:00:: or on the final watercolor---watercolor%1:06:00:: - if I have been working on a full sheet---sheet%1:10:00:: in the field---field%1:17:00:: .
`` When working from one of my sketches---sketch%1:06:00:: I square it up and project its linear form---form%1:07:01:: freehand to the watercolor---watercolor%1:06:00:: sheet---sheet%1:10:00:: with charcoal---charcoal%1:06:00:: .
When this linear draft---draft%1:06:01:: is completed , I dust it down to a faint image---image%1:06:00:: .
From this point---point%1:26:00:: , I paint in as direct a manner---manner%1:07:02:: as possible , by flowing on the washes---wash%1:06:02:: with as pure a color---color%1:07:00:: mixture---mixture%1:27:00:: as I can manage .
However , first I thoughtfully study my sketch---sketch%1:06:00:: for improvement---improvement%1:04:00:: of color---color%1:07:00:: and design---design%1:09:01:: along the lines---line%1:14:02:: I have described .
Then I plan my attack---attack%1:04:03:: : the parts---part%1:09:00:: I will finish first , the range---range%1:07:00:: of values---value%1:07:01:: , the accenting---accenting%1:04:00:: of minor details---detail%1:09:00:: - all in all , mechanics---mechanics%1:04:00:: of producing the finished job---job%1:06:01:: with a maximum---maximum%1:07:00:: of crispness---crispness%1:07:02:: .
The longer I work , the more I am sure that for me , at least , a workmanlike method---method%1:09:00:: is important .
Trial and error---trial_and_error%1:04:00:: are better placed in the preliminary sketch---sketch%1:06:00:: than in hoping for miracles---miracle%1:11:00:: in the final painting---painting%1:06:00:: .
`` As for materials---material%1:06:01:: , I use the best available .
I work on a watercolor---watercolor%1:06:00:: easel---easel%1:06:00:: in the field---field%1:17:00:: , and frequently resort to a large garden---garden%1:06:00:: umbrella---umbrella%1:06:00:: to protect my eyes---eye%1:08:00:: from undue strain---strain%1:19:00:: .
In my studio---studio%1:06:00:: I work at a tilt-top table---tilt-top_table%1:06:00:: , but leave the paper---paper%1:27:00:: unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes---wash%1:06:02:: .
I have used a variety---variety%1:14:01:: of heavy-weight hand-made papers---paper%1:27:00:: , but prefer an English make---make%1:09:00:: , rough surface---surface%1:06:00:: , in 400 - pound---pound%1:23:09:: weight---weight%1:07:00:: .
After selecting a sheet---sheet%1:10:00:: and inspecting it for flaws---flaw%1:26:00:: ( even the best sometimes has foreign ' nubbins---nubbin%1:17:00:: ' on its surface---surface%1:06:00:: ) , I sponge it thoroughly on both sides---side%1:15:00:: with clean , cold water---water%1:27:00:: .
Then I dry the sheet---sheet%1:10:00:: under mild pressure---pressure%1:04:00:: so that it will lie flat as a board---board%1:06:00:: .
`` In addition to the usual tools---tool%1:06:00:: , I make constant use---use%1:07:02:: of cleansing tissue---tissue%1:27:02:: , not only to wipe my brushes---brush%1:06:00:: , but to mop up certain areas---area%1:15:01:: , to soften edges---edge%1:25:00:: , and to open up lights---light%1:07:00:: in dark washes---wash%1:06:02:: .
The great absorbency---absorbency%1:07:00:: of this tissue---tissue%1:27:02:: and the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that it is easier to control than a sponge---sponge%1:27:00:: makes it an ideal tool---tool%1:06:00:: for the watercolorist---watercolorist%1:18:00:: .
I also use a small electric hand blower---hand_blower%1:06:00:: to dry large washes---wash%1:06:02:: in the studio---studio%1:06:00:: .
`` My brushes---brush%1:06:00:: are different from those used by most watercolorists---watercolorist%1:18:00:: , for I combine the sable---sable%1:06:01:: and the bristle---bristle%1:06:00:: .
The red sables---sable%1:06:01:: are 8 ; two riggers---rigger%1:06:00:: , 6 and 10 ; and a very large , flat wash---wash%1:06:02:: brush---brush%1:06:00:: .
The bristles---bristle%1:06:00:: are a Fitch 2 and a one-half---one-half%1:23:00:: inch---inch%1:23:00:: brush---brush%1:06:00:: shaved to a sharp chisel---chisel%1:06:00:: edge---edge%1:06:00:: .
`` My usual palette---palette%1:07:00:: consists of top-quality colors---color%1:07:00:: :
alizarin crimson---alizarin_crimson%1:27:00:: , orange---orange%1:07:00:: , raw sienna---raw_sienna%1:07:00:: , raw umber---raw_umber%1:27:00:: , burnt sienna---burnt_sienna%1:07:00:: , sepia---sepia%1:07:00:: , cerulean blue---cerulean_blue%1:27:00:: , cobalt blue---cobalt_blue%1:07:00:: , French ultramarine blue---french_ultramarine_blue%1:27:00:: , Winsor green---windsor_green%1:27:00:: , Hooker's green---hooker's_green%1:27:00:: 2 , cadmium yellow---cadmium_yellow%1:27:00:: pale , yellow ochre---yellow_ochre%1:27:00:: , Payne's gray---payne's_gray%1:27:00:: , charcoal gray---charcoal_gray%1:07:00:: , Davy's gray---davy's_gray%1:27:00:: , and ivory black---ivory_black%1:27:00:: '' .
In analyzing the watercolors---watercolor%1:06:00:: of Roy Mason---person%1:03:00:: , the first thing---thing%1:07:00:: that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness---decorativeness%1:07:00:: , yet this word---word%1:10:00:: has such a varied connotation---connotation%1:10:00:: that it needs some elaboration---elaboration%1:04:01:: here .
True , a Mason---person%1:03:00:: watercolor---watercolor%1:06:00:: is unmistakably a synthesis---synthesis%1:09:00:: of nature rather than a detailed inventory---inventory%1:10:00:: .
Unlike many decorative patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: that present a static flat convention---convention%1:09:00:: , this artist---artist%1:18:00:: 's pictures---picture%1:06:01:: are full of atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: and climate---climate%1:26:00:: .
Long observation---observation%1:09:00:: has taught Mason---person%1:03:00:: that most landscape---landscape%1:15:00:: can be reduced to three essential planes---plane%1:25:00:: : a foreground---foreground%1:09:00:: in sharp focus---focus%1:07:01:: - either a light area---area%1:15:01:: with dark accents---accent%1:26:00:: or a dark one with lights---light%1:07:00:: ; a middle distance---middle_distance%1:09:00:: often containing the major motif---motif%1:06:00:: ; and a background---background%1:09:00:: , usually a silhouetted form---form%1:09:00:: foiled against the sky---sky%1:17:00:: .
In following this general principle---principle%1:09:03:: , Mason---person%1:03:00:: provides the observer---observer%1:18:00:: with a natural eye---eye%1:08:00:: progression---progression%1:14:00:: from foreground---foreground%1:09:00:: to background---background%1:09:00:: , and the illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: of depth---depth%1:07:00:: is instantly created .
When painting , Mason---person%1:03:00:: 's physical eyes---eye%1:08:00:: are half closed , while his mind's eye---mind's_eye%1:09:00:: is wide open , and this circumstance---circumstance%1:26:01:: accounts in part for the impression---impression%1:09:00:: he wishes to convey .
He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject---subject%1:06:00:: ; rather his pictures---picture%1:06:01:: invite the observer---observer%1:18:00:: to draw on his memory---memory%1:09:01:: , his imagination---imagination%1:09:02:: , his nostalgia---nostalgia%1:12:00:: .
It is for this reason---reason%1:10:01:: that Roy---person%1:03:00:: avoids selecting subjects---subject%1:06:00:: that require specific recognition---recognition%1:09:00:: of place---place%1:15:00:: for their enjoyment---enjoyment%1:12:00:: .
His pictures---picture%1:06:01:: generalize , though they are inspired by a particular locale---locale%1:15:00:: ; they universalize in terms of weather---weather%1:19:00:: , skies---sky%1:17:00:: , earth---earth%1:17:01:: , and people---people%1:14:00:: .
By dealing with common landscape---landscape%1:15:00:: in an uncommon way---way%1:07:01:: , Roy Mason---person%1:03:00:: has found a particular niche---niche%1:26:00:: in American landscape---landscape%1:06:01:: art---art%1:06:00:: .
Living---living%1:09:00:: with his watercolors---watercolor%1:06:00:: is a vicarious experience---experience%1:09:01:: of seeing nature distilled through the eyes---eye%1:08:00:: of a sensitive interpretor---interpreter%1:18:02:: , a breath---breath%1:10:00:: and breadth---breadth%1:07:00:: of the outdoor world---world%1:17:02:: to help man honor the Creator---creator%1:18:01:: of it all .
The artist---artist%1:18:00:: was born in Gilbert Mills---location%1:03:00:: , New York---new_york%1:15:00:: , in 1886 , and until two years---year%1:28:01:: ago when he and his wife---wife%1:18:00:: moved to California---california%1:15:00:: , he lived in western New York---new_york%1:15:00:: , in Batavia---location%1:03:00:: .
When I looked up the actual date---date%1:28:00:: of his birth---birth%1:11:00:: and found it to be March---march%1:28:00:: 15 th , I realized that Roy---person%1:03:00:: was born under the right zodiacal sign---sign%1:15:00:: for a watercolorist---watercolorist%1:18:00:: :
the water---water%1:27:02:: sign---sign%1:15:00:: of Pisces---pisces%1:15:00:: ( February---february%1:28:00:: 18 - March---march%1:28:00:: 20 ) .
And how very often a water---water%1:17:00:: plane---plane%1:25:00:: is featured in his landscapes---landscape%1:06:01:: , and how appropriate that he should appear in American Artist again , in his natal month---month%1:28:01:: of March---march%1:28:00:: !
Over the years---year%1:28:01:: , beginning in 1929 , Mason---person%1:03:00:: has been awarded seventeen major prizes---prize%1:21:00:: including two gold---gold%1:21:00:: medals---medal%1:10:00:: ; two Ranger Fund purchase awards ; the Joseph Pennell Memorial Medal ; two American Watercolor Society prizes ; the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor---watercolor%1:06:00:: , Art Institute---location%1:03:00:: of Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: ; and others in Buffalo---location%1:03:00:: , New York---new_york%1:15:00:: , Chautauqua---location%1:03:00:: , New Haven---new_haven%1:15:00:: , Rochester---location%1:03:00:: , Rockport---location%1:03:00:: , and most recently , the $ 300 prize---prize%1:21:00:: for a watercolor---watercolor%1:06:00:: at the Laguna Beach Art Association---group%1:03:00:: ,
He was elected to the National Academy of Design---group%1:03:00:: as an Associate---associate%1:18:00:: in the oil---oil%1:06:01:: class---class%1:14:00:: in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy---group%1:03:00:: in 1930 ) , and elevated to Academicianship---academicianship%1:04:00:: in 1940 .
Other memberships---membership%1:26:00:: include the American Watercolor Society---group%1:03:00:: , Philadelphia Water Color Club---group%1:03:00:: , Allied Artists of America---group%1:03:00:: , Audubon Artists---group%1:03:00:: , Baltimore Watercolor Society---group%1:03:00:: .
`` She says she has to finish a story---story%1:10:00:: '' .
`` I asked her why she could n't do it tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:01:: , but it seems the muse---muse%1:18:00:: is working good tonight---tonight%1:28:00:: and she 's afraid to let it go '' .
Casey---person%1:03:00:: made some comment---comment%1:10:00:: , but his mind---mind%1:09:00:: was busy as he considered the man---man%1:18:00:: .
His name---name%1:10:00:: was George Needham---person%1:03:00:: and he , too , had come from a good family---family%1:14:01:: .
He was perhaps thirty-two , nicely set up , with light brown---light_brown%1:07:00:: hair---hair%1:08:00:: that had a pronounced wave---wave%1:08:00:: .
He was always well groomed and well tailored , and he had that rich man---rich_man%1:18:00:: 's look---look%1:07:00:: which was authentic enough and came from two good prep schools---prep_school%1:14:00:: and a proper university---university%1:14:00:: .
An only child---child%1:18:01:: , he had done all the things---thing%1:04:00:: that young men---young_man%1:18:00:: do who have been born to money---money%1:21:02:: and social position---position%1:26:00:: until his father---father%1:18:00:: double-crossed him by dying broke .
Since then he had worked at this and that , though some said his main interest---interest%1:04:01:: was gambling---gambling%1:04:00:: .
All this went through Casey---person%1:03:00:: 's mind---mind%1:09:00:: in the first instant---instant%1:28:00:: , but what held his interest---interest%1:09:00:: was the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that these two should be together at all .
For he had understood that Betty---person%1:03:00:: had been engaged to a boy---boy%1:18:02:: named Barry Jenkins---person%1:03:00:: .
She had grown up with young Jenkins---person%1:03:00:: , and he had heard that they had been at the point---point%1:26:00:: of getting married at least twice .
He wanted to ask her about Jenkins---person%1:03:00:: now , but he knew he could n't do so in Needham---person%1:03:00:: 's presence---presence%1:15:00:: .
And so , still wondering and a little perplexed , he grinned at the girl---girl%1:18:03:: and spoke lightly to make sure that she would know he was kidding .
`` Oh , I 've known him quite a while---while%1:28:00:: '' .
She glanced at her companion---companion%1:18:00:: fondly .
`` Have n't I , George---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` I 've been after her for years---years%1:28:01:: '' , Needham---person%1:03:00:: said , `` but I 've never been able to get anywhere until the last few days---day%1:28:00:: '' .
The girl---girl%1:18:03:: 's eyes---eye%1:08:00:: were softly shining as she reached out and touched Casey---person%1:03:00:: 's hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
`` Can I tell you a secret---secret%1:10:00:: ?
Casey---person%1:03:00:: kept his smile---smile%1:10:00:: fixed , but some small inner disturbance---disturbance%1:11:00:: was working on him as he thought again about Needham---person%1:03:00:: , who was eight or ten years---year%1:28:01:: older than the girl---girl%1:18:03:: .
He wondered whether Needham---person%1:03:00:: was going to swear off gambling---gambling%1:04:00:: and get a steady job---job%1:04:00:: or whether he was counting on the income---income%1:21:00:: from Betty---person%1:03:00:: 's estate---estate%1:21:02:: to subsidize him .
None of this showed in his face---face%1:08:00:: , and he tried to keep his skepticism---skepticism%1:09:00:: in hand .
He made a point---point%1:09:02:: of frowning , of acting out the part---part%1:09:01:: of the fond father---father%1:18:00:: confessor---confessor%1:18:00:: .
`` I 'll have to give it some thought---thought%1:09:00:: '' , he said .
`` You would n't want me to say yes without making sure his intentions---intention%1:09:01:: are honorable , would you '' ?
She made a face---face%1:07:03:: at him and then she laughed .
`` I 'll get my references---reference%1:10:01:: in order '' , Needham---person%1:03:00:: said , and though he spoke with a smile---smile%1:10:00:: , Casey---person%1:03:00:: somehow got the idea---idea%1:09:03:: that he was not particularly amused .
`` Stop by any time---time%1:28:03:: , Casey---person%1:03:00:: '' .
He stood up and touched the girl---girl%1:18:03:: 's arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
`` Come on , darling---darling%1:18:00:: .
If you 're really serious about working on that story---story%1:10:00:: , I 'd better take you home---home%1:15:04:: '' .
Casey---person%1:03:00:: watched them go , still frowning absently and then dismissing the matter---matter%1:09:01:: as he called for his check---check%1:10:00:: .
As he went out he told Freddie---person%1:03:00:: the dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: was perfect , and when he got his hat---hat%1:06:00:: and coat---coat%1:06:00:: from Nancy Parks---person%1:03:00:: and put a fifty-piece piece---fifty-cent_piece%1:21:00:: in the slot---slot%1:06:00:: , he told her to be sure that it went toward her dowry---dowry%1:21:00:: .
A taxi---taxi%1:06:00:: took him back to the bar---bar%1:06:04:: and grill---grill%1:06:01:: where he had left his car---car%1:06:00:: , and a few minutes---minute%1:28:01:: later he found a parking place---parking_space%1:15:00:: across the street---street%1:06:01:: from his apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: .
Because his mind---mind%1:09:00:: had been otherwise occupied for the past couple---couple%1:23:01:: of hours---hour%1:28:01:: , he did not think to look and see if Jerry Burton---person%1:03:00:: 's car---car%1:06:00:: was still there .
In fact , he did not think about Jerry Burton---person%1:03:00:: at all until he entered his living room---living_room%1:06:00:: and closed the door---door%1:06:00:: behind him .
Only then , when his glance---glance%1:04:00:: focused on the divan---divan%1:06:00:: and saw that it was empty , did he remember his earlier problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
Even from where he stood he could see the neatly folded blanket---blanket%1:06:00:: that he had spread over Burton---person%1:03:00:: , the pillow---pillow%1:06:00:: , the sheet of paper---sheet_of_paper%1:10:00:: on top of it .
Then he was striding across the room---room%1:06:00:: , his thoughts---thought%1:09:00:: confused but the worry---worry%1:12:00:: building swiftly inside him as he snatched up the note---note%1:10:03:: .
Jack---person%1:03:00:: :
Look in the wastebasket---wastebasket%1:06:00:: .
I knew the only way---way%1:07:01:: I could beat you was to play possum , but it was a good try---try%1:04:00:: , kid , and I appreciate it .
The wastebasket---wastebasket%1:06:00:: stood near the wall---wall%1:06:00:: next to the divan---divan%1:06:00:: , and the instant---instant%1:28:00:: Casey---person%1:03:00:: picked it up he knew what had happened .
The discarded papers---papers%1:10:00:: inside were sodden , there was a glint---glint%1:11:00:: of liquid at the bottom---bottom%1:15:00:: , and the smell---smell%1:09:02:: of whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: was strong and distinct .
He put the basket---wastebasket%1:06:00:: down distastefully , muttering softly and thoroughly disgusted with himself and his plan---plan%1:09:00:: that had seemed so foolproof .
For he remembered too well how he had brought back the loaded drinks---drink%1:13:04:: to Burton---person%1:03:00:: and then returned to the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: to get weaker drinks---drink%1:13:04:: for himself .
For another second---second%1:28:01:: or two he gave in to the annoyance---annoyance%1:12:00:: that was directed at himself ; then his mind---mind%1:09:00:: moved on to be confronted by something far more serious , and as the thought---thought%1:09:01:: expanded , the implications---implication%1:09:00:: jarred him .
It no longer mattered that Burton---person%1:03:00:: had outsmarted him .
The important thing---thing%1:26:00:: was that Burton---person%1:03:00:: had gone somewhere to meet a blackmailer---blackmailer%1:18:00:: with a gun---gun%1:06:00:: in his pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: .
And that gun---gun%1:06:00:: was empty .
Even before his mind---mind%1:09:00:: had rounded out the idea---idea%1:09:00:: , he thrust one hand---hand%1:08:00:: into his trousers---trouser%1:06:00:: pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: and pulled out the six slugs---slug%1:06:00:: he had taken from the revolver---revolver%1:06:00:: .
He considered them with brooding eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , brows---brow%1:08:01:: bunched as his brain---brain%1:09:01:: grappled with the problem---problem%1:26:00:: and tried to find some solution---solution%1:09:00:: .
He said : `` The crazy fool---fool%1:18:00:: '' , half aloud .
He put the shells---shell%1:06:00:: on the table---table%1:06:01:: , as though he could no longer bear to hold them .
There was no answer---answer%1:10:02:: to this and he began to pace back and forth across the room---room%1:06:00:: , his imagination---imagination%1:09:02:: out of control---control%1:07:00:: .
He tried to tell himself that maybe Burton---person%1:03:00:: had sobered up enough to get some sense---sense%1:09:04:: .
Maybe he only intended to scare the blackmailer---blackmailer%1:18:00:: , whoever he was , in which case an unloaded gun---gun%1:06:00:: would be good enough .
He thought of other possibilities---possibility%1:09:00:: , none of them satisfactory , and finally he began to think , to wonder if there was some way---way%1:07:01:: he could reach Burton---person%1:03:00:: .
Then , as he turned toward the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: , it rang shrilly to shatter the stillness---stillness%1:07:00:: in the room---room%1:06:00:: and he reached for it eagerly .
`` Casey---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` Tony Calenda---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Casey---person%1:03:00:: heard the voice---voice%1:07:00:: distinctly and he knew who it was , but it took him a while---while%1:28:00:: to make the mental readjustment---readjustment%1:04:00:: and control the disturbance---disturbance%1:26:02:: inside his head---head%1:09:00:: .
When he heard Calenda say : `` What about that picture you took this afternoon '' ? it still took him another few seconds to remember the job---job%1:04:01:: he had done for Frank Ackerly .
When he heard Calenda---person%1:03:00:: say : `` What about that picture---picture%1:06:00:: you took this afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: '' ? it still took him another few seconds---second%1:28:01:: to remember the job---job%1:04:05:: he had done for Frank Ackerly---person%1:03:00:: .
`` What picture---picture%1:06:00:: '' ? he demanded .
`` You took a picture---picture%1:06:00:: of me at the corner---corner%1:06:00:: of Washington---location%1:03:00:: and Blake---location%1:03:00:: about three thirty this afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: '' .
`` One of my boys---boy%1:18:02:: '' .
Casey---person%1:03:00:: believed that much .
Calenda---person%1:03:00:: was not the sort---sort%1:18:00:: who walked around without one of his `` boys---boy%1:18:02:: '' close at hand .
`` With my trial coming up in Federal Court---federal_court%1:14:00:: next week---week%1:28:02:: I would n't want that picture---picture%1:06:00:: published '' .
Under normal circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: Casey---person%1:03:00:: was a little fussy when people---people%1:14:00:: told him what to do with pictures---picture%1:06:00:: he had taken .
Even so , he generally listened and was usually reasonable to those who voiced their objections---objection%1:10:01:: properly .
Right now , however , he was still too worried about Jerry Burton---person%1:03:00:: , and the gun---gun%1:06:00:: that had no bullets---bullet%1:06:00:: , and the story---story%1:10:03:: Burton---person%1:03:00:: had told him , to care too much about Tony Calenda---person%1:03:00:: .
His nerves---nerves%1:07:00:: were getting a little ragged and his impatience---impatience%1:26:00:: put an edge---edge%1:07:01:: in his voice---voice%1:07:00:: .
His nerves were getting a little ragged and his impatience---impatience%1:12:00:: put an edge in his voice .
`` I was hired to take a picture---picture%1:06:00:: .
`` Maybe you 'd better tell the guy---guy%1:18:00:: who hired you what I said '' .
`` All right '' , Calenda---person%1:03:00:: said , his voice---voice%1:07:00:: still quiet .
`` But I meant what I said , Casey---person%1:03:00:: .
If that picture---picture%1:06:00:: gets around and I find out you had anything to do with it , I 'm going to send a couple of my boys---boy%1:18:02:: around to see you '' .
`` You do that '' , Casey---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Just be sure to send your two best boys---boy%1:18:02:: , Tony---person%1:03:00:: '' .
He hung up with a bang---bang%1:11:00:: , annoyed at himself for running off at the mouth like that but still terribly concerned with the situation---situation%1:26:00:: he had helped to create .
As soon as he could think logically again he reached for the telephone directory---telephone_directory%1:10:00:: and found Jerry Burton---person%1:03:00:: 's home number---number%1:10:03:: .
He dialed it and listened to it ring ten times---time%1:11:00:: before he hung up .
He called the bar---bar%1:06:04:: and grill---grill%1:06:01:: where he had picked Burton---person%1:03:00:: up that afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: .
When he was told that no one---one%1:23:00:: had seen Burton---person%1:03:00:: since then---then%1:28:00:: , he thought of three other places---place%1:15:04:: that were possibilities---possibility%1:26:00:: .
Each time---time%1:11:01:: he got the same answer---answer%1:10:01:: and in the end he gave up .
By the time---time%1:11:00:: he had smoked three cigarettes---cigarette%1:06:00:: he had calmed down .
And anyway Burton---person%1:03:00:: was not the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of guy---guy%1:18:00:: who would be likely to get in trouble even when he was drunk .
He , Casey---person%1:03:00:: , had been scared for a while , but that had come mostly from the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that he felt responsible .
He should have stayed here and watched Burton---person%1:03:00:: .
So he made a mistake---mistake%1:04:00:: .
He kept telling himself this as he went out to the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: to make a drink---drink%1:13:04:: .
Only then did he decide he did n't want one---one%1:23:00:: .
He considered opening a can---can%1:06:00:: of beer---beer%1:13:00:: but vetoed that idea---idea%1:09:00:: too .
Finally he went into the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: and sat down to take off his shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: .
He had just finished unlacing the right one---one%1:23:00:: when the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: rang again .
When he snatched it up the voice---voice%1:07:00:: that came to him was quick and urgent .
`` Casey---person%1:03:00:: ?
If you want a picture---picture%1:06:00:: get to the corner---corner%1:06:00:: of Adams---location%1:03:00:: and Clark---location%1:03:00:: just as fast as you can .
If you hurry you might beat the headquarters---headquarters%1:06:01:: boys---boy%1:18:02:: '' .
Casey---person%1:03:00:: heard the click---click%1:11:00:: of the distant receiver---receiver%1:06:01:: before he could open his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: , and it took him no more than three seconds---second%1:28:00:: to make his decision .
For over the years---year%1:28:01:: he had received many such calls---call%1:10:01:: .
Some of them came from people---people%1:14:00:: who identified themselves .
Some telephoned because he had done them a favor---favor%1:04:00:: in the past---past%1:28:00:: .
Others because they expected some sort of reward---reward%1:10:00:: for the information .
Others because they expected some sort---sort%1:09:00:: of reward---reward%1:21:00:: for the information---information%1:10:00:: .
A few passed along a tip---tip%1:10:00:: for the simple reason---reason%1:16:00:: that they liked him and wanted to give him a break---break%1:11:01:: .
Only an occasional tip---tip%1:10:00:: turned out to be a phony , and , like the police---police%1:14:00:: , Casey---person%1:03:00:: had made a point---point%1:09:02:: of running down all such suggestions---suggestion%1:09:00:: and he did not hesitate this time---time%1:11:00:: .
He was in his car---car%1:06:00:: with his camera---camera%1:06:00:: and equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: bag---bag%1:06:00:: in less than two minutes---minute%1:28:00:: , and it took him only three more to reach the corner---corner%1:06:00:: , a block---block%1:06:00:: from Columbus Avenue---location%1:03:00:: .
It was a district---district%1:15:00:: of small factories---factory%1:06:00:: and loft---loft%1:06:02:: buildings---building%1:06:00:: and occasional tenements---tenement%1:06:00:: , and he could see the police radio car---police_car%1:06:00:: as he rounded the corner---corner%1:06:00:: and slammed on the brakes---brake%1:06:00:: .
He did not bother with his radio - there would be time for that later - but as he scrambled out on the pavement---pavement%1:06:00:: he saw the filling station and the public telephone booth and knew instantly how he had been summoned .
He did not bother with his radio---radio%1:06:01:: - there would be time---time%1:28:05:: for that later - but as he scrambled out on the pavement---pavement%1:06:01:: he saw the filling station---filling_station%1:06:00:: and the public telephone booth---telephone_booth%1:06:00:: and knew instantly how he had been summoned .
The police car---police_car%1:06:00:: had pulled up behind a small sedan---sedan%1:06:00:: , its headlights---headlight%1:06:00:: still on .
Analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: means the evaluation---evaluation%1:04:00:: of subparts---subpart%1:24:00:: , the comparative ratings---rating%1:26:00:: of parts---part%1:09:00:: , the comprehension---comprehension%1:09:00:: of the meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: of isolated elements---element%1:09:00:: .
Analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: in roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: is usually done for the purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of understanding strong---strong_point%1:07:00:: and weak points---weak_point%1:07:00:: of an individual---individual%1:03:00:: or as a process---process%1:04:00:: to eliminate weak parts---weak_part%1:07:00:: and strengthen good parts---good_part%1:07:00:: .
Up to this point---point%1:26:00:: stress---stress%1:26:03:: has been placed on roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: in terms of individuals---individual%1:03:00:: .
Roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: can be done for quite a different purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: : to evaluate procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: , regardless of individuals---individual%1:03:00:: .
For example : a sales---sale%1:04:02:: presentation---presentation%1:04:00:: can be analyzed and evaluated through roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: .
Let us now put some flesh on the theoretical bones we have assembled by giving illustrations---illustration%1:10:01:: of roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: used for evaluation---evaluation%1:04:00:: and analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: .
One should keep in mind---mind%1:09:01:: that many of the exciting possiblities---possibility%1:09:03:: of roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: are largely unexplored and have not been used in industry---industry%1:04:00:: to the extent---extent%1:26:00:: that they have been in military and other areas---area%1:26:00:: .
The president---president%1:18:01:: of a small firm---firm%1:14:00:: selling restaurant---restaurant%1:06:00:: products---product%1:06:01:: , had considerable difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: in finding suitable salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: for his business---business%1:14:00:: .
The president of a small firm selling restaurant products , had considerable difficulty in finding suitable salesmen for his business---business%1:04:01:: .
Interviewing , checking references---reference%1:10:01:: , training the salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: , having them go with more experienced salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: was expensive - and the rate of attrition---rate_of_attrition%1:28:00:: due to resignations---resignation%1:10:00:: or unsatisfactory performance was too high .
It was his experience---experience%1:09:01:: that only one good salesman---salesman%1:18:00:: was found out of every seven hired - and only one was hired out of every seven interviewed .
Roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: was offered as a solution---solution%1:09:00:: - and the procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: worked as follows : all candidates---candidate%1:18:00:: were invited to a hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: conference room---conference_room%1:06:00:: , where the president---president%1:18:01:: explained the difficulty---difficulty%1:26:00:: he had , and how unnecessary it seemed to him to hire people---people%1:14:00:: who just did not work out .
In place of asking salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: to fill questionnaires---questionnaire%1:10:00:: , checking their references---reference%1:10:01:: , interviewing them , asking them to be tried out , he told them he would prefer to test them .
Each person---person%1:03:00:: was to enter the testing room---testing_room%1:06:00:: , carrying a suitcase---suitcase%1:06:00:: of samples---sample%1:09:00:: .
Each salesman---salesman%1:18:00:: was to read a sheet---sheet%1:10:00:: containing a description---description%1:10:01:: of the product---product%1:06:01:: .
In the testing room---testing_room%1:06:00:: he was to make , successively , three presentations---presentation%1:04:00:: to three different people---people%1:14:00:: .
In the testing room---testing_room%1:06:00:: , three of the veteran salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: served as antagonists---antagonist%1:18:00:: .
One handled the salesman---salesman%1:18:00:: in a friendly manner---manner%1:07:01:: , another in a rough manner---manner%1:07:01:: , and the third---third%1:24:00:: in a hesitating manner---manner%1:07:01:: .
Each was told to purchase material---material%1:06:01:: if he felt like it .
The antagonists---antagonist%1:18:00:: came in , one at a time , and did not see or hear the other presentations---presentation%1:04:00:: .
After each presentation---presentation%1:04:00:: , the antagonist---antagonist%1:18:00:: wrote his judgment---judgment%1:04:02:: of the salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: ; and so did the observers---observer%1:18:01:: consisting of the president---president%1:18:01:: , three---three%1:23:00:: of his salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: and a psychologist---psychologist%1:18:00:: .
Ten salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: were tested in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: and ten more in the afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: .
This procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: was repeated one day---day%1:28:01:: a month---month%1:28:01:: for four months---month%1:28:01:: .
The batting average---batting_average%1:24:01:: of one success---success%1:04:00:: out of seven increased to one out of three .
The president---president%1:18:01:: of the firm---firm%1:14:00:: , calculating expenses---expense%1:21:00:: alone , felt his costs---cost%1:21:00:: had dropped one-half---one-half%1:23:00:: while success---success%1:11:00:: in selection---selection%1:04:00:: had improved over one hundred per cent---percent%1:24:00:: .
The reason---reason%1:10:01:: for the value---value%1:07:00:: of this procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: was simply that the applicants---applicant%1:18:00:: were tested `` at work---work%1:04:01:: '' in different situations---situation%1:26:01:: by the judgment---judgment%1:09:00:: of a number---number%1:07:00:: of experts---expert%1:18:00:: who could see how the salesmen---salesman%1:18:00:: conducted themselves with different , but typical restaurant---restaurant%1:06:00:: owners---owner%1:18:00:: and managers---manager%1:18:00:: .
They were , in a sense , `` tried out '' in realistic situations---situation%1:26:01:: .
From the point of view---point_of_view%1:09:00:: of the applicants---applicant%1:18:00:: , less time---time%1:28:05:: was wasted in being evaluated - and they got a meal---meal%1:13:00:: out of it as well as some insights---insight%1:09:02:: into their performances .
Another use---use%1:04:00:: of roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: for evaluation---evaluation%1:04:00:: illustrates how this procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: can be used in real life---real_life%1:09:00:: situations---situation%1:26:01:: without special equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: or special assistants---assistant%1:18:00:: during the daily course---course%1:14:00:: of work---work%1:04:00:: .
The position---position%1:04:01:: of receptionist---receptionist%1:18:00:: was opened in a large office---office%1:06:00:: and an announcement---announcement%1:10:00:: was made to the other girls---girl%1:18:00:: already working that they could apply for this job---job%1:04:00:: which had higher prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: and slightly higher salary---salary%1:21:00:: than typing---typing%1:10:00:: and clerking---clerking%1:04:00:: positions---position%1:04:01:: .
All applicants---applicant%1:18:00:: were generally familiar with the work---work%1:04:01:: of the receptionist---receptionist%1:18:00:: .
At the end---end%1:11:00:: of work---work%1:04:01:: one day---day%1:28:04:: , the personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: man---man%1:18:00:: took the applicants---applicant%1:18:00:: one at a time , asked them to sit behind the receptionist---receptionist%1:18:00:: 's desk---desk%1:06:00:: and he then played the role---role%1:04:01:: of a number---number%1:07:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: who might come to the receptionist---receptionist%1:18:00:: with a number---number%1:07:00:: of queries---query%1:10:00:: and for a number---number%1:07:00:: of purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: .
At the end of work one day , the personnel man took the applicants one at a time , asked them to sit behind the receptionist 's desk and he then played the role---role%1:09:00:: of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of queries and for a number of purposes .
Each girl---girl%1:18:00:: was independently `` tested '' by the personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: man---man%1:18:00:: , and he served not only as the director---director%1:18:00:: , but as the antagonist---antagonist%1:18:00:: and the observer---observer%1:18:01:: .
Somewhat to his surprise he found that one girl , whom he would never have considered for the job since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office a relatively short time , did the most outstanding job of playing the role---role%1:09:00:: of receptionist , showing wit , sparkle , and aplomb .
Somewhat to his surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: he found that one girl---girl%1:18:00:: , whom he would never have considered for the job---job%1:04:00:: since she had appeared somewhat mousy and also had been in the office---office%1:06:00:: a relatively short time---time%1:28:05:: , did the most outstanding job---job%1:04:05:: of playing the role---role%1:04:00:: of receptionist---receptionist%1:18:00:: , showing wit---wit%1:10:00:: , sparkle---sparkle%1:07:01:: , and aplomb---aplomb%1:07:00:: .
She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role---role%1:04:00:: eight hours---hours%1:28:00:: a day---day%1:28:04:: .
She was hired and was found to be entirely satisfactory when she played the role---role%1:09:00:: eight hours a day .
In considering roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: for analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: we enter a more complex area---area%1:09:00:: , since we are now no longer dealing with a simple over-all decision---decision%1:04:00:: but rather with the examination---examination%1:04:00:: and evaluation---evaluation%1:04:00:: of many elements---element%1:09:00:: seen in dynamic functioning .
Some cases---case%1:11:00:: in evidence of the use---use%1:04:00:: of roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: for analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: may help explain the procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: .
An engineer---engineer%1:18:00:: had been made the works---works%1:06:02:: manager---manager%1:18:00:: of a firm---firm%1:14:00:: , supplanting a retired employee---employee%1:18:00:: who had been considered outstandingly successful .
The engineer---engineer%1:18:00:: had more than seven years---year%1:28:01:: of experience---experience%1:09:01:: in the firm---firm%1:14:00:: , was well trained , was considered a hard worker---hard_worker%1:18:00:: , was respected by his fellow engineers---engineer%1:18:00:: for his technical competence---competence%1:07:00:: and was regarded as a `` comer---comer%1:18:01:: '' .
However , he turned out to be a complete failure---failure%1:18:00:: in his new position---position%1:04:01:: .
Turnover---turnover%1:24:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: of personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: went up , production---production%1:04:00:: dropped , and morale---morale%1:07:00:: was visibly reduced .
Despite the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that he was regarded as an outstanding engineer---engineer%1:18:00:: , he seemed to be a very poor administrator---administrator%1:18:00:: , although no one quite knew what was wrong with him .
At the insistence---insistence%1:10:00:: of his own supervisor---supervisor%1:18:00:: - the president---president%1:18:01:: of the firm---firm%1:14:00:: , he enrolled in a course---course%1:04:01:: designed to develop leaders---leader%1:18:00:: .
He played a number---number%1:07:00:: of typical situations---situation%1:26:01:: before observers---observer%1:18:01:: , other supervisors---supervisor%1:18:00:: who kept notes---note%1:10:00:: and then explained to him in detail what he did they thought was wrong .
Entirely concerned with efficiency---efficiency%1:09:00:: , he was merciless in criticizing people---people%1:14:00:: who made mistakes---mistake%1:04:00:: , condemning them to too great an extent---extent%1:26:00:: .
He did not really listen to others , had little interest---interest%1:09:00:: in their ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , and wanted to have his own way---way%1:09:00:: - which was the only right way---way%1:09:00:: .
The entire group---group%1:03:00:: of managers---manager%1:18:00:: explained , in great detail---detail%1:10:00:: , a number---number%1:07:00:: of human relations---relations%1:24:00:: errors---error%1:04:02:: that he made .
One by one , these errors---error%1:04:02:: were discussed and one by one he rejected accepting them as errors---error%1:04:02:: .
He admitted his behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: , and defended it .
He refused to change his approach---approach%1:04:02:: , and instead he attacked high and low - the officials---official%1:18:01:: for their not backing him , and subordinates---subordinate%1:18:00:: for their laxness---laxness%1:07:00:: , stupidity---stupidity%1:09:00:: , and stubbornness---stubbornness%1:07:00:: .
After the diagnosing---diagnosing%1:04:00:: , he left the course---course%1:04:01:: , convinced that it could do him no good .
We may say that his problem---problem%1:26:00:: was diagnosed but that he refused treatment---treatment%1:10:00:: .
The engineer---engineer%1:18:00:: turned works---works%1:06:02:: manager---manager%1:18:00:: had a particular view---view%1:09:02:: of life---life%1:09:00:: - and refused to change it .
We may say that his attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: was foolish , since he may have been a success---success%1:18:00:: had he learned some human relations---relations%1:24:00:: skills---skill%1:09:01:: ; or we may say that his attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: was commendable , showing his independence---independence%1:26:00:: of mind---mind%1:09:04:: , in his refusal---refusal%1:10:01:: to adjust to the opinions---opinion%1:09:00:: of others .
In any case , he refused to accept the implications---implication%1:09:01:: of the analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: , that he needed to be made over .
Another case---case%1:11:00:: may be given in illustration---illustration%1:10:01:: of a successful use---use%1:04:00:: of analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: , and also of the employment---employment%1:04:01:: of a procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: for intensive analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: .
In a course---course%1:04:01:: for supermarket---supermarket%1:06:00:: operators---operator%1:18:01:: , a district manager---district_manager%1:18:00:: who had been recently appointed to his position---position%1:04:01:: after being outstandingly successful as a store---store%1:06:00:: manager---manager%1:18:00:: , found that in supervising other managers---manager%1:18:00:: he was having a difficult time---time%1:11:01:: .
On playing some typical situations---situation%1:26:01:: before a jury---jury%1:14:01:: of his peers---peer%1:18:00:: he showed some characteristics---characteristic%1:07:00:: rated as unsatisfactory .
He was told he displayed , for example , a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of superiority---superiority%1:07:02:: - and he answered : `` Well , I am supposed to know all the answers---answer%1:10:02:: , are n't I '' ?
He was criticized for his curtness---curtness%1:07:00:: and abruptness---abruptness%1:07:02:: - and he answered : `` I am not working to become popular '' .
On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior - he answered : `` I have to make decisions---decision%1:09:00:: .
On being criticized for his arbitrary behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: - he answered : `` I have to make decisions---decision%1:04:00:: .
That 's my job---job%1:04:04:: '' .
In short , as frequently happens in analyses---analysis%1:04:00:: , the individual---individual%1:03:00:: feels threatened and defends himself .
However , in this case---case%1:26:00:: the district manager---district_manager%1:18:00:: was led to see the errors---error%1:04:02:: of his ways---way%1:09:00:: .
However , in this case---case%1:11:00:: the district manager was led to see the errors---error%1:07:00:: of his ways .
The necessary step---step%1:04:02:: between diagnosis---diagnosis%1:04:00:: and training---training%1:04:00:: is acceptance---acceptance%1:09:00:: of the validity---validity%1:07:01:: of the criticisms---criticism%1:09:00:: .
How this was accomplished may be described , since this sometimes is a crucial problem---problem%1:10:00:: .
The director---director%1:18:00:: helped tailor-make a check list---checklist%1:10:00:: of the district manager---district_manager%1:18:00:: 's errors---error%1:04:02:: by asking various observers---observer%1:18:01:: to write out sentences---sentence%1:10:00:: commenting on the mistakes---mistake%1:04:00:: they felt he made .
These errors---error%1:04:02:: were then collected and written on a blackboard---blackboard%1:06:00:: , condensing similar ideas---idea%1:09:00:: .
Eighteen errors---error%1:04:02:: were located , and then the director---director%1:18:00:: asked each individual---individual%1:03:00:: to vote whether or not they felt that this manager---manager%1:18:00:: had made the particular errors---error%1:04:02:: .
They were asked to vote `` true '' if they thought they had seen him make the error---error%1:04:02:: , `` false '' if they thought he had not ; and `` cannot say '' if they were not certain .
The manager---manager%1:18:00:: sat behind the group---group%1:03:00:: so he could see and count the hands---hand%1:08:00:: that went up , and the director---director%1:18:00:: wrote the numbers---number%1:07:00:: on the blackboard---blackboard%1:06:00:: .
No comments---comment%1:10:00:: were made during the voting---voting%1:04:00:: .
The results---result%1:11:00:: looked as follows :
The first eight of these eighteen statements---statement%1:10:00:: , which received at least one-half---one-half%1:23:00:: of the votes---vote%1:04:00:: , were duplicated to form an analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: checklist---checklist%1:10:00:: for the particular manager---manager%1:18:00:: , and when this particular manager---manager%1:18:00:: roleplayed in other situations---situation%1:26:01:: , the members---member%1:18:00:: checked any items---item%1:10:00:: that appeared .
To prevent the manager---manager%1:18:00:: from deliberately controlling himself only during the sessions---session%1:04:00:: , they were rather lengthy ( about twenty minutes---minute%1:28:00:: ) , the situations---situation%1:26:01:: were imperfectly described to the manager---manager%1:18:00:: so that he would not know what to expect , new antagonists---antagonist%1:18:00:: were brought on the scene---scene%1:15:00:: unexpectedly , and the antagonists---antagonist%1:18:00:: were instructed to deliberately behave in such ways---way%1:07:01:: as to upset the manager---manager%1:18:00:: and get him to operate in a manner---manner%1:07:02:: for which he had been previously criticized .
After every session---session%1:04:00:: , the check marks---check_mark%1:10:00:: were totaled up and graphed , and in this way---way%1:04:01:: the supervisor---supervisor%1:18:00:: 's progress---progress%1:04:01:: was charted .
In life---life%1:09:00:: we learn to play our roles---role%1:04:00:: and we `` freeze '' into patterns---pattern%1:04:00:: which become so habitual that we are not really aware of what we do .
To learn what we do is the first step---first_step%1:04:00:: for improvement---improvement%1:11:00:: .
To accept the validity---validity%1:07:01:: of the judgments---judgment%1:09:04:: of others is the second step---step%1:04:02:: .
To want to change is the third step---step%1:04:02:: .
To practice new procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: under guided supervision---supervision%1:04:00:: and with constant feedback---feedback%1:10:00:: is the fourth step---step%1:04:02:: .
To use these new ways---way%1:04:01:: in daily life---life%1:26:01:: is the last step---step%1:04:02:: .
Roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: used for analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: follows these general steps---step%1:04:02:: leading to training---training%1:04:00:: .
When an evaluative situation---situation%1:26:01:: is set up , and no concern---concern%1:09:00:: is with the details---detail%1:09:00:: that lead to an over-all estimate---estimate%1:04:01:: , we say that roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: is used for evaluation---evaluation%1:04:00:: .
Observers---observer%1:18:01:: can see a person---person%1:03:00:: engaged in spontaneous behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: , and watch him operating in a totalistic fashion---fashion%1:07:00:: .
This behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: is more `` veridical '' - or true than other testing---testing%1:04:02:: behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: for some types---type%1:09:00:: of evaluation---evaluation%1:04:00:: , and so can give quick and accurate estimates---estimate%1:04:01:: of complex functioning .
While roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: for testing---testing%1:04:02:: is not too well understood at the present time---time%1:28:00:: , it represents one of the major uses---use%1:04:00:: of this procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: .
The objective---objective%1:09:00:: of this chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: is to clarify the distinctions---distinction%1:07:00:: between spontaneity---spontaneity%1:07:00:: theory---theory%1:09:00:: and other training---training%1:04:00:: concepts---concept%1:09:00:: .
In addition , the basic approach---approach%1:04:02:: utilized in applying roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: will be reviewed .
The goal---goal%1:09:00:: will be to provide the reader---reader%1:18:00:: with an integrated rationale---rationale%1:09:00:: to aid him in applying roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: in this unique training---training%1:04:00:: area---area%1:26:00:: .
The reasons---reason%1:16:00:: for extracting this particular roleplaying---roleplaying%1:04:00:: application---application%1:04:02:: from the previous discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: of training---training%1:04:00:: are twofold :
Spontaneity---spontaneity%1:07:00:: training---training%1:04:00:: theory---theory%1:09:00:: is unique and relatively new .
In tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: and in poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: , the marriage bed---marriage_bed%1:06:00:: is a place---place%1:15:00:: of unity---unity%1:26:00:: and harmony---harmony%1:07:01:: .
The partners---partner%1:18:01:: each bring to it unselfish love---love%1:12:00:: , and each takes away an equal share---share%1:21:00:: of pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: and joy---joy%1:12:00:: .
At its most ecstatic moments---moment%1:28:00:: , husband---husband%1:18:00:: and wife---wife%1:18:00:: are elevated far above worldly cares---care%1:12:01:: .
This is the ideal---ideal%1:18:00:: .
But marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: experts---expert%1:18:00:: say that such mutual contribution---contribution%1:04:02:: and mutual joy---joy%1:12:00:: are seldom achieved .
Instead one partner---partner%1:18:01:: or the other dominates the sexual relationship---sexual_relationship%1:26:00:: .
In the past---past%1:28:00:: , it has been the husband---husband%1:18:00:: who has been dominant and the wife---wife%1:18:00:: passive .
But today---today%1:28:00:: there are signs---sign%1:10:05:: that these roles---role%1:04:01:: are being reversed .
In a growing number---number%1:07:00:: of American homes---home%1:15:04:: , marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: counselors---counselor%1:18:01:: report , the wife---wife%1:18:00:: is taking a commanding role---role%1:04:01:: in sexual relationships---sexual_relationship%1:26:00:: .
It is she who decides the time---time%1:28:06:: , the place---place%1:15:00:: , the surroundings---surroundings%1:26:00:: , and the frequency---frequency%1:28:00:: of the sexual act---act%1:03:00:: .
It is she who says aye or nay---nay%1:10:00:: to the intimate questions---question%1:10:01:: of sexual technique---technique%1:09:00:: and mechanics---mechanics%1:04:00:: - not the husband---husband%1:18:00:: .
The whole act---act%1:03:00:: is tailored to her pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: , and not to theirs .
Beyond a certain point---point%1:26:00:: , of course , no woman---woman%1:18:00:: can be dominant - nature---nature%1:18:00:: has seen to that .
But there is little doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: that in many marriages---marriage%1:14:00:: the wife---wife%1:18:00:: is boss---boss%1:18:03:: of the marital bed---bed%1:06:00:: .
Of course , there remain many `` old-fashioned '' marriages---marriage%1:14:00:: in which the husband---husband%1:18:00:: maintains his supremacy---supremacy%1:26:00:: .
Yet even in these marriages---marriage%1:14:00:: , psychologists---psychologist%1:18:00:: say , wives---wife%1:18:00:: are asserting themselves more strongly .
The meekest , most submissive wife---wife%1:18:00:: of today---today%1:28:00:: is a tiger---tiger%1:18:00:: by her mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's or grandmother---grandmother%1:18:00:: 's standards---standard%1:10:00:: .
To many experts---expert%1:18:00:: , this trend---trend%1:15:02:: was inevitable .
They consider it simply a sign---sign%1:10:05:: of our times---times%1:28:01:: .
Our society---society%1:14:00:: has `` emancipated '' the woman---woman%1:18:00:: , giving her new independence---independence%1:26:00:: and new authority---authority%1:07:00:: .
It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role---role%1:04:01:: .
`` The sexual relationship---sexual_relationship%1:26:00:: does not exist in a vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: '' , declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone---person%1:03:00:: , medical director---director%1:18:00:: of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America---group%1:03:00:: and author---author%1:18:00:: of the recent book---book%1:10:00:: , Release From Sexual Tensions .
`` It reflects what is going on in other areas---area%1:09:00:: of the marriage---marriage%1:14:00:: and in society---society%1:14:00:: itself .
A world---world%1:14:01:: in which wives---wife%1:18:00:: have taken a more active role---role%1:04:01:: is likely to produce sexual relationships---sexual_relationship%1:26:00:: in which wives---wife%1:18:00:: are more self-assertive , too '' .
Yet many psychologists---psychologist%1:18:00:: and marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: counselors---counselor%1:18:01:: agree that domination---domination%1:04:00:: of the sex---sex%1:04:00:: relationship---relationship%1:26:00:: by one partner---partner%1:18:01:: or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous .
It can , in fact , wreck a marriage---marriage%1:14:00:: .
When a husband---husband%1:18:00:: is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's desires---desire%1:07:00:: , she is cheated of the fulfillment---fulfillment%1:12:00:: and pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: nature---nature%1:18:00:: intended for her .
On the other hand , wifely supremacy---supremacy%1:26:00:: demeans the husband---husband%1:18:00:: , saps his self-respect---self-respect%1:07:00:: , and robs him of his masculinity---masculinity%1:07:00:: .
He is a target---target%1:18:00:: of ridicule---ridicule%1:10:00:: to his wife---wife%1:18:00:: , and often - since private affairs---affairs%1:09:00:: rarely remain private - to the outside world---world%1:14:01:: as well .
`` A marriage---marriage%1:14:00:: can survive almost any kind---kind%1:09:00:: of stress---stress%1:26:02:: except an open and direct challenge---challenge%1:10:00:: to the husband---husband%1:18:00:: 's maleness---maleness%1:07:00:: '' , declares Dr. Calderone---person%1:03:00:: .
This opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: is supported by one of the nation---nation%1:14:00:: 's leading psychiatrists---psychiatrist%1:18:00:: , Dr. Maurice E. Linden---person%1:03:00:: , director---director%1:18:00:: of the Mental Health Division---group%1:03:00:: of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health---group%1:03:00:: .
`` When the roles---role%1:04:01:: of husband---husband%1:18:00:: and wife---wife%1:18:00:: are reversed , so that the wife---wife%1:18:00:: becomes leader---leader%1:18:00:: and the husband---husband%1:18:00:: follower---follower%1:18:00:: '' , Dr. Linden---person%1:03:00:: says , `` the effects---effect%1:19:00:: on their whole relationship---relationship%1:26:00:: , sexual and otherwise , can be disastrous '' .
In one extreme case---case%1:11:00:: , cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist , an office worker 's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded .
In one extreme case---case%1:18:03:: , cited by a Pittsburgh---pittsburgh%1:15:00:: psychologist---psychologist%1:18:00:: , an office---office%1:06:00:: worker---worker%1:18:00:: 's wife---wife%1:18:00:: refused to have sexual relations---sexual_relation%1:04:00:: with her husband---husband%1:18:00:: unless he bought her the luxuries---luxury%1:07:00:: she demanded .
To win her favors---favor%1:04:00:: , her husband---husband%1:18:00:: first took an additional job---job%1:04:00:: , then desperately began to embezzle from his employer---employer%1:18:00:: .
Caught at last , he was sentenced to prison---prison%1:06:00:: .
While he was in custody---custody%1:26:00:: his wife---wife%1:18:00:: divorced him .
More typical is the case---case%1:11:00:: of a suburban Long Island---long_island%1:15:00:: housewife---housewife%1:18:00:: described by a marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: counselor---counselor%1:18:01:: .
This woman---woman%1:18:00:: repeatedly complained she was `` too tired '' for marital relations---relation%1:04:01:: .
To please her , her husband---husband%1:18:00:: assumed some of the domestic chores---chore%1:04:00:: .
Finally , he was cooking , washing dishes---dish%1:06:00:: , bathing---bathing%1:04:01:: the children---child%1:18:00:: , and even ironing - and still his wife---wife%1:18:00:: refused to have relations---relation%1:04:01:: as often as he desired them .
One wife---wife%1:18:00:: , described by a New York---new_york%1:15:01:: psychologist---psychologist%1:18:00:: , so dominated her husband---husband%1:18:00:: that she actually placed their sexual relationship---sexual_relationship%1:26:00:: on a schedule---schedule%1:10:00:: , writing it down right between the weekly PTA---group%1:03:00:: meetings---meeting%1:14:00:: and the Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: neighborhood---neighborhood%1:14:00:: card---card%1:06:00:: parties---party%1:14:00:: .
Another put sex---sex%1:04:00:: on a dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: and cents---cent%1:23:00:: basis---basis%1:24:00:: .
After every money---money%1:21:02:: argument---argument%1:10:03:: , she rebuffed her husband---husband%1:18:00:: 's overtures---overture%1:10:00:: until the matter---matter%1:09:01:: was settled in her favor---favor%1:07:00:: .
Experts---expert%1:18:00:: say the partners---partner%1:18:01:: in marriages---marriage%1:14:00:: like these can almost be typed .
The wife---wife%1:18:00:: is likely to be young , sophisticated , smart as a whip - often a girl---girl%1:18:00:: who has sacrificed a promising career---career%1:04:00:: for marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: .
She knows the power---power%1:07:00:: of the sex---sex%1:04:00:: urge---urge%1:16:00:: and how to use it to manipulate her husband---husband%1:18:00:: .
The husband---husband%1:18:00:: is usually a well-educated professional---professional%1:18:00:: , preoccupied with his job---job%1:04:00:: - often an organization---organization%1:04:00:: man---man%1:18:00:: whose motto---motto%1:10:00:: for getting ahead is : `` Do n't rock the boat '' .
Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: .
Hemmed in on the job---job%1:06:00:: and unable to assert himself , he uses the sex act---sex_act%1:04:00:: so he can be supreme in at least one area---area%1:09:00:: .
More often , though , he is so accustomed to submitting to authority---authority%1:07:00:: on the job---job%1:06:00:: without argument---argument%1:10:03:: that he lives by the same rule---rule%1:09:01:: at home---home%1:15:04:: .
Some psychologists---psychologist%1:18:00:: , in fact , suggest that career---career%1:04:00:: bound husbands---husband%1:18:00:: often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages---marriage%1:14:00:: than their wives---wife%1:18:00:: .
The wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: at control---control%1:26:00:: , these psychologists---psychologist%1:18:00:: contend , is sometimes merely a pathetic effort---effort%1:04:00:: to compel her husband---husband%1:18:00:: to pay as much attention---attention%1:04:02:: to her as he does to his job---job%1:04:00:: .
Naturally no woman---woman%1:18:00:: can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative---initiative%1:04:00:: .
Unless her husband---husband%1:18:00:: also desires sex---sex%1:04:00:: , the act---act%1:03:00:: cannot be consummated .
Generally , however , in such marriages---marriage%1:14:00:: as those cited , the husband---husband%1:18:00:: is at his wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's mercy---mercy%1:07:00:: .
`` The pattern---pattern%1:09:03:: '' , says Dr. Morton Schillinger---person%1:03:00:: , psychologist---psychologist%1:18:00:: at New York---new_york%1:15:01:: 's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy---group%1:03:00:: , `` is for the husband---husband%1:18:00:: to hover about anxiously and eagerly , virtually trembling in his hope---hope%1:12:01:: that she will flash him the signal---signal%1:10:00:: that tonight is the night---night%1:28:00:: '' .
No one seriously contends , of course , that the domineering wife---wife%1:18:00:: is , sexually speaking , a new character---character%1:09:01:: in our world .
After all , the henpecked husband---husband%1:18:00:: with his shrewish wife---wife%1:18:00:: is a comic figure---figure%1:07:00:: of long standing , in literature---literature%1:10:00:: and on the stage---stage%1:10:00:: , as Dr. Schillinger---person%1:03:00:: points out .
There is no evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that these Milquetoasts---milquetoast%1:18:00:: became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold---threshold%1:06:01:: of the master bedroom---master_bedroom%1:06:00:: .
Furthermore , Dr. Calderone---person%1:03:00:: says , a certain number---number%1:07:00:: of docile , retiring men---man%1:18:00:: always have been around .
They are n't `` frigid '' and they are n't homosexual ; they 're just restrained in all of life---life%1:09:00:: .
One such man---man%1:18:00:: once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik---person%1:03:00:: , New York---new_york%1:15:01:: psychiatrist---psychiatrist%1:18:00:: , that he preferred to have his wife---wife%1:18:00:: the sexual aggressor---aggressor%1:18:01:: .
`` Because that 's no activity---activity%1:04:00:: for a gentleman---gentleman%1:18:00:: '' .
But such cases---case%1:11:00:: were , in the past---past%1:28:00:: , unusual .
Society---society%1:14:00:: here and abroad has been built around the dominating male - even the Bible---bible%1:10:00:: appears to endorse the concept---concept%1:09:00:: .
Family---family%1:14:00:: survival---survival%1:26:00:: on our own Western frontier , for example , could quite literally depend on a man---man%1:18:00:: 's strength---strength%1:07:00:: and ability---ability%1:07:00:: to bring home the bacon ; and the dependent wife---wife%1:18:00:: seldom questioned his judgment---judgment%1:04:02:: about anything , including the marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: bed---bed%1:06:00:: .
This carried over into the more urbanized late 19 th and early 20 th centuries---century%1:28:00:: , when the man---man%1:18:00:: ruled the roost in the best bull roaring Life With Father manner---manner%1:07:01:: .
In those days---day%1:28:03:: , a wife---wife%1:18:00:: had mighty few rights---right%1:07:00:: in the domestic sphere---sphere%1:09:00:: and even fewer in the sexual sphere---sphere%1:09:00:: .
`` Grandma---grandma%1:18:00:: was n't expected to like it '' , Dr. Marion Hilliard---person%1:03:00:: , the late Toronto---toronto%1:15:00:: gynecologist---gynecologist%1:18:00:: , once summed up the attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of the ' 90 s .
Wives---wife%1:18:00:: of the period---period%1:28:00:: shamefacedly thought of themselves as `` used '' by their husbands---husband%1:18:00:: - and , history---history%1:28:00:: indicates , they often quite literally were .
When was the turning point---turning_point%1:11:00:: ?
When did women---woman%1:18:00:: begin to assert themselves sexually ?
Some date it from woman---woman%1:18:00:: suffrage---suffrage%1:07:00:: , others from when women---woman%1:18:00:: first began to challenge men---man%1:18:00:: in the marketplace---marketplace%1:06:00:: , still others from the era---era%1:28:00:: of the emancipated flapper---flapper%1:18:00:: and bathtub gin---bathtub_gin%1:13:00:: .
Virtually everyone agrees , however , that the trend---trend%1:09:00:: toward female sexual aggressiveness---aggressiveness%1:07:00:: was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush---rush%1:04:00:: to the suburbs---suburb%1:15:00:: .
Left alone while her husband---husband%1:18:00:: was miles---mile%1:23:01:: away in the city---city%1:15:00:: , the modern wife---wife%1:18:00:: assumed more and more duties---duty%1:04:00:: normally reserved for the male---male%1:18:00:: .
Circumstances---circumstances%1:26:02:: gave her almost undisputed sway---sway%1:07:00:: over child---child%1:18:00:: rearing---rearing%1:07:00:: , money---money%1:21:02:: handling---handling%1:04:02:: and home---home%1:06:00:: maintenance---maintenance%1:04:00:: .
She found she could cope with all kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of problems---problem%1:26:00:: for which she was once considered too helpless .
She liked this taste---taste%1:11:00:: of authority---authority%1:07:00:: and independence---independence%1:26:00:: , and , with darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: , was not likely to give it up .
`` Very few wives---wife%1:18:00:: '' , says Dr. Calderone---person%1:03:00:: , `` who balance the checkbook---checkbook%1:21:00:: , fix the car---car%1:06:00:: , choose where the family---family%1:14:00:: will live and deal with the tradesmen---tradesman%1:18:00:: , are suddenly going to become submissive where sex---sex%1:04:00:: is concerned .
A woman---woman%1:18:00:: who dominates other family---family%1:14:00:: affairs---affairs%1:09:00:: will dominate the sexual relationship---sexual_relationship%1:26:00:: as well '' .
And an additional factor---factor%1:11:00:: was helping to make women---woman%1:18:00:: more sexually self-assertive - the comparatively recent discovery---discovery%1:10:00:: of the true depths---depth%1:07:01:: of female desire---desire%1:26:00:: and response---response%1:04:01:: .
Marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: manuals---manual%1:10:00:: and women---woman%1:18:00:: 's magazine articles---magazine_article%1:10:00:: began to stress the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of the female climax---climax%1:04:00:: .
They began to describe in detail the woman---woman%1:18:00:: 's capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: for response---response%1:04:01:: .
In fact , the noted psychologist---psychologist%1:18:00:: and sex---sex%1:04:00:: researcher---researcher%1:18:00:: , Dr. Albert Ellis---person%1:03:00:: , has declared flatly that women---woman%1:18:00:: are `` sexually superior '' to men---man%1:18:00:: .
According to Dr. Ellis---person%1:03:00:: , the average 20 - year---year%1:28:01:: old American---american%1:18:00:: woman---woman%1:18:00:: is capable of far greater sexual arousal---sexual_arousal%1:26:00:: than her partner---partner%1:18:01:: .
Not surprisingly , Dr. Ellis---person%1:03:00:: says , some recently enlightened wives---wife%1:18:00:: are out to claim these capabilities---capability%1:07:00:: .
Yet , paradoxically , according to Dr. Maurice Linden---person%1:03:00:: , many wives---wife%1:18:00:: despise their husbands---husband%1:18:00:: for not standing up to them .
An aggressive woman---woman%1:18:00:: wants a man---man%1:18:00:: to demand , not knuckle under .
`` When the husband---husband%1:18:00:: becomes passive in the face of his wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's aggressiveness---aggressiveness%1:07:00:: '' , Dr. Linden---person%1:03:00:: says , `` the wife---wife%1:18:00:: , in turn , finds him inadequate .
Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction---satisfaction%1:12:00:: '' .
One such wife---wife%1:18:00:: , Dr. Linden---person%1:03:00:: says , became disgusted with her weak husband---husband%1:18:00:: and flurried through a series---series%1:14:00:: of extramarital affairs---affair%1:26:00:: in the hope---hope%1:12:01:: of finding a stronger man---man%1:18:00:: .
But her personality---personality%1:07:00:: was such that each affair---affair%1:26:00:: lasted only until that lover---lover%1:18:00:: , too , had been conquered and reduced to passivity---passivity%1:07:00:: .
Then the wife---wife%1:18:00:: bed hopped to the next on the list---list%1:10:00:: .
In some cases---case%1:11:00:: , however , domination---domination%1:26:00:: of the sex act---sex_act%1:04:00:: by one partner---partner%1:18:01:: can be temporary , triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need---need%1:26:00:: .
Thus a man---man%1:18:00:: who is butting a stone wall at the office---office%1:06:00:: may become unusually aggressive in bed---bed%1:06:00:: - the one place---place%1:15:00:: he can still be champion---champion%1:18:01:: .
If his on-the-job problems---problem%1:26:00:: work out , he may return to his old pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: .
Sometimes a burst---burst%1:04:00:: of aggressiveness---aggressiveness%1:07:00:: will sweep over a man---man%1:18:00:: - or his wife---wife%1:18:00:: - because he or she feels age---age%1:07:00:: creeping up .
On the other hand , a husband---husband%1:18:00:: who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive - asking , psychologists---psychologist%1:18:00:: say , for reassurance---reassurance%1:04:00:: that his wife---wife%1:18:00:: still finds him desirable .
Or a wife---wife%1:18:00:: may make sudden demands---demand%1:10:00:: that she be courted , flattered or coaxed , simply because she needs her ego---ego%1:12:01:: lifted .
In any case , Dr. Calderone---person%1:03:00:: remarks , such problems---problem%1:26:00:: are a couple---couple%1:14:01:: 's own affair---affair%1:09:00:: , and can n't always be measured by a general yardstick---yardstick%1:10:00:: .
`` As long as the couple---couple%1:14:01:: is in agreement in their approach---approach%1:04:02:: to sex---sex%1:04:00:: , it makes little difference---difference%1:11:00:: if one or the other dominates '' , Dr. Calderone---person%1:03:00:: declares .
`` The important point---point%1:10:01:: is that both be satisfied with the adjustment---adjustment%1:11:00:: '' .
Other experts---expert%1:18:00:: say , however , that if sexual domination---domination%1:04:00:: by one or the other partner---partner%1:18:01:: exists for longer than a brief period---period%1:28:00:: , it is likely to shake the marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: .
And just as domination---domination%1:04:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: often begins with the wife---wife%1:18:00:: , so the cure---cure%1:06:00:: generally must lie with the husband---husband%1:18:00:: .
`` To get a marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: back where it belongs '' , comments Dr. Schillinger---person%1:03:00:: of the Lincoln Institute---group%1:03:00:: , `` the husband---husband%1:18:00:: must take some very basic steps---step%1:04:02:: .
He must become more expressive of his own desires---desire%1:12:00:: , more demanding and less ' understanding '' ' .
Too many husbands---husband%1:18:00:: , Dr. Schillinger---person%1:03:00:: continues , worry about `` how well they 're doing '' , and fear that their success---success%1:11:00:: depends on some trick---trick%1:04:05:: or technique---technique%1:09:00:: of sexual play---play%1:04:04:: .
Over the rattling---rattling%1:11:00:: of fenders---fender%1:06:01:: , humming---humming%1:11:00:: of tires---tire%1:06:00:: and chattering---chattering%1:11:01:: of gears---gear%1:06:00:: there was a charming melody---melody%1:09:00:: of whispers---whisper%1:10:00:: and tiny giggles---giggle%1:10:00:: .
Cool air---air%1:19:00:: moving slowly through the open or smashed out side windows---window%1:06:01:: hinted of blooming roadside---roadside%1:06:00:: vegetation---vegetation%1:14:00:: , and occasionally a faint fragrance---fragrance%1:09:00:: of perfume---perfume%1:09:00:: swirled from the back seat---seat%1:15:01:: .
`` Moriarty---person%1:03:00:: '' , my driver---driver%1:18:00:: suddenly exclaimed with something so definite , so final in his tone---tone%1:10:01:: I once more repeated the absurdity---absurdity%1:10:00:: , mustering all my latent powers---power%1:09:01:: of hypocrisy---hypocrisy%1:07:00:: to sound convinced .
We were coming to an intersection---intersection%1:06:00:: , turning right , chuffing to a stop---stop%1:11:00:: .
Forced to realize that this was the end---end%1:15:00:: of a very short line---line%1:06:03:: I scanned a road---road%1:06:00:: marker---marker%1:06:00:: and discovered what the end---end%1:11:00:: of a slightly longer line---line%1:06:03:: would be for the old Mexican---person%1:03:00:: : Moriarty---location%1:03:00:: , New Mexico---new_mexico%1:15:00:: .
Adios---adios%1:10:00:: '' , I said , exhausting my Spanish vocabulary---vocabulary%1:09:00:: on my host---host%1:18:02:: and exchanging one of a scarcely tapped store---store%1:21:00:: of smiles---smile%1:10:00:: with my host---host%1:18:02:: 's daughters---daughter%1:18:00:: .
I waved with discretion---discretion%1:09:00:: and moderation---moderation%1:07:00:: to the vague golden faces---face%1:08:00:: fading through rising dust---dust%1:27:00:: and the distortions---distortion%1:19:00:: of the back window---window%1:06:01:: glass---glass%1:27:00:: .
Then I saw the father---father%1:18:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: slightly turn ; gauche rainbow---rainbow%1:17:00:: shapes---shape%1:07:00:: replaced the poignant ovals---oval%1:25:00:: of gold---gold%1:07:00:: .
Autos---auto%1:06:00:: whizzed past .
White shirted and conservatively cravated drivers---driver%1:18:00:: stared conspicuously toward the eastern horizon---horizon%1:15:00:: and past my supplicating and accusing gaze---gaze%1:04:00:: .
Suddenly a treble auto---auto%1:06:00:: horn---horn%1:10:02:: tootley-toot-tootled , and , thumbing hopefully , I saw emergent in windshield---windshield%1:06:00:: flash---flash%1:07:00:: : red lips---lip%1:08:00:: , streaming silk---silk%1:27:00:: of blonde hair---hair%1:08:00:: and - ah , trembling confusion---confusion%1:09:00:: of hope---hope%1:12:01:: , apprehension---apprehension%1:12:00:: , despair---despair%1:12:00:: - the leering face---face%1:08:00:: of old Herry---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Mor-ee-air-teeeee '' , he shrieked , his white teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: grossly counterpointing those of the glittering blonde---blonde%1:18:00:: .
Over the rapidly diminishing outline---outline%1:15:00:: of a jump seat---jump_seat%1:06:00:: piled high with luggage---luggage%1:06:00:: Herry---person%1:03:00:: 's black brushcut---brush_cut%1:08:00:: was just discernible , near , or enviably near that spot---spot%1:15:01:: where - hidden - more delicately textured , most beautifully tinted hair---hair%1:08:00:: must still be streaming back in cool , oh cool wind---wind%1:19:00:: sweetly perfumed with sagebrush---sagebrush%1:20:00:: and yucca---yucca%1:20:00:: flowers---flower%1:20:02:: and engine---engine%1:06:00:: fumes---fumes%1:27:00:: .
Damn his luck---luck%1:26:00:: .
I would have foregone my romantic chances---chance%1:19:00:: rather than leave a friend---friend%1:18:00:: sweltering and dusty and - Well , at least I would n't have shouted back a taunt---taunt%1:04:00:: .
Still nursing anger---anger%1:12:00:: I listlessly thumbed a car---car%1:06:00:: that was slowly approaching , its pre-war chrome---chrome%1:27:00:: nearly blinding me .
Just as I straightened up with my duffel bag---duffel_bag%1:06:00:: , I heard : `` Sahjunt Yoorick---person%1:03:00:: , meet Mrs. Major J. A. Roebuck---person%1:03:00:: '' .
The voice---voice%1:07:00:: was that of Johnson---person%1:03:00:: , tail---tail%1:28:00:: gunner---gunner%1:18:00:: off another crew---crew%1:14:01:: .
Squeezing a look---look%1:04:00:: between Johnson---person%1:03:00:: 's fat jowls---jowl%1:08:00:: and the car---car%1:06:00:: frame---frame%1:06:02:: a handsome and still darkhaired lady---lady%1:18:02:: inquired `` Y ' all drahve '' ?
`` Onleh one thiihng '' , Mrs. Roebuck---person%1:03:00:: continued .
`` Ahm goin nawth t ' jawn mah husbun---husband%1:18:00:: in Sante Fe---location%1:03:00:: , an y ' all maht prefuh the suhthuhn rewt---route%1:15:00:: .
But Corporal Johnson---person%1:03:00:: has alreadeh said it didn make no diffrunce t ' hi-im '' .
I said that it did n't make any difference---difference%1:10:00:: to me either , as far as I knew .
Let me pass over the trip---trip%1:04:00:: to Sante Fe---location%1:03:00:: with something of the same speed---speed%1:28:00:: which made Mrs. Roebuck---person%1:03:00:: `` wonduh if the wahtahm speed limit---speed_limit%1:10:00:: '' ( 35 m. p. h---mph%1:28:01:: . ) `` is still in ee-faket---effect%1:07:01:: '' .
I let up on the accelerator , only to gradually reach again the 60 m. p. h.---mph%1:28:00:: which would , I hoped , overhaul Herry and the blonde , and as there were cars whose drivers apparently had something more important to catch than had I , Mrs. Major Roebuck settled down to practicing on Corporal Johnson the kittenish wiles she would need when making her duty call on Colonel and Mrs. Somebody in Sante Fe .
I let up on the accelerator---accelerator%1:06:02:: , only to gradually reach again the 60 m. p. h.---mph%1:28:01:: which would , I hoped , overhaul Herry---person%1:03:00:: and the blonde---blonde%1:18:00:: , and as there were cars---car%1:06:00:: whose drivers---driver%1:18:00:: apparently had something more important to catch than had I , Mrs. Major Roebuck---person%1:03:00:: settled down to practicing on Corporal Johnson---person%1:03:00:: the kittenish wiles---wile%1:04:00:: she would need when making her duty---duty%1:04:00:: call---call%1:04:03:: on Colonel---colonel%1:18:00:: and Mrs. Somebody in Sante Fe---location%1:03:00:: .
When Johnson---person%1:03:00:: ejaculated `` Howsabout my buying---buying%1:04:00:: us all a nice cold Co-cola---coca_cola%1:13:00:: , Ma ' am---ma'am%1:18:00:: '' ?
Mrs. Roebuck---person%1:03:00:: smilingly declined and began suddenly to go on about her son---son%1:18:00:: , who was `` onleh a little younguh than you bawhs---boy%1:18:02:: '' .
Johnson---person%1:03:00:: never would have believed she had a son---son%1:18:00:: that age---age%1:28:00:: .
Mrs. Roebuck---person%1:03:00:: thought Johnson---person%1:03:00:: was a `` sweet bawh---boy%1:18:02:: t ' lah lahk thet '' , but her Herman---person%1:03:00:: was getting to be a man---man%1:18:00:: , there was no getting around it .
`` Just befoh he left foh his academeh---academy%1:14:00:: we wuh hevin dack-rihs---daiquiri%1:13:00:: on the vuhranduh---veranda%1:06:00:: , Major Roebuck---person%1:03:00:: an Ah , an Huhmun---person%1:03:00:: says ' May Ah hev one---one%1:23:00:: too ' ?
an Ah coudn ansuh him an so Ah said ' Aw right , Ah gay-ess , an his fathuh---father%1:18:00:: did n uttuh one wohd---word%1:10:03:: an aftuh Huhmun---person%1:03:00:: was gone , the majuh---major%1:18:00:: laughed an tole me thet he an the bawh---boy%1:18:03:: had been hevin an occasional drink---drink%1:04:00:: t ' gethuh f ' ovuh a yeah---year%1:28:01:: , onleh an occasional one---one%1:23:00:: , but just the same it was behahn mah back---back%1:08:00:: , an Ah doa n think thet 's nahce at all , d ' you '' ?
`` No---no%1:10:00:: , I do n't '' , Johnson---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` I 'm a good Baptist---baptist%1:18:00:: , and drinking---drinking%1:04:00:: & & & '' .
Mrs. Roebuck---person%1:03:00:: very kindly let me drive through Sante Fe to a road---road%1:06:00:: which would , she said , lead us to Taos---location%1:03:00:: and then Raton---location%1:03:00:: and `` eventshahleh '' out of New Mexico---new_mexico%1:15:00:: .
How lightly her `` eventshah-leh '' passed into the crannies where I was storing dialect---dialect%1:10:00:: material---material%1:10:00:: for some vaguely dreamed opus---opus%1:10:00:: , and how the word---word%1:10:00:: would echo .
Hardly had Mrs. Roebuck---person%1:03:00:: driven off when a rusty pick-up---pickup%1:06:00:: truck---truck%1:06:00:: , father---father%1:18:00:: or grandfather---grandfather%1:18:00:: of Senor `` Moriarty---person%1:03:00:: 's '' Ford sedan---sedan%1:06:00:: , came screeching to a dust---dust%1:27:00:: swirling stop---stop%1:11:00:: , and a brown face---face%1:08:00:: appeared , its nose---nose%1:08:00:: threatened by shards---shard%1:06:00:: of what had once been the side window---window%1:06:01:: .
`` Get in , buddies---buddy%1:18:00:: .
The straight , black hair---hair%1:08:00:: flopped in a vigorous nod---nod%1:04:00:: , the slender nose---nose%1:08:00:: plunged toward glass---glass%1:27:00:: teeth---tooth%1:06:01:: and drew safely back .
Johnson---person%1:03:00:: unwired the right hand door---door%1:06:00:: , whose window---window%1:06:00:: was , like the left one , merely loosely taped fragments---fragment%1:06:00:: of glass---glass%1:27:00:: , and Johnson---person%1:03:00:: wadded himself into a narrow seat---seat%1:15:01:: made still more narrow by three cases---case%1:06:00:: of beer---beer%1:13:00:: .
Johnson unwired the right hand door , whose window was , like the left one , merely loosely taped fragments of glass , and Johnson wadded himself into a narrow seat made still more narrow by three cases---case%1:23:00:: of beer .
`` In back---back%1:06:00:: , buddy---buddy%1:18:00:: '' , the driver---driver%1:18:00:: said to me .
Quickly but carefully lowering my duffel bag---duffel_bag%1:06:00:: over the low side rack---rack%1:06:01:: , I stepped on the running board---running_board%1:06:00:: ; it flopped down , sprang back up and gouged my shin---shin%1:08:01:: .
The truck---truck%1:06:00:: was hurtling forward .
I seized the rack---rack%1:06:01:: and made a western style---style%1:07:00:: flying mount---mount%1:04:00:: just in time , one of my knees---knee%1:08:00:: mercifully landing on my duffel bag---duffel_bag%1:06:00:: - and merely wrecking my camera---camera%1:06:00:: , I was to discover later - my other knee---knee%1:08:00:: landing on the slivery truck---truck%1:06:00:: floor boards---floor_board%1:06:00:: and - but this is no medical report---medical_report%1:10:00:: .
I was again in motion---motion%1:11:00:: and at a speed---speed%1:28:00:: which belied the truck---truck%1:06:00:: 's similarity---similarity%1:07:00:: to Senor X---person%1:03:00:: 's Ford turtle .
Maybe I would beat old Herry---person%1:03:00:: to Siberia---siberia%1:15:00:: after all .
Whatever satisfaction---satisfaction%1:26:00:: that might offer .
Something pulled my leg---leg%1:08:01:: .
I drew back , drawing back my foot---foot%1:08:01:: for a kick---kick%1:04:00:: .
But it was only Johnson---person%1:03:00:: reaching around the wire---wire%1:06:00:: chicken---chicken%1:05:01:: fencing---fencing%1:06:00:: , which half covered the truck---truck%1:06:00:: cab---cab%1:06:02:: 's glassless rear window---rear_window%1:06:00:: .
The way---way%1:07:01:: his red rubber lips---lip%1:08:00:: were stretched across his pearly little teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: I though he was only having a little joke---joke%1:04:01:: , but , no---no%1:10:00:: , he wanted me to bend down from the roar---roar%1:11:00:: of wind---wind%1:19:00:: so he could roar something into my ear---ear%1:08:00:: .
`` Wanna beer---beer%1:13:00:: '' ?
`` Hell , yes---yes%1:10:00:: '' , I roared back between dusty lips---lip%1:08:00:: .
Did I want a beer---beer%1:13:00:: ?
Did an anteater---anteater%1:05:04:: want ants---ant%1:05:00:: ?
Gracias '' , I hollered , my first long swallow---swallow%1:13:00:: filling me with confidence---confidence%1:09:00:: and immediately doubling the size---size%1:07:00:: of my Spanish vocabulary---vocabulary%1:09:00:: .
At once my ears---ear%1:08:00:: were drowned by a flow---flow%1:26:00:: of what I took to be Spanish---spanish%1:10:00:: , but - the driver---driver%1:18:00:: 's white teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: flashing at me , the road---road%1:06:00:: wildly veering beyond his glistening hair---hair%1:08:00:: , beyond his gesticulating bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: - it could have been the purest Oxford English---oxford_english%1:10:00:: I was half hearing ; I would n't have known the difference---difference%1:07:00:: .
Johnson---person%1:03:00:: was trying to grab the wheel---wheel%1:06:05:: , though the swerve---swerve%1:04:00:: of the truck---truck%1:06:00:: was throwing him away from it .
White teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: suddenly vanishing , the driver---driver%1:18:00:: slammed the side---side%1:06:00:: of his bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: against Johnson---person%1:03:00:: 's ear---ear%1:08:00:: .
We were off the road---road%1:06:00:: , gleaming barbed wire---barbed_wire%1:06:00:: pulling taut .
I ducked just as the first strand---strand%1:06:02:: broke somewhere down the line---line%1:06:00:: and came whipping over the sideboards---sideboard%1:06:02:: .
We were in a field---field%1:15:00:: , in a tight , screeching turn---turn%1:04:01:: .
Prairie dogs---prairie_dog%1:05:00:: were popping up and popping down .
When I fell on my back---back%1:08:00:: , I saw a vulture---vulture%1:05:00:: hovering .
Just as I got to my knees---knee%1:08:00:: , there was again the sound---sound%1:07:00:: of the fence---fence%1:06:00:: stretching , and I had time---time%1:28:05:: only to start taking my kneeling posture---posture%1:07:00:: seriously .
This time---time%1:11:00:: no wire---wire%1:06:00:: came whipping into the truck---truck%1:06:00:: .
We were back on the road---road%1:06:00:: .
I regained my squatting---squatting%1:04:00:: position---position%1:07:01:: behind the truck---truck%1:06:00:: cab---cab%1:06:02:: 's rear window---rear_window%1:06:00:: .
Johnson---person%1:03:00:: 's left hand---left_hand%1:08:00:: was pressed against the side---side%1:15:00:: of his head---head%1:08:00:: , red cheeks---cheek%1:08:00:: whitening beneath his fingers---finger%1:08:00:: .
`` Tee-wah '' , the driver---driver%1:18:00:: cackled , his black eyes---eye%1:08:00:: glittering behind dull silver chicken---chicken%1:05:01:: fencing---fencing%1:06:00:: .
You thought I was a Mexican---mexican%1:18:00:: , did n't you , buddy---buddy%1:18:00:: '' ?
`` Hell , that 's all right , buddy---buddy%1:18:00:: '' , the Indian---indian%1:18:00:: ( I now guessed ) said .
`` Drink your beer---beer%1:13:00:: '' .
Miraculously , the bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: was still in my hand---hand%1:08:00:: , foam---foam%1:17:00:: still geysering over my ( luckily ) waterproof watch---watch%1:06:00:: .
No sooner had I started drinking than the driver---driver%1:18:00:: started zigzagging the truck---truck%1:06:00:: .
The beer---beer%1:13:00:: foamed furiously .
A long time---time%1:28:05:: .
Emptied the bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: .
Teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: again flashing back at me , the driver---driver%1:18:00:: released a deluge---deluge%1:23:00:: of Spanish---spanish%1:10:00:: in which `` amigo '' appeared every so often like an island---island%1:17:00:: in the stormy waves---wave%1:04:02:: of surrounding sound---sound%1:07:00:: .
Teeth again flashing back at me , the driver released a deluge of Spanish in which `` amigo '' appeared every so often like an island in the stormy waves---wave%1:11:01:: of surrounding sound .
I bobbed my head---head%1:08:00:: each time---time%1:11:00:: it appeared .
Suddenly the Spanish---spanish%1:10:00:: became an English---english%1:10:00:: in which only one word---word%1:10:00:: emerged with clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: and precision---precision%1:07:00:: , `` son of a bitch---son_of_a_bitch%1:18:00:: '' , sometimes hyphenated by vicious jabs---jab%1:04:01:: of a beer bottle---beer_bottle%1:06:00:: into Johnson---person%1:03:00:: 's quivering ribs---rib%1:08:01:: .
A big car---car%1:06:00:: was approaching , its chrome---chrome%1:27:00:: teeth---tooth%1:06:01:: grinning .
Beyond it the gray road---road%1:06:00:: stretched a long , long way---way%1:07:02:: .
The car---car%1:06:00:: was just about to us , its driver---driver%1:18:00:: 's fat , solemn face---face%1:08:00:: intent on the road---road%1:06:00:: ahead , on business---business%1:09:01:: , on a family---family%1:14:00:: in Sante Fe---location%1:03:00:: - on anything but an old pick-up---pickup%1:06:00:: truck in which two human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: desperately needed rescue---rescue%1:04:00:: .
I tossed the bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: .
High , so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car---car%1:06:00:: 's steel---steel%1:27:00:: roof---roof%1:06:01:: .
On unoccupied roadway---roadway%1:06:00:: the bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: shattered into a small amber flash---flash%1:07:00:: .
The Indian---indian%1:18:00:: was again raising his bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: , but to my astonished relief---relief%1:12:00:: - probably only a fraction---fraction%1:06:00:: of Johnson---person%1:03:00:: 's - the bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: this time---time%1:11:00:: went to the Indian---indian%1:18:00:: 's lips---lip%1:08:00:: .
Another car---car%1:06:00:: was coming , a tiny , dark shape---shape%1:07:00:: on a far hill---hill%1:17:00:: .
I started looking on the splintery truck bed---truck_bed%1:06:00:: for a piece---piece%1:17:00:: of board---board%1:27:00:: , a dirt---dirt%1:27:01:: clod---clod%1:14:00:: - anything I could throw and with better aim---aim%1:04:00:: than I had thrown the beer bottle---beer_bottle%1:06:00:: .
I started looking on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board---board%1:06:00:: , a dirt clod - anything I could throw and with better aim than I had thrown the beer bottle .
In the ditch---ditch%1:06:00:: sand---sand%1:27:00:: was white and soft looking , only an occasional pebble---pebble%1:17:00:: discernible , faintly gleaming .
But Johnson---person%1:03:00:: could n't quickly unwire the truck---truck%1:06:00:: door , and if I escaped , he might suffer .
The car---car%1:06:00:: was approaching fast .
On the truck bed---truck_bed%1:06:00:: there was nothing smaller than a piece---piece%1:06:05:: of rusty machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: ; with more time---time%1:28:05:: I could have loosened a small burr---burr%1:06:00:: or cotter pin---cotter_pin%1:06:00:: -
Suddenly and not a second---second%1:28:01:: too soon I thought of the coins---coin%1:21:02:: in my pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: .
There was no time---time%1:28:05:: to pick out a penny---penny%1:21:00:: ; I got a coin---coin%1:21:02:: between my thumb---thumb%1:08:00:: and forefinger---forefinger%1:08:00:: , leaned my elbows---elbow%1:08:00:: in a very natural and casual manner---manner%1:07:02:: on top---top%1:15:01:: of the truck---truck%1:06:00:: cab---cab%1:06:02:: and flipped my little missile---missile%1:06:00:: .
There was a blur---blur%1:09:00:: just under my focus---focus%1:07:01:: of vision---vision%1:09:02:: , a crash---crash%1:11:00:: ; the car---car%1:06:00:: 's far windshield---windshield%1:06:00:: panel---panel%1:06:00:: turned into a silver web---web%1:17:00:: with a dark hole---hole%1:17:01:: in the center---center%1:15:01:: .
There was a blur just under my focus of vision , a crash---crash%1:11:01:: ; the car 's far windshield panel turned into a silver web with a dark hole in the center .
I heard the screech---screech%1:11:00:: of brakes---brakes%1:06:00:: behind me , an insane burst---burst%1:04:02:: of laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: beneath me .
Looking back I saw a gray-haired man---man%1:18:00:: getting out of his halted car---car%1:06:00:: and trying to read our license number---license_number%1:10:00:: .
`` S-s-sahjunt---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Johnson---person%1:03:00:: 's fat hand---hand%1:08:00:: , another bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: were protruding from the truck---truck%1:06:00:: cab---cab%1:06:02:: , and that self proclaimed Baptist teetotaler---teetotaler%1:18:00:: , had a bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: at his own lips---lip%1:08:00:: .
Two cars---car%1:06:00:: came over a crest---crest%1:15:00:: , their chrome---chrome%1:27:00:: and glass---glass%1:27:00:: flashing .
The Indian---indian%1:18:00:: 's arm---arm%1:08:00:: whipped sidewise - there was a flash---flash%1:07:00:: of amber---amber%1:07:00:: and froth---froth%1:17:00:: , the crash---crash%1:04:00:: of the bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: shattering against the side---side%1:15:00:: of the first car---car%1:06:00:: .
Brakes---brakes%1:06:00:: shrieked behind us .
I saw Johnson---person%1:03:00:: 's bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: snatched from his hand---hand%1:08:00:: , saw it go in a swirl---swirl%1:25:00:: of foam---foam%1:17:00:: just behind the second car---car%1:06:00:: .
This time---time%1:11:00:: there was no sound---sound%1:07:00:: of brakes---brakes%1:06:00:: but the shrieking---shrieking%1:10:00:: of women---woman%1:18:00:: .
I looked back at pale ovals---oval%1:25:00:: framed in the elongated oval---oval%1:25:00:: of the car---car%1:06:00:: 's rear window---rear_window%1:06:00:: .
`` Drink , you son of a bitch---son_of_a_bitch%1:18:00:: '' !
But the Indian---indian%1:18:00:: was jabbing another bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: toward Johnson---person%1:03:00:: .
A tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: may be started by a sea bottom---sea_bottom%1:17:00:: slide---slide%1:11:00:: , an earthquake---earthquake%1:11:00:: or a volcanic eruption---volcanic_eruption%1:11:00:: .
The most infamous of all was launched by the explosion---explosion%1:04:00:: of the island---island%1:17:00:: of Krakatoa---location%1:03:00:: in 1883 ; it raced across the Pacific---pacific%1:17:00:: at 300 miles---mile%1:23:01:: an hour---hour%1:28:00:: , devastated the coasts---coast%1:17:00:: of Java---java%1:15:00:: and Sumatra---sumatra%1:15:00:: with waves---wave%1:11:01:: 100 to 130 feet---foot%1:23:00:: high , and pounded the shore---shore%1:17:00:: as far away as San Francisco---san_francisco%1:15:00:: .
The ancient Greeks---greek%1:18:00:: recorded several catastrophic inundations---inundation%1:19:00:: by huge waves---wave%1:11:01:: .
Whether or not Plato---plato%1:18:00:: 's tale---tale%1:10:00:: of the lost continent---continent%1:17:00:: of Atlantis---location%1:03:00:: is true , skeptics---skeptic%1:18:00:: concede that the myth---myth%1:10:00:: may have some foundation---foundation%1:24:00:: in a great tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: of ancient times---time%1:28:00:: .
Indeed , a tremendously destructive tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: that arose in the Arabian Sea---arabian_sea%1:17:00:: in 1945 has even revived the interest---interest%1:09:00:: of geologists---geologist%1:18:00:: and archaeologists---archaeologist%1:18:00:: in the Biblical story---story%1:10:03:: of the Flood .
One of the most damaging tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: on record---record%1:10:03:: followed the famous Lisbon---lisbon%1:15:00:: earthquake---earthquake%1:11:00:: of November---november%1:28:00:: 1 , 1755 ; its waves---wave%1:11:01:: persisted for a week---week%1:28:00:: and were felt as far away as the English coast---coast%1:17:00:: .
Tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: are rare , however , in the Atlantic Ocean---atlantic_ocean%1:17:00:: ; they are far more common in the Pacific---pacific%1:17:00:: .
Japan---japan%1:15:01:: has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596 .
The Hawaiian Islands---hawaiian_islands%1:15:00:: are struck severely an average---average%1:09:00:: of once every 25 years---year%1:28:01:: .
In 1707 an earthquake---earthquake%1:11:00:: in Japan---japan%1:15:01:: generated waves---wave%1:11:01:: so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea---location%1:03:00:: ; one wave---wave%1:11:01:: swamped more than 1000 ships---ship%1:06:00:: and boats---boat%1:06:00:: in Osaka Bay---location%1:03:00:: .
A tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: in the Hawaiian Islands---hawaiian_islands%1:15:00:: in 1869 washed away an entire town---town%1:15:00:: ( Ponoluu---location%1:03:00:: ) , leaving only two forlorn trees---tree%1:20:00:: standing where the community---community%1:14:00:: had been .
In 1896 a Japanese tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: killed 27000 people---people%1:14:00:: and swept away 10000 homes---home%1:06:00:: .
The dimensions---dimension%1:07:00:: of these waves---wave%1:11:01:: dwarf all our usual standards of measurement---standard_of_measurement%1:24:00:: .
An ordinary sea wave---wave%1:11:01:: is rarely more than a few hundred feet---foot%1:23:00:: long from crest---crest%1:15:00:: to crest---crest%1:15:00:: - no longer than 320 feet---foot%1:23:00:: in the Atlantic---atlantic%1:17:00:: or 1000 feet---foot%1:23:00:: in the Pacific---pacific%1:17:00:: .
But a tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: often extends more than 100 miles---mile%1:23:01:: and sometimes as much as 600 miles---mile%1:23:01:: from crest---crest%1:15:00:: to crest---crest%1:15:00:: .
While a wind---wind%1:19:00:: wave---wave%1:11:01:: never travels at more than 60 miles per hour---miles_per_hour%1:28:01:: , the velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: of a tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: in the open sea---sea%1:17:00:: must be reckoned in hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of miles per hour---miles_per_hour%1:28:01:: .
The greater the depth---depth%1:07:00:: of the water---water%1:17:00:: , the greater is the speed---speed%1:28:00:: of the wave---wave%1:11:01:: ; Lagrange---person%1:03:00:: 's law---law%1:09:01:: says that its velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: is equal to the square root---square_root%1:23:00:: of the product---product%1:09:00:: of the depth---depth%1:07:00:: times the acceleration---acceleration%1:28:00:: due to gravity---gravity%1:19:00:: .
In the deep waters---water%1:17:00:: of the Pacific---pacific%1:17:00:: these waves---wave%1:11:01:: reach a speed---speed%1:28:00:: of 500 miles per hour---miles_per_hour%1:28:01:: .
Tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: are so shallow in comparison---comparison%1:24:00:: with their length---length%1:07:00:: that in the open ocean---ocean%1:17:00:: they are hardly detectable .
Their amplitude---amplitude%1:11:00:: sometimes is as little as two feet---foot%1:23:00:: from trough---trough%1:17:00:: to crest---crest%1:15:00:: .
Usually it is only when they approach shallow water---water%1:17:00:: on the shore---shore%1:17:00:: that they build up to their terrifying heights---height%1:07:00:: .
On the fateful day---day%1:28:03:: in 1896 when the great waves---wave%1:11:01:: approached Japan---japan%1:15:01:: , fishermen---fisherman%1:18:00:: at sea noticed no unusual swells---swell%1:11:00:: .
Not until they sailed home at the end---end%1:28:00:: of the day---day%1:28:00:: , through a sea---sea%1:17:00:: strewn with bodies---body%1:08:02:: and the wreckage---wreckage%1:06:00:: of houses---house%1:06:00:: , were they aware of what had happened .
The seemingly quiet ocean---ocean%1:17:00:: had crashed a wall---wall%1:17:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: from 10 to 100 feet---foot%1:23:00:: high upon beaches---beach%1:17:00:: crowded with bathers---bather%1:18:00:: , drowning thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of them and flattening villages---village%1:15:00:: along the shore---shore%1:17:00:: .
The giant waves---wave%1:11:01:: are more dangerous on flat shores---shore%1:17:00:: than on steep ones .
They usually range from 20 to 60 feet---foot%1:23:00:: in height , but when they pour into a V shaped inlet---inlet%1:17:00:: or harbor---harbor%1:15:00:: they may rise to mountainous proportions---proportion%1:07:00:: .
Generally the first salvo---salvo%1:11:00:: of a tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: is a rather sharp swell---swell%1:11:00:: , not different enough from an ordinary wave---wave%1:11:01:: to alarm casual observers---observer%1:18:00:: .
This is followed by a tremendous suck---suck%1:04:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: away from the shore---shore%1:17:00:: as the first great trough---trough%1:17:00:: arrives .
Reefs---reef%1:17:00:: are left high and dry , and the beaches---beach%1:17:00:: are covered with stranded fish---fish%1:05:00:: .
At Hilo---location%1:03:00:: large numbers---large_number%1:23:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle---spectacle%1:10:00:: of the denuded beach---beach%1:17:00:: .
Many of them paid for their curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: with their lives---life%1:26:00:: , for some minutes---minute%1:28:00:: later the first giant wave---wave%1:11:01:: roared over the shore---shore%1:17:00:: .
After an earthquake---earthquake%1:11:00:: in Japan---japan%1:15:01:: in 1793 people---people%1:14:00:: on the coast---coast%1:17:00:: at Tugaru---location%1:03:00:: were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing---ebbing%1:22:00:: of the sea---sea%1:17:00:: that they scurried to higher ground---ground%1:17:00:: .
When a second quake---quake%1:11:00:: came , they dashed back to the beach---beach%1:17:00:: , fearing that they might be buried under landslides---landslide%1:11:00:: .
Just as they reached the shore---shore%1:17:00:: , the first huge wave---wave%1:11:01:: crashed upon them .
A tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: is not a single wave---wave%1:11:01:: but a series---series%1:14:00:: .
The waves---wave%1:11:01:: are separated by intervals---interval%1:28:00:: of 15 minutes---15_minutes%1:28:00:: to an hour---hour%1:28:00:: or more ( because of their great length---length%1:07:00:: ) , and this has often lulled people---people%1:14:00:: into thinking after the first great wave---wave%1:11:01:: has crashed that it is all over .
The waves---wave%1:11:01:: may keep coming for many hours---hour%1:28:00:: .
Usually the third to the eighth waves---wave%1:11:01:: in the series---series%1:14:00:: are the biggest .
Among the observers---observer%1:18:00:: of the 1946 tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: at Hilo---location%1:03:00:: was Francis P. Shepard---person%1:03:00:: of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography---group%1:03:00:: , one---one%1:23:00:: of the world 's foremost marine geologists---geologist%1:18:00:: .
He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves---wave%1:11:01:: .
Their onrush---onrush%1:04:00:: and retreat---retreat%1:04:00:: , he reported , was accompanied by a great hissing---hissing%1:11:00:: , roaring---roaring%1:11:00:: and rattling---rattling%1:11:00:: .
The third and fourth waves---wave%1:11:01:: seemed to be the highest .
On some of the islands---island%1:17:00:: ' beaches---beach%1:17:00:: the waves---wave%1:11:01:: came in gently ; they were steepest on the shores---shore%1:17:00:: facing the direction---direction%1:15:00:: of the seaquake---seaquake%1:11:00:: from which the waves---wave%1:11:01:: had come .
In Hilo Bay---location%1:03:00:: they were from 21 to 26 feet---foot%1:23:00:: high .
The highest waves---wave%1:11:01:: , 55 feet---foot%1:23:00:: , occurred at Pololu Valley---location%1:03:00:: .
Scientists---scientist%1:18:00:: and fishermen---fisherman%1:18:00:: have occasionally seen strange by-products---by-product%1:19:00:: of the phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: .
During a 1933 tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: in Japan---japan%1:15:01:: the sea---sea%1:17:00:: glowed brilliantly at night---night%1:28:00:: .
The luminosity---luminosity%1:07:00:: of the water---water%1:17:00:: is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation---stimulation%1:04:00:: of vast numbers---number%1:07:00:: of the luminescent organism---organism%1:03:00:: Noctiluca miliaris---noctiluca_miliaris%1:05:00:: by the turbulence---turbulence%1:19:00:: of the sea---sea%1:17:00:: .
Japanese fishermen---fisherman%1:18:00:: have sometimes observed that sardines---sardine%1:05:01:: hauled up in their nets---net%1:06:02:: during a tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: have enormously swollen stomachs---stomach%1:08:00:: ; the fish---fish%1:05:00:: have swallowed vast numbers---number%1:07:00:: of bottom---bottom%1:17:00:: living diatoms---diatom%1:05:00:: , raised to the surface---surface%1:15:00:: by the disturbance---disturbance%1:04:00:: .
The waves---wave%1:11:01:: of a 1923 tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: in Sagami Bay---location%1:03:00:: brought to the surface---surface%1:15:00:: and battered to death---death%1:28:01:: huge numbers---number%1:07:00:: of fishes---fish%1:05:00:: that normally live at a depth---depth%1:07:00:: of 3000 feet---foot%1:23:00:: .
Gratified fishermen---fisherman%1:18:00:: hauled them in by the thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: .
The tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: warning---warning%1:10:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: developed since the 1946 disaster---disaster%1:11:00:: in Hawaii---hawaii%1:15:01:: relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: devised by Commander C. K. Green---person%1:03:00:: of the Coast and Geodetic Survey---group%1:03:00:: staff---staff%1:14:01:: .
It consists of a series---series%1:14:00:: of pipes---pipe%1:06:00:: and a pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: measuring---measuring%1:04:00:: chamber---chamber%1:06:00:: which record the rise---rise%1:04:00:: and fall---fall%1:11:04:: of the water---water%1:17:00:: surface---surface%1:15:00:: .
Ordinary water---water%1:17:00:: tides---tide%1:11:00:: are disregarded .
But when waves---wave%1:11:01:: with a period---period%1:28:02:: of between 10 and 40 minutes---minute%1:28:00:: begin to roll over the ocean---ocean%1:17:00:: , they set in motion a corresponding oscillation---oscillation%1:11:00:: in a column---column%1:25:02:: of mercury---mercury%1:27:00:: which closes an electric circuit---electric_circuit%1:06:00:: .
This in turn sets off an alarm---alarm%1:06:00:: , notifying the observers---observer%1:18:00:: at the station---station%1:06:00:: that a tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: is in progress---progress%1:04:00:: .
Such equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: has been installed at Hilo---location%1:03:00:: , Midway---location%1:03:00:: , Attu---location%1:03:00:: and Dutch Harbor---location%1:03:00:: .
The moment---moment%1:28:00:: the alarm---alarm%1:06:00:: goes off , information---information%1:10:00:: is immediately forwarded to Honolulu---honolulu%1:15:00:: , which is the center---center%1:06:00:: of the warning---warning%1:10:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: .
This center---center%1:06:00:: also receives prompt reports---report%1:10:01:: on earthquakes---earthquake%1:11:00:: from four Coast Survey---group%1:03:00:: stations---station%1:06:00:: in the Pacific---pacific%1:17:00:: which are equipped with seismographs---seismograph%1:06:00:: .
Its staff---staff%1:14:01:: makes a preliminary determination---determination%1:04:00:: of the epicenter---epicenter%1:15:00:: of the quake---quake%1:11:00:: and alerts tide---tide%1:11:00:: stations---station%1:06:00:: near the epicenter---epicenter%1:15:00:: for a tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: .
By means---means%1:04:00:: of charts---chart%1:06:00:: showing wave---wave%1:11:01:: travel---travel%1:11:00:: times---time%1:28:05:: and depths---depth%1:07:00:: in the ocean---ocean%1:17:00:: at various locations---location%1:03:00:: , it is possible to estimate the rate---rate%1:28:00:: of approach---approach%1:04:00:: and probable time of arrival---time_of_arrival%1:28:00:: at Hawaii---hawaii%1:15:01:: of a tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: getting under way at any spot---spot%1:15:01:: in the Pacific---pacific%1:17:00:: .
The civil and military authorities---authority%1:14:00:: are then advised of the danger---danger%1:26:00:: , and they issue warnings---warning%1:10:00:: and take all necessary protective steps---step%1:04:02:: .
All of these activities---activity%1:04:00:: are geared to a top priority---priority%1:26:00:: communication system---communication_system%1:06:01:: , and practice---practice%1:04:02:: tests---test%1:04:00:: have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly .
Since the 1946 disaster---disaster%1:11:00:: there have been 15 tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: in the Pacific---pacific%1:17:00:: , but only one---one%1:23:00:: was of any consequence---consequence%1:07:00:: .
On November---november%1:28:00:: 4 , 1952 , an earthquake---earthquake%1:11:00:: occurred under the sea---sea%1:17:00:: off the Kamchatka Peninsula---kamchatka_peninsula%1:15:00:: .
At 17 : 07 that afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: ( Greenwich time---greenwich_time%1:28:00:: ) the shock---shock%1:11:00:: was recorded by the seismograph---seismograph%1:06:00:: alarm---alarm%1:06:00:: in Honolulu---honolulu%1:15:00:: .
The warning---warning%1:10:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: immediately went into action---action%1:26:00:: .
Within about an hour---hour%1:28:00:: with the help---help%1:04:00:: of reports---report%1:10:01:: from seismic stations---station%1:06:00:: in Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: , Arizona---arizona%1:15:00:: and California---california%1:15:00:: , the quake---quake%1:11:00:: 's epicenter---epicenter%1:15:00:: was placed at 51 degrees---degree%1:23:00:: North---north%1:24:00:: latitude---latitude%1:15:00:: and 158 degrees---degree%1:23:00:: East---east%1:24:00:: longitude---longitude%1:15:00:: .
While accounts---account%1:10:03:: of the progress---progress%1:11:00:: of the tsunami---tsunami%1:11:00:: came in from various points---point%1:15:00:: in the Pacific---pacific%1:17:00:: ( Midway---location%1:03:00:: reported it was covered with nine feet---foot%1:23:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: ) , the Hawaiian---hawaiian%1:10:00:: station---station%1:06:00:: made its calculations---calculation%1:04:00:: and notified the military services---military_service%1:14:00:: and the police---police%1:14:00:: that the first big wave---wave%1:11:01:: would arrive at Honolulu---honolulu%1:15:00:: at 23 : 30 Greenwich time---greenwich_time%1:28:00:: .
It turned out that the waves---wave%1:11:01:: were not so high as in 1946 .
They hurled a cement---cement%1:27:00:: barge---barge%1:06:00:: against a freighter---freighter%1:06:00:: in Honolulu Harbor---location%1:03:00:: , knocked down telephone lines---telephone_line%1:06:01:: , marooned automobiles---automobile%1:06:00:: , flooded lawns---lawn%1:15:00:: , killed six cows---cows%1:05:00:: .
But not a single human life---life%1:18:00:: was lost , and property---property%1:21:00:: damage---damage%1:11:00:: in the Hawaiian Islands---hawaiian_islands%1:15:00:: did not exceed $ 800000 .
There is little doubt---doubt%1:07:00:: that the warning---warning%1:10:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: saved lives---life%1:18:00:: and reduced the damage---damage%1:11:00:: .
But it is plain that a warning---warning%1:10:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: , however efficient , is not enough .
In the vulnerable areas---area%1:15:01:: of the Pacific---pacific%1:17:00:: there should be restrictions---restriction%1:09:00:: against building homes---home%1:06:00:: on exposed coasts---coast%1:17:00:: , or at least a requirement---requirement%1:09:00:: that they be either raised off the ground---ground%1:17:00:: or anchored strongly against waves---wave%1:11:01:: .
The key---key%1:09:00:: to the world---world%1:17:02:: of geology---geology%1:09:00:: is change---change%1:24:00:: ; nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: remains the same .
Life---life%1:03:00:: has evolved from simple combinations---combination%1:14:00:: of molecules---molecule%1:27:00:: in the sea---sea%1:17:00:: to complex combinations---combination%1:14:00:: in man---man%1:05:01:: .
The land---land%1:17:00:: , too , is changing , and earthquakes---earthquake%1:11:00:: are daily reminders---reminder%1:09:00:: of this .
Earthquakes---earthquake%1:11:00:: result when movements---movement%1:11:00:: in the earth---earth%1:17:01:: twist rocks---rock%1:17:01:: until they break .
Sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts---shift%1:04:00:: of the ground---ground%1:17:00:: surface---surface%1:17:00:: ; often the shifts---shift%1:04:00:: cannot be seen , but they are there ; and everywhere can be found scars---scar%1:07:00:: of earlier breaks---break%1:17:00:: once deeply buried .
Today---today%1:28:00:: 's earthquakes---earthquake%1:11:00:: are most numerous in belts---belt%1:15:00:: where the earth---earth%1:17:01:: 's restlessness---restlessness%1:07:01:: is presently concentrated , but scars---scar%1:07:00:: of the past---past%1:28:00:: show that there is no part---part%1:15:00:: of the earth---earth%1:17:01:: that has not had them .
The effects---effect%1:19:00:: of earthquakes---earthquake%1:11:00:: on civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: have been widely publicized , even overemphasized .
The role---role%1:04:00:: of an earthquake---earthquake%1:11:00:: in starting the destruction---destruction%1:04:00:: of whole cities---city%1:15:00:: is tremendously frightening , but fire---fire%1:11:00:: may actually be the principal agent---agent%1:17:00:: in a particular disaster---disaster%1:11:00:: .
Superstition---superstition%1:09:00:: has often blended with fact---fact%1:09:01:: to color reports---report%1:10:01:: .
We have learned from earthquakes---earthquake%1:11:00:: much of what we now know about the earth---earth%1:17:01:: 's interior---interior%1:15:01:: , for they send waves---wave%1:11:00:: through the earth---earth%1:17:01:: which emerge with information---information%1:10:00:: about the materials---material%1:27:00:: through which they have traveled .
These waves---wave%1:11:00:: have shown that 1800 miles---mile%1:23:01:: below the surface---surface%1:17:00:: a liquid core---core%1:17:00:: begins , and that it , in turn , has a solid inner core---core%1:17:00:: .
Earthquakes---earthquake%1:11:00:: originate as far as 400 miles---mile%1:23:01:: below the surface---surface%1:17:00:: , but they do not occur at greater depths---depth%1:07:00:: .
Two unsolved mysteries---mystery%1:09:00:: are based on these facts---fact%1:10:01:: .
( 1 ) As far down as 400 miles---mile%1:23:01:: below the surface---surface%1:17:00:: the material---material%1:27:00:: should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces---force%1:19:00:: by sluggish flow---flow%1:11:00:: rather than by breaking , as rigid surface rocks---rock%1:17:01:: do .
( 2 ) If earthquakes---earthquake%1:11:00:: do occur at such depths---depth%1:07:00:: , why not deeper ?
Knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: gained from studying earthquake---earthquake%1:11:00:: waves---wave%1:11:00:: has been applied in various fields---field%1:09:00:: .
In the search---search%1:04:00:: for oil---oil%1:27:00:: and gas---gas%1:27:02:: , we make similar waves---wave%1:11:00:: under controlled conditions---condition%1:26:00:: with dynamite---dynamite%1:06:00:: and learn from them where there are buried rock---rock%1:27:00:: structures---structure%1:06:00:: favorable to the accumulation---accumulation%1:22:00:: of these resources---resource%1:21:00:: .
We have also developed techniques---technique%1:09:00:: for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests---test%1:04:00:: through the waves---wave%1:11:00:: in the ground---ground%1:17:00:: which they generate .
The following discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: of this subject---subject%1:09:01:: has been adapted from the book---book%1:10:00:: Causes of Catastrophe by L. Don Leet---person%1:03:00:: .
At twelve minutes---minute%1:28:00:: after five---five%1:23:00:: on the morning---morning%1:28:00:: of Wednesday---wednesday%1:28:00:: , April---april%1:28:00:: 18 , 1906 , San Francisco---san_francisco%1:15:00:: was shaken by a severe earthquake---earthquake%1:11:00:: .
A sharp tremor---tremor%1:11:00:: was followed by a jerky roll---roll%1:11:01:: .
There was a crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: in the stands for a change---change%1:24:00:: and the sun---sun%1:19:00:: was hot .
The new Riverside---location%1:03:00:: pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: turned out to have an overhand fast ball---fastball%1:04:00:: that took a hop---hop%1:04:00:: .
For a few innings---inning%1:28:00:: the Anniston---location%1:03:00:: team---team%1:14:00:: could n't figure him out .
Then , in the fifth , Anniston---location%1:03:00:: 's kid---kid%1:18:00:: catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: caught onto a curve---curve%1:04:02:: and smacked the ball---ball%1:06:01:: into left center field---centerfield%1:06:00:: .
Eddie Lee---person%1:03:00:: , Riverside---location%1:03:00:: 's redheaded playing---playing%1:04:00:: manager---manager%1:18:01:: , ran after the ball---ball%1:06:01:: but it rolled past him .
Phil Rossoff---person%1:03:00:: cut over to center---center%1:06:02:: from left field---leftfield%1:06:00:: to get the relay---relay%1:04:00:: .
Eddie---person%1:03:00:: caught up with the ball---ball%1:06:01:: near the fence---fence%1:06:00:: and threw it to Phil---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Third---third%1:04:00:: !
Third base---third_base%1:06:00:: '' !
Eddie---person%1:03:00:: shouted .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: spun around and made an accurate throw---throw%1:04:00:: into Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: 's hands---hand%1:08:00:: on third base---third_base%1:06:00:: .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: caught the ball---ball%1:06:01:: just as the catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: slid into the bag---bag%1:06:03:: .
But the Anniston---location%1:03:00:: boy---boy%1:18:02:: had begun his slide---slide%1:04:00:: too late .
He came into the bag---bag%1:06:03:: with his body---body%1:08:00:: and Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: brought the ball---ball%1:06:01:: down full in his face---face%1:08:00:: .
`` You bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: '' ! the Anniston---person%1:03:00:: catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: screamed .
He jumped to his feet and started to throw punches---punch%1:04:00:: .
Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: tossed his glove---glove%1:06:01:: away and began to swing at the catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: .
This brought in everybody from both sides---side%1:14:00:: , while the spectators---spectator%1:18:00:: stood up and added to the uproar---uproar%1:26:00:: .
The fighters---fighter%1:18:00:: were separated in a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
The game---game%1:04:00:: was resumed .
But Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: was boiling mad now .
When the inning---inning%1:28:00:: was over he cursed the Anniston---location%1:03:00:: catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: all the way into the dugout---dugout%1:06:01:: .
Phil Rossoff---person%1:03:00:: , coming in from left field---leftfield%1:06:00:: , stopped at the water fountain---water_fountain%1:06:00:: for a drink---drink%1:13:00:: .
Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: was standing beside it , facing the field---field%1:15:02:: .
He was eyeing the Anniston---person%1:03:00:: catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: warming up his pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: before the inning---inning%1:28:00:: began .
`` Keep your eyes---eye%1:08:00:: open , sonny---sonny%1:18:00:: '' !
Mike---person%1:03:00:: yelled to the catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: .
`` You 're in for trouble---trouble%1:11:00:: '' .
The Anniston---location%1:03:00:: catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: did not reply with words---words%1:10:03:: .
He simply turned to Mike---person%1:03:00:: and smiled .
This so infuriated Deegan---person%1:03:00:: that he spun around and said : `` I 'll get that little bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: .
Phil Rossoff---person%1:03:00:: said : `` Why do n't you leave him alone '' ?
`` Mind your own goddamn business---business%1:09:01:: '' , Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: said .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: shrugged .
He stepped into the dugout---dugout%1:06:01:: , wondering why Deegan---person%1:03:00:: was always looking for trouble---trouble%1:11:00:: .
Maybe the answer---answer%1:10:02:: was in his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
When Deegan---person%1:03:00:: smiled his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: never fit in with his lips---lip%1:08:00:: .
In the last---last%1:28:00:: of the sixth inning---inning%1:28:00:: Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: got up to bat and hit a fast ball---fastball%1:04:00:: over the left fielder---left_fielder%1:18:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: .
By the time---time%1:11:00:: the fielder---fielder%1:18:00:: got his hands---hand%1:08:00:: on the ball---ball%1:06:01:: Deegan---person%1:03:00:: was rounding third base---third_base%1:06:00:: and heading for home---home%1:06:02:: .
The left fielder---left_fielder%1:18:00:: threw and it was a good one .
But Mike---person%1:03:00:: had no chance---chance%1:26:00:: of being tagged .
The Anniston---location%1:03:00:: catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: was straddling home plate---home_plate%1:06:00:: .
All Deegan---person%1:03:00:: had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: .
Both fell heavily to the ground---ground%1:17:00:: .
Only Mike---person%1:03:00:: got to his feet .
He went back to touch home plate---home_plate%1:06:00:: , turned and walked to the dugout---dugout%1:06:01:: without looking back .
The Anniston---location%1:03:00:: players---player%1:18:01:: and their manager---manager%1:18:01:: ran out on the field---field%1:15:02:: .
They poured water---water%1:27:00:: over their catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: 's face---face%1:08:00:: .
Then the manager---manager%1:18:01:: called for a doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: .
The Riverside---location%1:03:00:: physician---physician%1:18:00:: came down to look over the injured ballplayer---ballplayer%1:18:00:: .
Then , quickly , and a little nervously , the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: ordered a couple of ballplayers---ballplayer%1:18:00:: to carry the catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: into the dressing room---dressing_room%1:06:00:: .
Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: was sitting on the bench , watching .
When the ballplayers---ballplayer%1:18:00:: started to carry the catcher---catcher%1:18:00:: off the field---field%1:15:02:: he said : `` That ought to teach the sonofabitch '' .
Phil Rossoff---person%1:03:00:: , seated next to Deegan---person%1:03:00:: , got up and moved to the other end---end%1:15:00:: of the bench .
The Anniston---location%1:03:00:: manager---manager%1:18:01:: was coming over to the Riverside---location%1:03:00:: dugout---dugout%1:06:01:: .
He was followed by four of his men---men%1:14:00:: .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: sat quietly watching the manager---manager%1:18:01:: come nearer .
Eddie Lee---person%1:03:00:: moved over to Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: 's side---side%1:15:02:: .
No one said a word---word%1:10:00:: .
The Anniston---location%1:03:00:: manager---manager%1:18:01:: came right up to the dugout---dugout%1:06:01:: in front of Mike---person%1:03:00:: .
His face---face%1:08:00:: was flushed .
`` Deegan---person%1:03:00:: '' , the manager---manager%1:18:01:: said , his voice---voice%1:10:00:: pitched low , quivering .
`` That was a rotten thing---thing%1:11:00:: to do '' .
`` For God---god%1:18:00:: 's sake---sake%1:07:00:: '' , Mike---person%1:03:00:: said , waving the manager---manager%1:18:01:: away .
Tell your guys---guy%1:18:00:: not to block the plate---plate%1:06:04:: '' .
The Anniston---location%1:03:00:: manager---manager%1:18:01:: looked at Eddie Lee---person%1:03:00:: .
It was a cold and calculated look---look%1:07:01:: .
He turned and went back across the field---field%1:15:02:: to his dugout---dugout%1:06:01:: .
He called in the pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound---mound%1:06:01:: for Anniston---location%1:03:00:: .
The game---game%1:04:00:: started again and in the eighth inning---inning%1:28:00:: Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: came up to bat .
Everyone in the ball park---ballpark%1:06:00:: seemed to be standing and shouting .
The first ball---ball%1:06:01:: the hefty pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: threw came in for Mike---person%1:03:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: .
Deegan---person%1:03:00:: fell into the dirt---dirt%1:27:01:: , the ball---ball%1:06:01:: going over him .
He got back into the batter's box---batter's_box%1:06:00:: and on the next pitch---pitch%1:04:03:: dropped into the dirt---dirt%1:27:01:: again .
`` Hit the bum---bum%1:18:02:: '' ! somebody yelled from the Anniston---location%1:03:00:: bench .
In the Riverside---location%1:03:00:: dugout---dugout%1:06:01:: Frankie Ricco---person%1:03:00:: , shortstop---shortstop%1:18:00:: , whispered into Phil---person%1:03:00:: 's ear---ear%1:08:00:: : `` There 's gonna be a fight---fight%1:04:02:: '' .
`` Look at those bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: '' !
Charlie Haydon---person%1:03:00:: , a pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: , said .
`` They 're looking for trouble---trouble%1:11:00:: '' .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: was slow getting into the box---batter's_box%1:06:00:: this time---time%1:11:00:: .
When he finally did he had to duck his head---head%1:08:00:: quickly away as the pitch---pitch%1:04:03:: came in .
`` Listen '' ! he shouted to the pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: .
`` I 'll be waiting '' ! the pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: yelled back .
Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: pounded the rubber---rubber%1:27:00:: plate---plate%1:06:04:: with the end---end%1:15:00:: of his bat .
He stood flat-footed in the box---batter's_box%1:06:00:: , but not very close to the plate---plate%1:06:04:: now .
The pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: wound up and the ball---ball%1:06:01:: came in straight for Mike---person%1:03:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: .
Deegan---person%1:03:00:: dropped , got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands---hand%1:08:00:: up against his chest---chest%1:08:00:: , began to walk slowly out to the mound---mound%1:06:01:: .
The pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: tossed his glove---glove%1:06:01:: away and came towards Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: .
Riverside---location%1:03:00:: and Anniston---location%1:03:00:: players---player%1:18:01:: rushed out on the field---field%1:15:02:: .
In the next moment---moment%1:28:00:: , it seemed , the infield---infield%1:06:00:: was crowded with spectators---spectator%1:18:00:: , ballplayers---ballplayer%1:18:00:: , cops---cop%1:18:00:: , kids---kid%1:18:00:: and a dog---dog%1:05:00:: .
There was much shouting---shouting%1:10:00:: and screaming---screaming%1:10:00:: .
Fights---fight%1:04:02:: sprang up and were quickly squelched .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: and the Anniston---location%1:03:00:: pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: were pulled away before they even came together .
Phil Rossoff---person%1:03:00:: and two other Riverside---location%1:03:00:: players---player%1:18:01:: did not go out on the field---field%1:15:02:: when the fighting---fighting%1:04:00:: started .
After the game---game%1:04:00:: , Phil---person%1:03:00:: was taking off his sweatshirt---sweatshirt%1:06:00:: in the dressing room---dressing_room%1:06:00:: when Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: came in .
`` It 's a helluva thing---thing%1:26:00:: '' , Mike---person%1:03:00:: said , looking at Phil---person%1:03:00:: , `` when a guy---guy%1:18:00:: 's own team-mate---teammate%1:18:00:: won n't come out and help him in a fight---fight%1:04:02:: '' .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt---sweatshirt%1:06:00:: over his head---head%1:08:00:: .
Frankie Ricco---person%1:03:00:: sat down on the bench---bench%1:06:00:: near Phil---person%1:03:00:: .
The other players---player%1:18:01:: were undressing quietly .
Eddie Lee---person%1:03:00:: had not come in yet .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: went over to Phil---person%1:03:00:: and stood over him .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: placed both his hands---hand%1:08:00:: on his hips---hip%1:08:00:: .
He pushed his jaw---jaw%1:08:00:: forward .
`` Listen , wise guy---wise_guy%1:18:00:: , if you think I 'm gonna do all the fighting---fighting%1:04:00:: for this ball club---ball_club%1:14:00:: you 're crazy '' .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: had a good two inches---inch%1:23:00:: over Phil---person%1:03:00:: and Phil---person%1:03:00:: had to look up into Mike---person%1:03:00:: 's face---face%1:08:00:: .
`` I did n't ask you to fight for the ball club---ball_club%1:14:00:: '' , Phil---person%1:03:00:: said slowly .
`` You trying to say I started the fight---fight%1:04:02:: '' ?
Phil---person%1:03:00:: turned away and opened his locker---locker%1:06:00:: , and then he heard Mike Deegan---person%1:03:00:: say : `` You 're yellow , Rossoff---person%1:03:00:: '' !
and Phil---person%1:03:00:: banged his locker---locker%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:00:: shut and spun around .
But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco---person%1:03:00:: was between them and Eddie Lee---person%1:03:00:: had come into the dressing room---dressing_room%1:06:00:: .
`` Phil---person%1:03:00:: , come into my office---office%1:06:00:: '' , Eddie---person%1:03:00:: said .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: followed Eddie---person%1:03:00:: into the office---office%1:06:00:: and shut the door---door%1:06:00:: .
He sat down before Eddie---person%1:03:00:: 's desk---desk%1:06:00:: .
`` I 'm doing you a favor---favor%1:04:00:: '' , Eddie---person%1:03:00:: said quickly .
`` You get your unconditional release---release%1:04:02:: as of today---today%1:28:01:: '' .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: 's eyes---eye%1:08:00:: widened just a trifle .
`` The best thing---thing%1:04:00:: for you to do '' , Eddie---person%1:03:00:: said , `` is go home .
You do n't belong in professional baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: '' .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: had to clear his throat---throat%1:08:00:: .
`` No '' , Eddie---person%1:03:00:: said .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: stood up .
This is the second time---time%1:11:00:: '' .
`` Sit down , sit down '' , Eddie---person%1:03:00:: said .
I am saying you 're not a professional ballplayer---ballplayer%1:18:00:: '' .
Eddie Lee---person%1:03:00:: leaned forward over the desk---desk%1:06:00:: .
`` Now listen to me , Phil---person%1:03:00:: .
You have n't got the heart---heart%1:07:01:: for baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: '' .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: and Eddie---person%1:03:00:: frowned .
Suddenly his voice---voice%1:07:00:: grew hard .
`` What the hell do you think baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: is ?
You 're not in the big leagues---big_league%1:14:00:: , but if you can n't give and take down here what the hell do you think it 'll be like up there '' ?
Phil---person%1:03:00:: started to say something but Eddie---person%1:03:00:: cut him short .
`` Now do n't tell me what a good ball player---ballplayer%1:18:00:: you are .
I know you 've got talent---talent%1:09:00:: .
But what you have n't got is the heart---heart%1:07:01:: to back up that talent---talent%1:09:00:: with .
The heart---heart%1:07:01:: , Phil---person%1:03:00:: .
You just have n't got the heart---heart%1:07:01:: for pro-ball , and that 's it '' .
Dazed , Phil---person%1:03:00:: said : `` I do n't get it .
My batting average---batting_average%1:24:00:: & & & '' .
Eddie---person%1:03:00:: stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly .
`` What difference---difference%1:07:00:: does your batting average---batting_average%1:24:00:: make ?
Or your fielding average---fielding_average%1:24:00:: .
Or even the way---way%1:07:01:: you run bases .
That 's what I mean by no heart---heart%1:07:01:: for the game---game%1:04:00:: .
Baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: 's no cinch---cinch%1:04:01:: .
Deegan---person%1:03:00:: had no business---business%1:09:01:: ramming into that kid---kid%1:18:00:: out there .
He did it because he knows for each guy---guy%1:18:00:: he puts out of commission that 's one less who might take his job---job%1:04:00:: away later on .
What the hell do you think baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: is ?
A sport---sport%1:04:00:: ?
It 's a way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: , goddamit !
And you 've got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who want to take your way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: away from you '' !
Phil---person%1:03:00:: thought .
It 's only his opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: .
There were other clubs---club%1:14:01:: in this league---league%1:14:01:: .
His lips---lip%1:08:00:: felt glued together .
`` I think you 're wrong , Eddie---person%1:03:00:: '' , he said finally .
Eddie---person%1:03:00:: nodded .
You 'll get your pay---pay%1:21:01:: in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: '' .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: turned and left the room---room%1:06:00:: , hearing Eddie---person%1:03:00:: say :
Phil---person%1:03:00:: shut the door---door%1:06:00:: behind him .
Outside in the dressing room---dressing_room%1:06:00:: , Frankie Ricco---person%1:03:00:: sat on the bench---bench%1:06:00:: dressed in his street clothes---street_clothes%1:06:00:: .
Frankie---person%1:03:00:: asked .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: said : `` I got my release---release%1:04:02:: '' .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: shrugged .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: sighed .
Frankie---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
`` I do n't know '' , Phil---person%1:03:00:: said .
They were silent for a few moments---moment%1:28:01:: .
Then Frankie---person%1:03:00:: said : `` What are you gonna do '' ?
Phil---person%1:03:00:: started to take his clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: off and Frankie---person%1:03:00:: sat down on the bench---bench%1:06:00:: again .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: took off one shoe---shoe%1:06:00:: and stared at it .
`` Do n't take it like this '' , Frankie---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Hell , plenty---plenty%1:07:00:: of guys---guy%1:18:00:: get let out and come back later .
The leagues---league%1:14:01:: are full of guys---guy%1:18:00:: like that '' .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: was very quiet .
`` What are you gonna do , Phil---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Phil---person%1:03:00:: did not answer .
`` Why not try another club---club%1:14:01:: '' ?
Phil---person%1:03:00:: looked up .
What the hell right---right%1:07:00:: did Eddie---person%1:03:00:: have saying a thing---thing%1:09:00:: like that ?
`` Springfield---springfield%1:15:00:: 's in tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:01:: '' , Frankie---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Talk to Whitey Jackson---person%1:03:00:: '' .
He just did n't know what he was talking about , saying a thing---thing%1:09:00:: like that .
`` Will you do it , Phil---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` Ask Whitey---person%1:03:00:: for a job---job%1:04:00:: '' .
Phil---person%1:03:00:: nodded .
`` Springfield---springfield%1:15:00:: come in tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:01:: '' ?
Frankie---person%1:03:00:: nodded .
`` I 'll speak to Whitey---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` Do n't worry '' , Frankie---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` You 'll get a job---job%1:04:00:: there .
He needs outfielders---outfielder%1:18:00:: bad '' .
`` I 'm not worried about it '' , Phil---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` That 's the way---way%1:07:01:: to talk .
What else did Eddie---person%1:03:00:: have to say '' ?
`` Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: '' , Phil---person%1:03:00:: said .
Mr. Speaker---person%1:03:00:: , for several years---year%1:28:01:: now the commuter---commuter%1:06:00:: railroads---railroad%1:06:00:: serving our large metropolitan areas---area%1:15:01:: have found it increasingly difficult to render the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of service---service%1:04:08:: our expanding population---population%1:14:00:: wants and is entitled to have .
The causes---cause%1:11:00:: of the decline---decline%1:26:00:: of the commuter---commuter%1:06:00:: railroads---railroad%1:06:00:: are many and complex - high taxes---tax%1:21:00:: , losses---losses%1:21:00:: of revenue---revenue%1:21:01:: to Government---government%1:14:00:: subsidized highway---highway%1:06:00:: and air carriers---carrier%1:06:03:: , to name but two .
And the solutions---solution%1:09:00:: to the problems---problem%1:26:00:: of the commuter---commuter%1:06:00:: lines---line%1:06:03:: have been equally varied , ranging all the way from Government---government%1:14:00:: ownership---ownership%1:04:00:: to complete discontinuance---discontinuance%1:04:00:: of this important service---service%1:04:08:: .
There have been a number---number%1:07:00:: of sound plans---plan%1:09:00:: proposed .
Instead we have stood idly by , watched our commuter---commuter%1:06:00:: railroad---railroad%1:06:00:: service---service%1:04:08:: decline , and have failed to offer a helping hand---helping_hand%1:04:00:: .
Though the number---number%1:07:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: flowing in and out of our metropolitan areas---area%1:26:00:: each day has increased tremendously since World War 2---world_war_ii%1:04:00:: , , total annual rail---rail%1:06:03:: commutation---commutation%1:04:00:: dropped 124 million from 1947 to 1957 .
Nowhere has this decline---decline%1:26:00:: been more painfully evident than in the New York City---new_york_city%1:15:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: .
Here the New York Central Railroad---group%1:03:00:: , one of the Nation---nation%1:14:00:: 's most important carriers---carrier%1:14:00:: , has alone lost 47.6 percent---percent%1:24:00:: of its passengers---passenger%1:18:00:: since 1949 .
At this time---time%1:11:00:: of crisis---crisis%1:26:00:: in our Nation---nation%1:14:00:: 's commuter---commuter%1:06:00:: railroads---railroad%1:06:00:: , a new threat---threat%1:26:00:: to the continued operations---operation%1:26:00:: of the New York Central---group%1:03:00:: has appeared in the form---form%1:07:03:: of the Chesapeake + Ohio Railroad---group%1:03:00:: 's proposal---proposal%1:10:00:: for control---control%1:07:00:: of the Baltimore + Ohio railroads---group%1:03:00:: .
The New York Central---group%1:03:00:: has pointed out that this control---control%1:07:00:: , if approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission---group%1:03:00:: , would give the combined C.+O.---group%1:03:00:: - B.+O. Railroad---group%1:03:00:: a total---total%1:09:00:: of 185 points---point%1:15:00:: served in common with the New York Central---group%1:03:00:: .
Not only is this kind---kind%1:09:00:: of duplication---duplication%1:04:00:: wasteful , but it gives the combined system---system%1:14:00:: the ability---ability%1:07:00:: to take freight---freight%1:04:00:: traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: away from the New York Central---group%1:03:00:: and other railroads---railroad%1:06:00:: serving the area---area%1:15:01:: .
The New York Central---group%1:03:00:: notes : `` The freight---freight%1:06:00:: traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: most susceptible to raiding by the C.---group%1:03:00:: + O. - B.---group%1:03:00:: + O.---group%1:03:00:: provides the backbone---backbone%1:09:00:: of Central---group%1:03:00:: 's revenues---revenue%1:21:01:: .
These revenues---revenue%1:21:01:: make it possible to provide essential freight---freight%1:06:00:: and passenger---passenger%1:18:00:: service---service%1:04:08:: over the entire New York Central---group%1:03:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: as well as the New York---new_york%1:15:01:: area---area%1:26:00:: commuter---commuter%1:18:00:: and terminal---terminal%1:06:00:: freight---freight%1:06:00:: services---services%1:04:00:: .
If these services---services%1:04:00:: are to be maintained , the New York Central---group%1:03:00:: must have the revenues---revenue%1:21:01:: to make them possible '' .
The New York Central---group%1:03:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: handles 60 percent---percent%1:24:00:: of all southbound commuter traffic---commuter_traffic%1:14:00:: coming into New York City---new_york_city%1:15:00:: .
This is a $ 14 million operation---operation%1:04:03:: involving 3500 employees---employee%1:18:00:: who work on commuter traffic---commuter_traffic%1:14:00:: exclusively .
A blow---blow%1:11:02:: to this phase---phase%1:28:00:: of the Central---group%1:03:00:: 's operations---operation%1:26:00:: would have serious economic consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: not only to the railroad---railroad%1:06:00:: itself , but to the 40000 people---people%1:14:01:: per day---day%1:28:00:: who are provided with efficient , reasonably priced transportation---transportation%1:06:00:: in and out of the city---city%1:15:00:: .

The Central---group%1:03:00:: has pointed out .
`` The logic---logic%1:09:03:: of creating a strong , balanced , competitive two system---system%1:14:00:: railroad---railroad%1:06:00:: service---service%1:04:08:: in the East---east%1:15:01:: is so obvious that B. + O.---group%1:03:00:: was publicly committed to the approach---approach%1:04:02:: outlined here .
Detailed studies---study%1:04:00:: of the plan---plan%1:09:01:: were well underway .
Though far from completion , these studies---study%1:04:00:: indicated beyond a doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: that savings---saving%1:04:00:: would result which would be of unprecedented benefit---benefit%1:07:00:: to the railroads---railroad%1:06:00:: concerned , their investors---investor%1:18:00:: , their customers---customer%1:18:00:: , their users---user%1:18:00:: , and to the public---public%1:14:00:: at large .
Then , abandoning the studies---study%1:04:00:: in the face of their promising outlook---outlook%1:09:00:: for all concerned , B. + O. entered on-again-off-again negotiations---negotiation%1:10:00:: with C. + O. which resulted in the present situation---situation%1:26:01:: .
In the light---light%1:09:01:: of the facts---fact%1:09:01:: at hand , however , New York Central---group%1:03:00:: intends to pursue the objective---objective%1:09:00:: of helping to create a healthy two system---system%1:06:00:: eastern railroad---railroad%1:06:00:: structure---structure%1:06:00:: in the public interest---interest%1:07:01:: `` .
The Interstate Commerce Commission---group%1:03:00:: will commence its deliberations---deliberation%1:10:00:: on the proposed C. + O. - B.---group%1:03:00:: +---group%1:03:00:: O. merger---merger%1:04:00:: on June---june%1:28:00:: 18 .
Obviously , the Interstate Commerce Commission---group%1:03:00:: will not force the New York Central---group%1:03:00:: to further curtail its commuter---commuter%1:06:00:: operations---operation%1:04:06:: by giving undue competitive advantages---advantage%1:07:00:: to the lines---line%1:06:03:: that wish to merge .
However , there is a more profound consideration---consideration%1:09:01:: to this proposed merger---merger%1:04:00:: than profit---profit%1:21:00:: and loss---loss%1:21:00:: .
That is , will it serve the long-range public interest---interest%1:07:01:: ?
For the past 40 years---year%1:28:01:: Congress---congress%1:14:01:: has advocated a carefully planned , balanced and competitive railway system---railway_system%1:06:00:: .
We must ask ourselves which of the two alternatives---alternative%1:09:00:: will help the commuter---commuter%1:18:00:: - the two-way B. + O. - C. +---group%1:03:00:: O. merger---merger%1:04:00:: , or the three way New York Central---group%1:03:00:: B. + O. - C. + O.---group%1:03:00:: merger---merger%1:04:00:: .
Which will serve not only the best interest---interest%1:07:01:: of the stockholders---stockholder%1:18:00:: , but the interests---interest%1:07:01:: of all the traveling public---public%1:14:01:: ?
Mr. Speaker---person%1:03:00:: , I rise today---today%1:28:01:: to pay tribute---tribute%1:10:01:: to a great newspaper---newspaper%1:14:00:: , the New York Times---group%1:03:00:: , on the occasion---occasion%1:11:00:: of a major change---change%1:04:00:: in its top executive---top_executive%1:18:00:: command---command%1:26:00:: .
Arthur Hays Sulzberger---person%1:03:00:: has been a distinguished publisher---publisher%1:18:00:: of this distinguished newspaper---newspaper%1:14:00:: and it is fitting that we take due notice of his major contribution---contribution%1:04:02:: to American journalism---journalism%1:10:00:: on the occasion---occasion%1:11:00:: of his retirement---retirement%1:26:00:: .
I am pleased to note that Mr. Sulzberger---person%1:03:00:: will continue to serve as chairman of the board---chairman_of_the_board%1:18:00:: of the New York Times---group%1:03:00:: .
Mr. Sulzberger---person%1:03:00:: 's successor---successor%1:18:01:: as publisher---publisher%1:18:00:: is Mr. Orvil E. Dryfoos---person%1:03:00:: , who is president---president%1:18:01:: of the New York Times Co.---group%1:03:00:: , and who has been with the Times---group%1:03:00:: since 1942 .
Mr. Dryfoos---person%1:03:00:: ' outstanding career---career%1:04:01:: as a journalist---journalist%1:18:00:: guarantees that the high standards---standard%1:09:00:: which have made the Times---group%1:03:00:: one---one%1:23:00:: of the world 's great newspapers---newspaper%1:10:00:: will be maintained .
I am also pleased to note that Mr. John B. Oakes---person%1:03:00:: , a member---member%1:18:00:: of the Times---group%1:03:00:: staff---staff%1:14:01:: since 1946 , has been appointed as editorial page---page%1:10:00:: editor---editor%1:18:00:: .
Mr. Oakes---person%1:03:00:: succeeds Charles Merz---person%1:03:00:: , editor---editor%1:18:00:: since 1938 , who now becomes editor---editor%1:18:00:: emeritus .
I should like at this time---time%1:28:06:: , Mr. Speaker---person%1:03:00:: , to pay warm tribute---tribute%1:10:01:: to Arthur Hays Sulzberger---person%1:03:00:: and Charles Merz---person%1:03:00:: on the occasion---occasion%1:11:00:: of their retirement---retirement%1:26:00:: from distinguished careers---career%1:04:01:: in American journalism---journalism%1:10:00:: .
My heartiest congratulations---congratulation%1:10:00:: go to their successors---successor%1:09:00:: , Orvil E. Dryfoos---person%1:03:00:: and John B. Oakes---person%1:03:00:: , who can be counted upon to sustain the illustrious tradition---tradition%1:09:02:: of the New York Times---group%1:03:00:: .
The people---people%1:14:01:: of the 17 th District---district%1:15:00:: of New York---new_york%1:15:00:: , and I as their Representative---representative%1:18:01:: in Congress---congress%1:14:01:: , take great pride in the New York Times---group%1:03:00:: as one of the great and authoritative newspapers---newspaper%1:10:00:: of the world .
The people of the 17 th District of New York , and I as their Representative in Congress , take great pride in the New York Times as one of the great and authoritative newspapers---newspaper%1:14:00:: of the world .
Mr. Speaker---person%1:03:00:: , in my latest newsletter---newsletter%1:10:00:: to my constituents---constituent%1:18:00:: I urged the imposition---imposition%1:04:02:: of a naval blockade---naval_blockade%1:04:00:: of Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: as the only effective method---method%1:09:00:: of preventing continued Soviet armaments---armament%1:06:00:: from coming into the Western Hemisphere---western_hemisphere%1:15:00:: in violation---violation%1:04:00:: of the Monroe Doctrine---monroe_doctrine%1:10:00:: .
Yesterday---yesterday%1:28:01:: , I had the privilege---privilege%1:07:02:: of reading a thoughtful article---article%1:10:00:: in the U. S. News + World Report of May---may%1:28:00:: 8 which discussed this type---type%1:09:00:: of action---action%1:04:03:: in more detail---detail%1:09:00:: , including both its advantages---advantage%1:07:00:: and its disadvantages---disadvantage%1:07:00:: .
Under leave---leave%1:10:00:: to extend my remarks---remark%1:10:00:: , I include the relevant portion---portion%1:24:00:: of my newsletter---newsletter%1:10:00:: , together with the text---text%1:10:00:: of the article---article%1:10:00:: from the U. S. News + World Report :
Cuban S. S. R.---group%1:03:00:: : Whatever may have been the setbacks---setback%1:11:01:: resulting from the unsuccessful attempt---attempt%1:04:02:: of the Cuban rebels---rebel%1:18:00:: to establish a beachhead---beachhead%1:15:00:: on the Castro---person%1:03:00:: held mainland---mainland%1:17:00:: last week---week%1:28:00:: , there was at least one positive benefit---benefit%1:07:00:: , and that was the clear-cut revelation---revelation%1:10:02:: to the whole world of the complete conversion---conversion%1:11:00:: of Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: into a Russian dominated military base---base%1:06:04:: .
In fact , one of the major reasons---reason%1:10:01:: for the failure---failure%1:04:00:: of the ill-starred expedition---expedition%1:04:01:: appears to have been a lack---lack%1:26:00:: of full information---information%1:09:00:: on the extent---extent%1:26:00:: to which Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: has been getting this Russian military equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: .
Somehow , the pictures---picture%1:06:00:: and stories---story%1:10:01:: of Soviet T-34 tanks---tank%1:06:01:: on Cuban beaches---beach%1:17:00:: and Russian Mig jet---jet%1:06:00:: fighters---fighter%1:06:00:: strafing rebel---rebel%1:18:00:: troops---troops%1:14:00:: has brought home to all of us the stark , blunt truth---truth%1:26:00:: of what it means to have a Russian military base---base%1:06:04:: 90 miles---mile%1:23:01:: away from home---home%1:15:02:: .
Russian tanks---tank%1:06:01:: and planes---plane%1:06:01:: in Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: jeopardize the security---security%1:26:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: , violate the Monroe Doctrine---monroe_doctrine%1:10:00:: , and threaten the security---security%1:26:00:: of every other Latin American republic---republic%1:14:00:: .
Once the full extent of this Russian military penetration of Cuba was clear , President Kennedy announced we would take whatever action---action%1:04:02:: was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone .
Once the full extent---extent%1:26:00:: of this Russian military penetration---penetration%1:04:00:: of Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: was clear , President Kennedy---person%1:03:00:: announced we would take whatever action---action%1:04:03:: was appropriate to prevent this , even if we had to go it alone .
But the Latin American---latin_american%1:18:00:: republics---republic%1:14:00:: who have been rather inclined to drag their feet on taking action---action%1:04:02:: against Castro---person%1:03:00:: also reacted swiftly last week---week%1:28:00:: by finally throwing Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: off the Inter-American Defense Board---group%1:03:00:: .
For years---years%1:28:01:: the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: had been trying to get these countries---country%1:14:00:: to exclude Castro---person%1:03:00:: 's representative---representative%1:18:00:: from secret military talks---talks%1:10:00:: .
But it took the pictures---picture%1:06:00:: of the Migs and the T-34 tanks---tank%1:06:01:: to do the job---job%1:04:01:: .
There is a new atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: of urgency---urgency%1:26:00:: in Washington---washington%1:15:01:: this week---week%1:28:00:: .
You can see it , for example , in the extensive efforts---effort%1:04:00:: President Kennedy has made to enlist solid bipartisan support for his actions toward both Cuba and Laos ; efforts , as I see it , which are being directed , by the way , toward support for future actions , not for those already past .
You can see it , for example , in the extensive efforts---effort%1:04:01:: President Kennedy---person%1:03:00:: has made to enlist solid bipartisan support---support%1:04:00:: for his actions---action%1:04:03:: toward both Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: and Laos---laos%1:15:00:: ; efforts---effort%1:04:00:: , as I see it , which are being directed , by the way , toward support---support%1:04:03:: for future actions---action%1:04:03:: , not for those already past .
What the next move---move%1:04:00:: will be only time---time%1:03:00:: , of course , will tell .
Personally , I think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade---naval_blockade%1:04:00:: of Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: .
We simply can n't tolerate further Russian weapons---weapon%1:06:00:: , including the possibility---possibility%1:09:03:: of long-range nuclear missiles---missile%1:06:01:: , being located in Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: .
Obviously , we can n't stop them from coming in , however , just by talk---talk%1:10:00:: .
A naval blockade---naval_blockade%1:04:00:: would be thoroughly in line---line%1:04:01:: with the Monroe Doctrine---monroe_doctrine%1:10:00:: , would be a relatively simple operation---operation%1:04:02:: to carry out , and would bring an abrupt end---end%1:11:00:: to Soviet penetration---penetration%1:04:00:: of our hemisphere---hemisphere%1:15:00:: `` .
Look at Castro---person%1:03:00:: now - cockier than ever with arms---arms%1:06:00:: and agents---agent%1:18:02:: to threaten the Americas .
How can the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: act ?
Blockade---blockade%1:04:00:: is one answer---answer%1:10:02:: offered by experts---expert%1:18:00:: .
In it they see a way---way%1:04:01:: to isolate Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: , stop infiltration---infiltration%1:04:00:: , maybe finish Castro---person%1:03:00:: , too .
This is the question---question%1:10:01:: now facing President Kennedy---person%1:03:00:: :
How to put a stop---stop%1:26:00:: to the Soviet buildup in Cuba and to Communist infiltration of this hemisphere ?
How to put a stop---stop%1:04:00:: to the Soviet buildup---buildup%1:04:00:: in Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: and to Communist---communist%1:18:00:: infiltration---infiltration%1:04:00:: of this hemisphere---hemisphere%1:15:00:: ?
On April---april%1:28:00:: 25 , the White House---white_house%1:14:00:: reported that a total embargo---embargo%1:10:00:: of remaining U. S.---u.s.%1:15:00:: trade---trade%1:04:05:: with Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: was being considered .
Its aim---aim%1:09:01:: : To undermine further Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: 's economy---economy%1:14:00:: .
weaken Castro---person%1:03:00:: .
Another strategy---strategy%1:09:00:: - bolder and tougher - was also attracting notice---notice%1:09:01:: in Washington---washington%1:15:01:: : a naval and air blockade---blockade%1:04:00:: to cut Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: off from the world , destroy Castro---person%1:03:00:: .
Blockade---blockade%1:04:00:: , in the view---view%1:10:00:: of military and civilian experts---expert%1:18:00:: , could restore teeth---tooth%1:04:00:: to the Monroe Doctrine---monroe_doctrine%1:10:00:: .
It could halt a flood---flood%1:23:00:: of Communist arms---arms%1:06:00:: and strategic supplies now reaching Castro---person%1:03:00:: .
It could stop Cuban re export---export%1:06:00:: of guns---gun%1:06:00:: and propaganda---propaganda%1:10:00:: materials---material%1:06:01:: to South America---south_america%1:17:00:: .
It could stop Cuban re export of guns---gun%1:06:01:: and propaganda materials to South America .
It would be the most severe reprisal---reprisal%1:04:00:: , short of declared war---war%1:26:00:: , that the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: could invoke against Castro---person%1:03:00:: .
It is the strategy---strategy%1:09:00:: of blockade---blockade%1:04:00:: , therefore , that is suddenly at the center---center%1:09:00:: of attention---attention%1:09:00:: of administration---administration%1:14:00:: officials---official%1:18:01:: , Members---member%1:18:00:: of Congress---congress%1:14:01:: , officers---officer%1:18:03:: in the Pentagon---pentagon%1:14:00:: .
As a possible course---course%1:04:00:: of action---action%1:04:03:: , it also is the center---center%1:09:00:: of debate---debate%1:10:01:: and is raising many questions---question%1:10:00:: .
Among these questions---question%1:10:00:: :
Military---military%1:14:00:: experts---expert%1:18:00:: say a tight naval blockade---naval_blockade%1:04:00:: off Cuban ports---port%1:15:00:: and at the approaches---approach%1:06:00:: to Cuban waters---water%1:17:00:: would require two naval task forces---task_force%1:14:00:: , each built around an aircraft carrier---aircraft_carrier%1:06:00:: with a complement---complement%1:14:00:: of about 100 planes---plane%1:06:01:: and several destroyers---destroyer%1:06:00:: .
The Navy---us_navy%1:14:00:: , on April---april%1:28:00:: 25 , announced it is bringing back the carrier---carrier%1:06:01:: Shangri-La from the Mediterranean---mediterranean%1:17:00:: , increasing to four the number---number%1:23:00:: of attack carriers---attack_aircraft_carrier%1:06:00:: in the vicinity---vicinity%1:15:00:: of Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: .
More than 36 other big Navy---navy%1:14:00:: ships---ship%1:06:00:: are no less than a day---day%1:28:00:: 's sailing time---time%1:28:05:: away .
To round out the blockading force---force%1:14:00:: , submarines---submarine%1:06:00:: would be needed - to locate , identify and track approaching vessels---vessel%1:06:00:: .
Land based radar---radar%1:06:00:: would help with this task---task%1:04:01:: .
So would radar---radar%1:06:00:: picket ships---picket_ship%1:06:00:: .
A squadron---squadron%1:14:00:: of Navy---us_navy%1:14:00:: jets---jet%1:06:00:: and another of long-range patrol---patrol%1:04:00:: planes---plane%1:06:01:: would add support---support%1:04:00:: to the carrier---carrier%1:06:01:: task forces---task_force%1:14:00:: .
Three requirements---requirement%1:09:00:: go with a blockade---blockade%1:04:00:: : It must be proclaimed ; the blockading force---force%1:14:01:: must be powerful enough to enforce it ; and it must be enforced without discrimination---discrimination%1:04:00:: .
Once these conditions---condition%1:10:01:: of international law---international_law%1:14:00:: are met , countries---country%1:14:00:: that try to run to blockade---blockade%1:04:00:: do so at their own risk---risk%1:04:00:: .
Blockade---blockade%1:04:00:: runners---runner%1:18:01:: can be stopped - by gunfire---gunfire%1:04:00:: , if necessary - searched and held , at least temporarily .
They could be sent to U. S.---u.s.%1:15:00:: ports---port%1:15:00:: for rulings---ruling%1:04:00:: whether cargo---cargo%1:06:00:: should be confiscated .
Plenty , say the experts---expert%1:18:00:: .
In a broad sense---sense%1:10:00:: , it would reaffirm the Monroe Doctrine---monroe_doctrine%1:10:00:: by opposing Communist interference---interference%1:10:00:: in the Western Hemisphere---western_hemisphere%1:15:00:: .
It could , by avoiding direct intervention---intervention%1:04:00:: , provide a short-of war---war%1:26:00:: strategy---strategy%1:09:00:: to meet short-of war---war%1:26:00:: infiltration---infiltration%1:04:00:: .
Primary target---target%1:10:00:: would be shipments---shipment%1:06:00:: of tanks---tank%1:06:01:: , guns---gun%1:06:00:: , aviation---aviation%1:14:00:: gasoline---gasoline%1:27:00:: and ammunition---ammunition%1:06:00:: coming from Russia---russia%1:15:00:: and Czechoslovakia---czechoslovakia%1:15:00:: .
Primary target would be shipments of tanks , guns---gun%1:06:01:: , aviation gasoline and ammunition coming from Russia and Czechoslovakia .
Shipments---shipment%1:06:00:: of arms---arms%1:06:00:: from Western countries---country%1:14:00:: could similarly be seized as contraband .
In a total blockade---blockade%1:04:00:: , action---action%1:04:03:: could also be taken against ships---ship%1:06:00:: bringing in chemicals---chemical%1:27:00:: , oils---oil%1:27:00:: , textiles---textile%1:06:00:: , and even foodstuffs---foodstuff%1:06:00:: .
In a total blockade , action---action%1:04:02:: could also be taken against ships bringing in chemicals , oils , textiles , and even foodstuffs .
At times , three ships---ship%1:06:00:: a day---day%1:28:01:: from the Soviet bloc---bloc%1:14:00:: are unloading in Cuban ports---port%1:15:00:: .
Two facets---facet%1:09:00:: of this aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: of the literary process---process%1:04:00:: have special significance---significance%1:07:00:: for our time---time%1:28:00:: .
One , a reservation---reservation%1:10:00:: on the point---point%1:09:01:: I have just made , is the phenomenon---phenomenon%1:11:00:: of pseudo thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: , pseudo feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: , and pseudo willing---willing%1:04:00:: , which Fromm---person%1:03:00:: discussed in The Escape from Freedom .
In essence this involves grounding one 's thought---thought%1:09:00:: and emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: in the values---values%1:09:00:: and experience---experience%1:09:01:: of others , rather than in one 's own values---values%1:09:00:: and experience---experience%1:09:01:: .
There is a risk---risk%1:26:00:: that instead of teaching a person---person%1:03:00:: how to be himself , reading fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: and drama---drama%1:10:01:: may teach him how to be somebody else .
Clearly what the person---person%1:03:00:: brings to the reading---reading%1:10:00:: is important .
Moreover , if the critic---critic%1:18:00:: instructs his audience---audience%1:14:01:: in what to see in a work---work%1:06:00:: , he is contributing to this pseudo thinking ; if he instructs them in how to evaluate a work---work%1:06:00:: , he is helping them to achieve their own identity---identity%1:07:00:: .
The second timely part---part%1:24:00:: of this sketch---sketch%1:10:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: and the search---search%1:04:00:: for identity---identity%1:07:00:: has to do with the difference---difference%1:07:00:: between good and enduring literary works---literary_work%1:10:00:: and the ephemeral mass culture---mass_culture%1:09:00:: products---product%1:06:01:: of today .
In the range---range%1:07:00:: and variety---variety%1:07:00:: of characters---character%1:18:02:: who , in their literary lives---life%1:26:01:: , get along all right with life styles---life_style%1:07:00:: one never imagined possible , there is an implicit lesson---lesson%1:10:01:: in differentiation---differentiation%1:09:00:: .
The reader---reader%1:18:00:: , observing this process---process%1:04:00:: , might ask `` why not be different '' ? and find in the answer---answer%1:10:01:: a license---license%1:26:01:: to be a variant---variant%1:11:00:: of the human species---species%1:14:00:: .
The observer---observer%1:18:00:: of television---television%1:10:00:: or other products---product%1:06:00:: for a mass audience---audience%1:14:01:: has only a permit---permit%1:04:00:: to be , like the models---model%1:18:01:: he sees , even more like everybody else .
And this , I think , holds for values---values%1:09:00:: as well as life styles---life_style%1:07:00:: .
One would need to test this proposition---proposition%1:10:00:: carefully ; after all , the large ( and probably unreliable ) Reader 's Digest literature---literature%1:10:00:: on the `` most unforgettable character---character%1:18:02:: I ever met '' deals with village---village%1:14:00:: grocers---grocer%1:18:00:: , country doctors---country_doctor%1:18:00:: , favorite if illiterate aunts---aunt%1:18:00:: , and so forth .
Scientists---scientist%1:18:00:: often turn out to be idiosyncratic , too .
But still , the proposition---proposition%1:10:00:: is worth examination---examination%1:04:00:: .
It is possible that the study---study%1:09:03:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: affects the conscience---conscience%1:07:00:: , the morality---morality%1:07:00:: , the sensitivity---sensitivity%1:09:00:: to some code---code%1:10:01:: of `` right '' and `` wrong '' .
I do not know that this is true ; both Flugel---person%1:03:00:: and Ranyard West---person%1:03:00:: deal with the development---development%1:22:02:: and nature---nature%1:07:02:: of conscience---conscience%1:07:00:: , as do such theologians---theologian%1:18:00:: as Niebuhr---person%1:03:00:: and Buber---person%1:03:00:: .
It forms the core---core%1:09:00:: of many , perhaps most , problems---problem%1:10:00:: of psychotherapy---psychotherapy%1:09:00:: .
I am not aware of great attention---attention%1:04:01:: by any of these authors---author%1:18:00:: or by the psychotherapeutic profession---profession%1:14:00:: to the role---role%1:07:00:: of literary study---literary_study%1:09:00:: in the development---development%1:22:02:: of conscience---conscience%1:07:00:: - most of their attention---attention%1:04:01:: is to a pre-literate period---period%1:28:00:: of life---life%1:26:01:: , or , for the theologians---theologian%1:18:00:: of course , to the influence---influence%1:07:00:: of religion---religion%1:14:00:: .
Still , it would be surprising if what one reads did not contribute to one 's ideas---idea%1:09:00:: of right and wrong ; certainly the awakened alarm---alarm%1:12:00:: over the comic books---comic_book%1:10:00:: and the continuous concern---concern%1:09:00:: over prurient literature---literature%1:10:00:: indicate some peripheral aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: of this influence---influence%1:07:00:: .
Probably the most important thing---thing%1:09:02:: to focus on is not the development---development%1:22:02:: of conscience---conscience%1:07:00:: , which may well be almost beyond the reach---reach%1:07:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: , but the contents---content%1:09:00:: of conscience---conscience%1:07:00:: , the code---code%1:10:01:: which is imparted to the developed or immature conscience---conscience%1:07:00:: available .
This is in large part---part%1:24:00:: a code of behavior---code_of_behavior%1:09:00:: and a glossary---glossary%1:10:00:: of values---values%1:09:00:: : what is it that people---people%1:14:00:: do and should do and how one should regard it .
In a small way---way%1:26:00:: this is illustrated by the nineteenth century---century%1:28:00:: novelist---novelist%1:18:00:: who argued for the powerful influence---influence%1:07:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: as a teacher---teacher%1:09:00:: of society---society%1:14:00:: and who illustrated this with the way---way%1:04:01:: a girl---girl%1:18:00:: learned to meet her lover---lover%1:18:00:: , how to behave , how to think about this new experience---experience%1:11:00:: , how to exercise restraint---restraint%1:07:00:: .
Literature---literature%1:10:00:: may be said to give people---people%1:14:00:: a sense of purpose---sense_of_purpose%1:07:00:: , dedication---dedication%1:07:00:: , mission---mission%1:04:00:: , significance---significance%1:07:00:: .
This , no doubt , is part---part%1:24:00:: of what Gilbert Seldes---person%1:03:00:: implies when he says of the arts---arts%1:09:00:: , `` They give form---form%1:09:00:: and meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: to life---life%1:09:00:: which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense '' .
Men seem almost universally to want a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of function---function%1:07:00:: , that is , a feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: that their existence---existence%1:26:00:: makes a difference---difference%1:11:00:: to someone , living or unborn , close and immediate or generalized .
Feeling useless seems generally to be an unpleasant sensation---sensation%1:09:00:: .
A need---need%1:26:00:: so deeply planted , asking for direction---direction%1:10:00:: , so to speak , is likely to be gratified by the vivid examples---example%1:09:01:: and heroic proportions---proportion%1:07:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: .
The terms---term%1:10:00:: `` renewal---renewal%1:04:00:: '' and `` refreshed '' , which often come up in aesthetic discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: , seem partly to derive their import---import%1:10:00:: from the `` renewal---renewal%1:04:00:: '' of purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: and a `` refreshed '' sense---sense%1:09:05:: of significance---significance%1:07:00:: a person---person%1:03:00:: may receive from poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: , drama---drama%1:10:01:: , and fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: .
The notion---notion%1:09:00:: of `` inspiration---inspiration%1:09:02:: '' is somehow cognate to this feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: .
How literature---literature%1:10:00:: does this , or for whom , is certainly not clear , but the content---content%1:10:00:: , form---form%1:09:00:: , and language---language%1:10:00:: of the `` message---message%1:10:00:: '' , as well as the source---source%1:09:00:: , would all play differentiated parts---part%1:04:01:: in giving and molding a sense of purpose---sense_of_purpose%1:07:00:: .
One of the most salient features---feature%1:09:00:: of literary value---value%1:07:00:: has been deemed to be its influence---influence%1:07:00:: upon and organization---organization%1:09:00:: of emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: .
Let us differentiate a few of these ideas---idea%1:09:00:: .
The Aristotelian notion---notion%1:09:00:: of catharsis---catharsis%1:04:00:: , the purging---purging%1:04:00:: of emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: , is a persistent and viable one .
The idea---idea%1:09:00:: here is one of discharge---discharge%1:04:04:: but this must stand in opposition---opposition%1:24:02:: to a second view---view%1:09:02:: , Plato---plato%1:18:00:: 's notion---notion%1:09:00:: of the arousal---arousal%1:04:00:: of emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: .
A third idea---idea%1:09:00:: is that artistic literature---literature%1:10:00:: serves to reduce emotional conflicts---conflict%1:12:00:: , giving a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of serenity---serenity%1:07:00:: and calm---calm%1:07:00:: to individuals---individual%1:03:00:: .
This is given some expression---expression%1:10:04:: in Beardsley---person%1:03:00:: 's notion---notion%1:09:00:: of harmony---harmony%1:07:01:: and the resolution---resolution%1:04:01:: of indecision---indecision%1:09:00:: .
A fourth view---view%1:09:02:: is the transformation---transformation%1:11:00:: of emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: , as in Housman---person%1:03:00:: 's fine phrase---phrase%1:10:00:: on the arts---arts%1:09:00:: :
they `` transform and beautify our inner nature---nature%1:07:01:: '' .
It is possible that the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of enrichment---enrichment%1:04:00:: of emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: is a fifth idea---idea%1:09:00:: .
F. S. C. Northrop---person%1:03:00:: , in his discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: of the `` Functions and Future of Poetry '' , suggests this :
`` One of the things---thing%1:09:00:: which makes our lives---life%1:09:00:: drab and empty and which leaves us , at the end---end%1:28:00:: of the day---day%1:28:00:: , fatigued and deflated spiritually is the pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: of the taxing , practical , utilitarian concern---concern%1:09:00:: of common-sense objects---object%1:03:00:: .
If art---art%1:06:00:: is to release us from these postulated things---thing%1:09:00:: [ things---thing%1:09:00:: we must think symbolically about ] and bring us back to the ineffable beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: and richness---richness%1:07:03:: of the aesthetic component---component%1:09:00:: of reality---reality%1:09:00:: in its immediacy---immediacy%1:07:02:: , it must sever its connection---connection%1:26:00:: with these common sense entities---entity%1:03:00:: '' .
I take the central meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: here to be the contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: between the drab empty quality of life---quality_of_life%1:26:00:: without literature---literature%1:10:00:: and a life---life%1:09:00:: enriched by it .
Richards---person%1:03:00:: ' view---view%1:09:02:: of the aesthetic experience---experience%1:09:01:: might constitute a sixth variety : for him it constitutes , in part , the organization---organization%1:09:00:: of impulses---impulse%1:16:00:: .
A sketch---sketch%1:10:00:: of the emotional value---value%1:07:00:: of the study---study%1:09:03:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: would have to take account of all of these .
But there is one in particular which , it seems to me , deserves special attention---attention%1:09:00:: .
In the wide range---range%1:07:00:: of experiences---experience%1:09:01:: common to our earth-bound race---race%1:14:00:: none is more difficult to manage , more troublesome , and more enduring in its effects---effect%1:19:00:: than the control---control%1:04:02:: of love---love%1:12:00:: and hate .
The study---study%1:09:03:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: contributes to this control---control%1:04:02:: in a curious way---way%1:07:01:: .
William Wimsatt---person%1:03:00:: and Cleanth Brooks---person%1:03:00:: , it seems to me , have a penetrating insight---insight%1:09:02:: into the way---way%1:04:01:: in which this control---control%1:04:02:: is effected : `` For if we say poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: is to talk of beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: and love---love%1:12:00:: ( and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: or even an emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: of Platonic esteem---esteem%1:26:00:: ) and if it is to talk of anger---anger%1:12:00:: and murder---murder%1:04:00:: ( and yet not aim at arousing anger---anger%1:12:00:: and indignation---indignation%1:12:00:: ) - then it may be that the poetic way---way%1:04:01:: of dealing with these emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: will not be any kind---kind%1:09:00:: of intensification---intensification%1:04:00:: , compounding---compounding%1:04:00:: , or magnification---magnification%1:04:00:: , or any direct assault upon the affections---affection%1:12:00:: at all .
Something indirect , mixed , reconciling , tensional might well be the stratagem---stratagem%1:04:00:: , the devious technique---technique%1:09:00:: by which a poet---poet%1:18:00:: indulged in all kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of talk---talk%1:10:03:: about love---love%1:12:00:: and anger---anger%1:12:00:: and even in something like '' expressions---expression%1:10:04:: `` of these emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: , without aiming at their incitement---incitement%1:04:02:: or even uttering anything that essentially involves their incitement---incitement%1:04:02:: '' .
The rehearsal---rehearsal%1:04:01:: through literature---literature%1:10:00:: of emotional life---life%1:26:01:: under controlled conditions---condition%1:26:00:: may be a most valuable human experience---experience%1:09:01:: .
Here I do not mean catharsis---catharsis%1:04:00:: , the discharge---discharge%1:22:00:: of emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: .
I mean something more like Freud---person%1:03:00:: 's concept---concept%1:09:00:: of the utility---utility%1:07:00:: of `` play---play%1:04:06:: '' to a small child---child%1:18:00:: : he plays `` house---house%1:04:00:: '' or `` doctor---doctor%1:04:00:: '' or `` fireman---fireman%1:04:00:: '' as a way---way%1:04:01:: of mastering slightly frightening experiences---experience%1:11:00:: , reliving---reliving%1:09:00:: them imaginatively until they are under control---control%1:07:00:: .
There is a second feature---feature%1:09:00:: of the influences---influence%1:09:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: , good literature---literature%1:10:00:: , on emotional life---life%1:26:01:: which may have some special value---value%1:07:00:: for our time---time%1:28:00:: .
In B. M. Spinley---person%1:03:00:: 's portrayal---portrayal%1:10:01:: of the underprivileged and undereducated youth---youth%1:18:00:: of London---london%1:15:00:: , a salient finding---finding%1:04:00:: was the inability---inability%1:09:00:: to postpone gratification---gratification%1:04:00:: , a need---need%1:03:00:: to satisfy impulses---impulse%1:12:01:: immediately without the pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: of anticipation---anticipation%1:09:01:: or of savoring the experience---experience%1:11:00:: .
Perhaps it is only an analogy , but one of the most obvious differences---difference%1:07:00:: between cheap fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: and fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: of an enduring quality---quality%1:07:02:: is the development---development%1:04:01:: of a theme---theme%1:10:00:: or story---story%1:10:00:: with leisure---leisure%1:04:00:: and anticipation---anticipation%1:09:01:: .
Anyone who has watched children---child%1:18:00:: develop a taste---taste%1:12:02:: for literature---literature%1:10:00:: will understand what I mean .
It is at least possible that the capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: to postpone gratification---gratification%1:26:00:: is developed as well as expressed in a continuous and guided exposure---exposure%1:04:06:: to great literature---literature%1:10:00:: .
In any inquiry---inquiry%1:09:01:: into the way---way%1:04:01:: in which great literature---literature%1:10:00:: affects the emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: , particularly with respect to the sense---sense%1:09:05:: of harmony---harmony%1:07:01:: , or relief---relief%1:04:01:: of tension---tension%1:26:03:: , or sense---sense%1:09:05:: of `` a transformed inner nature---nature%1:07:02:: '' which may occur , a most careful exploration---exploration%1:04:00:: of the particular feature---feature%1:09:00:: of the experience---experience%1:09:01:: which produces the effect---effect%1:19:00:: would be required .
In the calm---calm%1:07:00:: which follows the reading---reading%1:09:00:: of a poem---poem%1:10:00:: , for example , is the effect---effect%1:19:00:: produced by the enforced quiet---quiet%1:07:02:: , by the musical quality---quality%1:07:01:: of words---words%1:10:02:: and rhythm---rhythm%1:10:00:: , by the sentiments---sentiment%1:12:00:: or sense---sense%1:10:00:: of the poem---poem%1:10:00:: , by the associations---association%1:09:00:: with earlier readings---reading%1:09:00:: , if it is familiar , by the boost---boost%1:04:00:: to the self-esteem---self-esteem%1:12:00:: for the semi-literate , by the diversion---diversion%1:04:01:: of attention---attention%1:09:00:: , by the sense---sense%1:09:05:: of security---security%1:26:00:: in a legitimized withdrawal---withdrawal%1:04:00:: , by a kind license---license%1:26:01:: for some variety of fantasy life---fantasy_life%1:09:00:: regarded as forbidden , or by half conscious ideas---idea%1:09:00:: about the magical power---magical_power%1:07:00:: of words---words%1:10:02:: ?
These are , if the research---research%1:04:00:: is done with subtlety---subtlety%1:10:00:: and skill---skill%1:09:00:: , researchable topics---topic%1:10:00:: , but the research---research%1:04:00:: is missing .
One of the most frequent views---view%1:09:02:: of the value---value%1:07:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: is the education---education%1:09:01:: of sensibility---sensibility%1:09:00:: that it is thought to provide .
Sensibility---sensibility%1:09:00:: is a vague word---word%1:10:00:: , covering an area---area%1:09:00:: of meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: rather than any precise talent---talent%1:09:00:: , quality---quality%1:07:00:: , or skill---skill%1:09:01:: .
Among other things it means perception---perception%1:09:00:: , discrimination---discrimination%1:09:00:: , sensitivity---sensitivity%1:09:00:: to subtle differences---difference%1:07:00:: .
Both the extent---extent%1:07:00:: to which this is true and the limits---limit%1:07:00:: of the field---field%1:09:00:: of perceptual skill---skill%1:09:01:: involved should be acknowledged .
Its truth---truth%1:07:01:: is illustrated by the skill---skill%1:09:01:: , sensitivity---sensitivity%1:09:00:: , and general expertise---expertise%1:09:00:: of the English professor---english_professor%1:18:00:: with whom one attends the theatre---theatre%1:06:00:: .
The limits---limit%1:07:00:: are suggested by an imaginary experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: : contrast the perceptual skill---skill%1:09:01:: of English professors---english_professor%1:18:00:: with that of their colleagues---colleague%1:18:01:: in discriminating among motor cars---motorcar%1:06:00:: , political candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: , or female beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: .
Along these lines---line%1:09:01:: , the particular point---point%1:09:01:: that sensitivity---sensitivity%1:09:00:: in literature---literature%1:10:00:: leads to sensitivity---sensitivity%1:09:00:: in human relations---relations%1:24:00:: would require more proof---proof%1:09:00:: than I have seen .
In a symposium---symposium%1:14:00:: and general exploration---exploration%1:04:00:: of the field---field%1:09:00:: of Person---person%1:03:00:: Perception---perception%1:09:01:: and Interpersonal Behavior---behavior%1:26:00:: the discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: does not touch upon this aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: of the subject---subject%1:10:00:: , with one possible exception---exception%1:09:00:: ; Solomon Asch---person%1:03:00:: shows the transcultural stability---stability%1:07:00:: of metaphors---metaphor%1:10:00:: based on sensation---sensation%1:09:00:: ( hot , sweet , bitter , etc . ) dealing with personal qualities---quality%1:07:00:: of human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: and events---event%1:03:00:: .
But to go from here to the belief---belief%1:09:01:: that those more sensitive to metaphor---metaphor%1:10:00:: and language---language%1:10:00:: will also be more sensitive to personal differences---difference%1:07:00:: is too great an inferential leap---leap%1:11:00:: .
I would say , too , that the study---study%1:09:03:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: tends to give a person---person%1:03:00:: what I shall call depth---depth%1:07:01:: .
I use this term---term%1:10:00:: to mean three things---thing%1:07:00:: : a search---search%1:04:02:: for the human significance---significance%1:09:01:: of an event---event%1:03:00:: or state of affairs---state_of_affairs%1:26:00:: , a tendency---tendency%1:09:00:: to look at wholes---whole%1:09:00:: rather than parts---part%1:17:00:: , and a tendency---tendency%1:09:00:: to respond to these events---event%1:03:00:: and wholes---whole%1:09:00:: with feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: .
It is the obverse---obverse%1:09:00:: of triviality---triviality%1:07:00:: , shallowness---shallowness%1:07:01:: , emotional anaesthesia---anaesthesia%1:26:00:: .
I think these attributes---attribute%1:09:00:: cluster , but I have no evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: .
In fact , I can only say this seems to me to follow from a wide , continuous , and properly guided exposure---exposure%1:04:06:: to literary art---art%1:06:00:: .
From its inception---inception%1:11:00:: in 1920 with the passage---passage%1:04:01:: of Public Law---public_law%1:10:00:: 236 , 66 th Congress---group%1:03:00:: , the purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of the vocational rehabilitation program---rehabilitation_program%1:09:00:: has been to assist the States---state%1:15:01:: , by means---means%1:04:00:: of grants-in-aid---grant-in-aid%1:04:00:: , to return disabled men---man%1:18:00:: and women---woman%1:18:00:: to productive , gainful employment---employment%1:26:00:: .
The authority---authority%1:07:02:: for the program---program%1:09:01:: was renewed several times---time%1:11:00:: until the vocational rehabilitation program---rehabilitation_program%1:09:00:: was made permanent as Title---title%1:10:05:: 5 , of the Social Security Act in 1935 .
Up to this time---time%1:11:00:: and for the next eight years---year%1:28:01:: , the services---services%1:04:00:: provided disabled persons---person%1:03:00:: consisted mainly of training---training%1:04:00:: , counseling---counseling%1:10:00:: , and placement---placement%1:04:01:: on a job---job%1:04:00:: .
Recognizing the limitations---limitation%1:07:00:: of such a program---program%1:09:01:: , the 78 th Congress---group%1:03:00:: in 1943 passed P. L.---public_law%1:10:00:: 113 , which broadened the concept---concept%1:09:00:: of rehabilitation---rehabilitation%1:04:01:: to include the provision---provision%1:04:01:: of physical restoration---restoration%1:04:00:: services---services%1:04:00:: to remove or reduce disabilities---disability%1:26:00:: , and which revised the financing---financing%1:04:00:: structure---structure%1:06:00:: .
Despite the successful rehabilitation---rehabilitation%1:04:01:: of over a half million disabled persons---person%1:03:00:: in the first eleven years---year%1:28:01:: after 1943 , the existing program---program%1:09:01:: was still seen to be inadequate to cope with the nation---nation%1:14:00:: 's backlog---backlog%1:14:00:: of an estimated two million disabled---disabled%1:14:00:: .
To assist the States---state%1:15:01:: , therefore , in rehabilitating handicapped individuals---individual%1:03:00:: , `` so that they may prepare for and engage in remunerative employment---employment%1:26:00:: to the extent---extent%1:26:00:: of their capabilities---capability%1:07:00:: '' , the 83 rd Congress---group%1:03:00:: enacted the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 ( P. L.---public_law%1:10:00:: 565 ) .
These amendments---amendment%1:04:00:: to the Vocational Rehabilitation Act were designed to help provide for more specialized rehabilitation---rehabilitation%1:04:01:: facilities---facility%1:06:00:: , for more sheltered---sheltered_workshop%1:06:00:: and `` half-way '' workshops---workshop%1:06:00:: , for greater numbers---number%1:23:00:: of adequately trained personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: , for more comprehensive services---services%1:04:00:: to individuals---individual%1:03:00:: ( particularly to the homebound---homebound%1:14:00:: and the blind---blind%1:14:00:: ) , and for other administrative improvements---improvement%1:04:00:: to increase the program---program%1:09:01:: 's overall effectiveness---effectiveness%1:07:00:: .
Under the law---law%1:10:00:: as it existed until 1943 , the Federal Government---federal_government%1:14:00:: made grants---grant%1:04:00:: to the States---state%1:15:01:: on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of population---population%1:23:00:: , matching State expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: on a 50 - 50 basis---basis%1:24:00:: .
Under P. L.---public_law%1:10:00:: 113 , 78 th Congress---group%1:03:00:: , the Federal Government---federal_government%1:14:00:: assumed responsibility---responsibility%1:26:00:: for 100 % of necessary State expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: in connection with administration---administration%1:04:00:: and the counseling---counseling%1:10:00:: and placement---placement%1:04:01:: of the disabled---disabled%1:14:00:: , and for 50 % of the necessary costs---cost%1:21:00:: of providing clients---client%1:18:00:: with rehabilitation---rehabilitation%1:04:01:: case---case%1:18:03:: services---services%1:04:00:: .
Throughout these years---year%1:28:01:: , the statutory authorization---authorization%1:10:00:: was for such sums---sum%1:21:00:: as were necessary to carry out the provisions---provision%1:10:00:: of the Act .
The 1954 Amendments completely changed the financing of the vocational rehabilitation program , providing for a three part grant---grant%1:21:00:: structure - for ( 1 ) basic support ; ( 2 ) extension and improvement ; and ( 3 ) research , demonstrations , training and traineeships for vocational rehabilitation - and in addition for short-term training and instruction .
The 1954 Amendments---amendment%1:10:00:: completely changed the financing---financing%1:04:00:: of the vocational rehabilitation program---vocational_rehabilitation_program%1:09:00:: , providing for a three part---part%1:09:00:: grant---grant%1:04:00:: structure---structure%1:06:00:: - for ( 1 ) basic support---support%1:04:04:: ; ( 2 ) extension---extension%1:04:02:: and improvement---improvement%1:04:00:: ; and ( 3 ) research---research%1:04:00:: , demonstrations---demonstration%1:04:00:: , training---training%1:04:00:: and traineeships---traineeship%1:21:00:: for vocational rehabilitation---vocational_rehabilitation%1:04:00:: - and in addition for short-term training---training%1:04:00:: and instruction---instruction%1:04:01:: .
The first part---part%1:09:00:: of the new structure---structure%1:06:00:: - that for supporting the basic program---program%1:09:01:: of vocational rehabilitation---vocational_rehabilitation%1:04:00:: services---services%1:04:00:: - is described in this Section---section%1:10:00:: .
Subsequent sections on grants---grant%1:21:00:: describe the other categories of the grant structure .
Subsequent sections---section%1:10:00:: on grants---grant%1:04:00:: describe the other categories---category%1:14:00:: of the grant---grant%1:04:00:: structure---structure%1:06:00:: .
The following table---table%1:14:00:: shows , for selected years---year%1:28:01:: , the authorizations---authorization%1:10:00:: , appropriations---appropriation%1:21:00:: , allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: base---base%1:10:01:: , Federal grants---grant%1:21:00:: to States---state%1:15:01:: and State matching funds---matching_funds%1:21:00:: for this part---part%1:09:00:: of the grant---grant%1:04:00:: program---program%1:09:01:: .
In order to assist the States---state%1:15:01:: in maintaining basic vocational rehabilitation---vocational_rehabilitation%1:04:00:: services---services%1:04:00:: , Section---section%1:10:00:: 2 of the amended Act provides that allotments---allotment%1:21:00:: to States---state%1:15:01:: for support---support%1:04:04:: of such services---services%1:04:00:: be based on ( 1 ) need---need%1:26:00:: , as measured by a State---state%1:15:01:: 's population---population%1:14:00:: , and ( 2 ) fiscal capacity---capacity%1:04:00:: , as measured by its per capita income---income%1:21:00:: .
The Act further provides for a `` floor---floor%1:10:00:: '' or minimum allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: , set at the 1954 level---level%1:26:00:: , which is called the `` base---base%1:10:01:: '' allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: , and a `` ceiling---ceiling%1:10:00:: '' or maximum allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: , for each State---state%1:15:01:: .
It stipulates , in addition , that all amounts---amount%1:21:00:: remaining as a result of imposing the `` ceiling---ceiling%1:10:00:: '' , and not used for insuring the `` floor---floor%1:10:00:: '' , be redistributed to those States---state%1:15:01:: still below their maximums---maximum%1:23:00:: .
These provisions---provision%1:10:00:: are designed to reflect the differences---difference%1:07:00:: in wealth---wealth%1:26:00:: and population---population%1:14:00:: among the States---state%1:15:01:: , with the objective---objective%1:09:00:: that a vocationally handicapped person---person%1:03:00:: have access---access%1:07:01:: to needed services---services%1:04:00:: regardless of whether he resides in a State---state%1:15:01:: with a low or high per capita income---income%1:21:00:: or a sparsely or thickly populated State---state%1:15:01:: .
The provisions---provision%1:10:00:: are also designed to avoid disruption---disruption%1:04:02:: in State programs---program%1:09:01:: already in operation , which might otherwise result from the allotment---allotment%1:04:00:: of funds---funds%1:21:00:: on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of wealth---wealth%1:26:00:: and population---population%1:14:00:: alone .
The method---method%1:09:00:: used in computing the allotments---allotment%1:21:00:: is specifically set forth in the Act .
The term---term%1:10:00:: `` State---state%1:15:01:: '' means the several States---state%1:15:01:: , the District of Columbia---district_of_columbia%1:15:00:: , the Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , Guam---guam%1:15:00:: and Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: ; the term---term%1:10:00:: `` United States---united_states%1:15:00:: '' includes the several States---state%1:15:01:: and the District of Columbia---district_of_columbia%1:15:00:: , and excludes the Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , Guam---guam%1:15:00:: and Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: and Hawaii---hawaii%1:15:00:: .
The following steps---step%1:04:02:: are employed in calculations---calculation%1:09:00:: :
For each State---state%1:15:01:: ( except Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: , Guam---guam%1:15:00:: , the Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: and Hawaii---hawaii%1:15:00:: ) determine average per capita income---income%1:21:00:: based on the last three years---year%1:28:01:: .
( See Source of Data , below for per capita income---income%1:21:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: to be used in this step---step%1:04:02:: . )
Determine the average per capita income---income%1:21:00:: for the U. S.---u.s.%1:15:00:: based on the last three years---year%1:28:01:: .
( See Source---source%1:10:00:: of Data---data%1:14:00:: , below , for per capita income---income%1:21:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: to be used in this step---step%1:04:02:: . )
Determine the ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: of 50---50%1:23:00:: % to the average per capita income---income%1:21:00:: of the U. S.---u.s.%1:15:00:: ( Divide 50---50%1:23:00:: by the result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 2 above . )
Determine for each State---state%1:15:01:: ( except the Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , Guam---guam%1:15:00:: and Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: and Hawaii---hawaii%1:15:00:: ) that percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: which bears the same ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: to 50---50%1:23:00:: % as the particular State---state%1:15:01:: 's average per capita income---income%1:21:00:: bears to the average per capita income---income%1:21:00:: of the U. S.---u.s.%1:15:00:: .
( Multiply the result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 3 above by the result---result%1:10:00:: obtained for each State---state%1:15:01:: in item---item%1:10:00:: 1 above . )
Determine the particular State---state%1:15:01:: 's `` allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: '' .
By law---law%1:10:00:: this is 75 % for the Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , Guam---guam%1:15:00:: and Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: .
( Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: and Hawaii---hawaii%1:15:00:: had fixed allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: percentages---percentage%1:24:00:: in effect prior to fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: 1962 . )
In all other States---state%1:15:01:: it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100---100%1:23:00:: the result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 4 above ; except that no State---state%1:15:01:: shall have an allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: less than 33 - 1 3 % nor more than 75 % .
If the resulting difference for the particular State---state%1:15:01:: is less or more than these extremes---extreme%1:07:00:: , the State---state%1:15:01:: 's allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme---extreme%1:07:00:: .
Square each State---state%1:15:01:: 's allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: .
Determine each State---state%1:15:01:: 's population---population%1:14:00:: .
( See Source---source%1:10:00:: of Data---data%1:14:00:: , below for population---population%1:14:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: to be used in this step---step%1:04:02:: . )
Multiply the population---population%1:14:00:: of each State---state%1:15:01:: by the square---square%1:23:00:: of its allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: .
( Multiply result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 7 above , by result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 6 above . )
Determine the sum---sum%1:09:01:: of the products---product%1:09:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 8 above , for all the States---state%1:15:01:: .
( For each State---state%1:15:01:: , make all computations---computation%1:04:00:: set forth in items---item%1:10:00:: 1 to 8 above , and then add the results---result%1:10:00:: obtained for each State---state%1:15:01:: in item---item%1:10:00:: 8 . )
Determine the ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: that the amount---amount%1:21:00:: being allotted is to the sum---sum%1:09:01:: of the products---product%1:09:00:: for all the States---state%1:15:01:: .
( Divide the amount---amount%1:21:00:: being allotted by the result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 9 above . )
Determine the particular State---state%1:15:01:: 's unadjusted allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: for the particular fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: .
( Multiply the State---state%1:15:01:: product---product%1:09:00:: in item---item%1:10:00:: 8 above by the result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 10 above . )
Determine if the particular State---state%1:15:01:: 's unadjusted allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: ( result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 11 above ) is greater than its maximum allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: , and if so lower its unadjusted allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: to its maximum allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: .
( Each State---state%1:15:01:: 's unadjusted allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: for any fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: , which exceeds its minimum allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: described in item---item%1:10:00:: 13 below by a percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: greater than one and one-half times---times%1:04:00:: the percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: by which the sum---sum%1:21:00:: being allotted exceeds $ 23000000 , must be reduced by the amount---amount%1:21:00:: of the excess---excess%1:07:02:: . )
Determine if the particular State---state%1:15:01:: 's unadjusted allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: ( result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 11 above ) is less than its minimum ( base ) allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: , and if so raise its unadjusted allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: to its minimum allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: .
Regardless of its unadjusted allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: , each State---state%1:15:01:: is guaranteed by law---law%1:10:00:: a minimum allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: each year equal to the allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: which it received in fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: 1954 - increased by a uniform percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of 5.4865771 which brings total 1954 allotments---allotment%1:21:00:: to all States---state%1:15:01:: up to $ 23000000 .
The funds---funds%1:21:00:: recouped by reductions---reduction%1:04:00:: in item---item%1:10:00:: 12 above are used : first , to increase the unadjusted allotments---allotment%1:21:00:: to the specified minimum---minimum%1:23:00:: in those States---state%1:15:01:: where the unadjusted allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: is less than the minimum allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: ( item---item%1:10:00:: 13 above ) ; and second , to increase uniformly the allotments---allotment%1:21:00:: to those States---state%1:15:01:: whose allotments---allotment%1:21:00:: are below their maximums---maximum%1:23:00:: , with adjustments---adjustment%1:04:00:: to prevent the allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: of any State---state%1:15:01:: from thereby exceeding its maximum---maximum%1:23:00:: .
For the States---state%1:15:01:: which maintain two separate agencies---agency%1:14:00:: - one for the vocational rehabilitation---rehabilitation%1:04:01:: of the blind---blind%1:14:00:: , and one for the rehabilitation---rehabilitation%1:04:01:: of persons---person%1:03:00:: other than the blind---blind%1:14:00:: - the Act specifies that their minimum ( base ) allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: shall be divided between the two agencies---agency%1:14:00:: in the same proportion---proportion%1:24:00:: as it was divided in fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: 1954 .
Funds---funds%1:21:00:: allotted in addition to their minimum allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: are apportioned to the two agencies---agency%1:14:00:: as they may determine .
As is the case---case%1:09:00:: with the allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: provisions---provision%1:10:00:: for support---support%1:04:04:: of vocational rehabilitation---rehabilitation%1:04:01:: services---services%1:04:00:: , the matching requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: are also based on a statutory formula---formula%1:10:00:: .
Prior to 1960 , in order to provide matching---matching_funds%1:21:00:: for the minimum ( base ) allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: , State funds---funds%1:21:00:: had to equal 1954 State funds---funds%1:21:00:: .
Prior to and since 1960 the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the support---support%1:04:04:: allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: is matched at rates---rate%1:21:00:: related to the fiscal capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: of the State---state%1:15:01:: , with a pivot of 40 % State ( or 60 % Federal ) participation---participation%1:04:00:: in total program---program%1:09:01:: costs---cost%1:21:00:: .
The percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of Federal participation---participation%1:04:00:: in such costs---cost%1:21:00:: for any State---state%1:15:01:: is referred to in the law---law%1:14:00:: as that State---state%1:15:01:: 's `` Federal share---share%1:21:00:: '' .
For purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: of this explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: , this percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: is referred to as the States---state%1:15:01:: `` unadjusted Federal share---share%1:21:00:: '' .
Beginning in 1960 , the matching requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: for the base allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: are being adjusted ( upward or downward , as required ) 25---25%1:23:00:: % a year , so that by 1963 the entire support---support%1:04:04:: allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: will be matched on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of a 40 % pivot State share---share%1:21:00:: , with maximum and minimum State shares---share%1:21:00:: of 50---50%1:23:00:: % and 30---30%1:23:00:: % , respectively .
The pre 1960 rate---rate%1:21:00:: of Federal participation---participation%1:04:00:: with respect to any State---state%1:15:01:: 's base allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: , as well as the adjusted rate---rate%1:21:00:: in effect during the 1960 - 1962 period---period%1:28:00:: , is designated by the statute---statute%1:10:00:: as that State---state%1:15:01:: 's `` adjusted Federal Share---share%1:21:00:: '' .
The provisions---provision%1:10:00:: for determining a State---state%1:15:01:: 's unadjusted Federal share---share%1:21:00:: are designed to reflect the varying financial resources---resource%1:21:00:: among the States---state%1:15:01:: .
The purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of the adjusted Federal share---share%1:21:00:: relating to the base allotment---allotment%1:21:00:: and of the transition---transition%1:11:00:: provisions---provision%1:10:00:: for reaching the unadjusted Federal share---share%1:21:00:: is to prevent dislocations---dislocation%1:11:00:: from abrupt changes in matching rates---rate%1:21:00:: .
The method---method%1:09:00:: used for computing the respective Federal and State shares---share%1:21:00:: in total program---program%1:09:01:: costs---cost%1:21:00:: is specifically set forth in the Act .
The term---term%1:10:00:: `` State---state%1:15:01:: '' means the several States---state%1:15:01:: , the District of Columbia---district_of_columbia%1:15:00:: , the Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , Guam---guam%1:15:00:: and Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: ; the term---term%1:10:00:: `` United States---united_states%1:15:00:: '' includes the several States---state%1:15:01:: and the District of Columbia---district_of_columbia%1:15:00:: and excludes the Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , Guam---guam%1:15:00:: and Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: and Hawaii---hawaii%1:15:00:: .
The following steps---step%1:04:02:: are employed in the calculations---calculation%1:09:00:: :
For each State---state%1:15:01:: ( except the Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , Guam---guam%1:15:00:: , Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: and Hawaii---hawaii%1:15:00:: ) , determine the average per capita income---income%1:21:00:: for the last three years---year%1:28:01:: .
( the same amount---amount%1:21:00:: used in item---item%1:10:00:: 1 under Method---method%1:09:00:: of Computing allotments---allotment%1:21:00:: , above . )
Determine the average per capita income---income%1:21:00:: for the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: for the last three years---year%1:28:01:: .
( The same amount---amount%1:21:00:: used in item---item%1:10:00:: 2 under Method---method%1:09:00:: of Computing Allotments---allotment%1:21:00:: , above . )
Determine the ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: of 40---40%1:23:00:: % to the average per capita income---income%1:21:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
( Divide 40---40%1:23:00:: by the amount---amount%1:21:00:: used in item---item%1:10:00:: 2 above . )
Determine for each State---state%1:15:01:: ( except the Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , Guam---guam%1:15:00:: , Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: , and , prior to 1962 , Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: and hawaii---hawaii%1:15:00:: ) , that percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: which bears the same ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: to 40---40%1:23:00:: % as the particular State---state%1:15:01:: 's average per capita income---income%1:21:00:: bears to the average per capita income---income%1:21:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
( Multiply the result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 3 above by the amount---amount%1:21:00:: used for each State---state%1:15:01:: in item---item%1:10:00:: 1 above . )
Determine the particular State---state%1:15:01:: 's `` Federal Share---share%1:21:00:: '' .
By law---law%1:10:00:: this is 70---70%1:23:00:: % for the Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , Guam---guam%1:15:00:: and Puerto Rico---puerto_rico%1:15:00:: .
( Alaska---alaska%1:15:00:: and Hawaii---hawaii%1:15:00:: had fixed Federal share---share%1:21:00:: percentages---percentage%1:24:00:: in effect prior to fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: 1962 . )
In all other States---state%1:15:01:: it is the difference obtained by subtracting from 100---100%1:23:00:: the result---result%1:10:00:: obtained in item---item%1:10:00:: 4 above ; except that no State---state%1:15:01:: shall have a Federal share---share%1:21:00:: less than 50---50%1:23:00:: % nor more than 70 % .
If the resulting difference for the particular State---state%1:15:01:: is less or more than these extremes---extreme%1:07:00:: , the State---state%1:15:01:: 's Federal share---share%1:21:00:: must be raised or lowered to the appropriate extreme---extreme%1:07:00:: .
Spencer---person%1:03:00:: said nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
`` Is there any word---word%1:10:03:: you would like to offer in your own defense---defense%1:10:00:: '' ?
Spencer---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
Alexander---person%1:03:00:: said , `` Answer---answer%1:10:00:: me properly , Spencer---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Spencer---person%1:03:00:: was quiet for a moment---moment%1:28:00:: longer , then he said , `` There is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: I want to say , Captain---captain%1:18:04:: '' .
Alexander---person%1:03:00:: walked away .
Naval procedure---procedure%1:04:02:: , he thought , had its moments---moment%1:28:00:: of grim humor---humor%1:07:01:: .
Philip Spencer---person%1:03:00:: had cold-bloodedly planned the murder---murder%1:04:00:: of his captain---captain%1:18:02:: , yet it seemed in order to chide him for a lapse---lapse%1:04:00:: of proper address---address%1:10:03:: .
During the morning hours---hour%1:28:01:: , it became clear that the arrest---arrest%1:04:00:: of Spencer---person%1:03:00:: was having no sobering effect---effect%1:19:00:: upon the men---man%1:18:03:: of the Somers .
Those named in the Greek paper---paper%1:10:03:: were manufacturing reasons---reason%1:16:00:: to steal aft under pretence---pretence%1:07:01:: of some call---call%1:10:05:: of duty---duty%1:04:00:: , so as to be near Spencer---person%1:03:00:: , watching an opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to communicate with him .
Hostile glances---glance%1:04:00:: were flashed at both Alexander---person%1:03:00:: and Gansevoort---person%1:03:00:: .
The two---two%1:23:00:: met in the Captain---captain%1:18:02:: 's cabin---cabin%1:06:01:: .
`` What is the next step---step%1:04:02:: , Captain---captain%1:18:02:: '' ?
`` More arrests---arrest%1:04:00:: , I fear '' .
In your opinion---opinion%1:10:01:: , who is this E. Andrews---person%1:03:00:: on the ' certain ' list---list%1:10:00:: `` ?
`` Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: , of course .
He is the oldest and most experienced of the lot---lot%1:14:00:: .
He saw the dangers---danger%1:04:00:: , not the glories---glory%1:26:00:: of being identified as a mutineer---mutineer%1:18:00:: .
Somehow he talked Spencer---person%1:03:00:: into letting him use another name---name%1:10:00:: '' .
There was a tap---tap%1:11:00:: at the door---door%1:06:01:: and Oliver---person%1:03:00:: entered with the word---word%1:10:03:: that Heiser---person%1:03:00:: wished to see the Captain---captain%1:18:02:: .
Heiser---person%1:03:00:: , breathless and wild-eyed , brought the chilling news---news%1:10:00:: that the handspikes---handspike%1:06:00:: , heavers---heaver%1:06:00:: and holystones---holystone%1:17:00:: had been mysteriously removed from their customary places---place%1:15:00:: .
`` And also , sir---sir%1:18:00:: , two articles---article%1:03:00:: which were considered souvenirs---souvenir%1:06:00:: now must be regarded in another light---light%1:09:01:: entirely .
An African knife---knife%1:06:01:: and battle-ax---battle-ax%1:06:00:: are at this moment---moment%1:28:00:: being sharpened by McKinley---person%1:03:00:: and Green---person%1:03:00:: .
McKinley---person%1:03:00:: was overheard to say that he would like to get the knife---knife%1:06:01:: into Spencer---person%1:03:00:: 's possession---possession%1:04:00:: and that '' -
`` Where did you gather all this information---information%1:09:00:: , Heiser---person%1:03:00:: ?
Who reported to you the disappearance---disappearance%1:04:00:: of handspikes---handspike%1:06:00:: and heavers---heaver%1:06:00:: and who '' -
He was interrupted by a crash---crash%1:11:01:: from the deck---deck%1:06:00:: and sprang toward the ladder---ladder%1:06:00:: , with Gansevoort---person%1:03:00:: and Heiser---person%1:03:00:: behind him .
A glance---glance%1:04:00:: revealed that the main topgallant mast---topgallant_mast%1:06:00:: had been carried away .
The aimless milling about of what had been a well trained , well organized crew---crew%1:14:01:: struck Alexander---person%1:03:00:: with horror---horror%1:12:00:: .
He bellowed orders---order%1:10:03:: and watched the alert response---response%1:04:01:: of some of his men---man%1:18:03:: and watched , too , the way---way%1:07:01:: a dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: or more turned their heads---head%1:08:00:: questioningly toward the shackled figure---figure%1:08:00:: as though for further instruction---instruction%1:10:04:: .
Adrien Deslonde---person%1:03:00:: hastened to Alexander---person%1:03:00:: 's side---side%1:08:00:: .
`` Small---person%1:03:00:: violently jerked the weather royal brace---royal_brace%1:06:00:: with full intention---intention%1:09:00:: to carry away the mast---mast%1:06:00:: .
I saw him myself and it was done after consultation---consultation%1:10:00:: with Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: .
I swear it , sir---sir%1:18:00:: '' .
And it was clear that Adrien---person%1:03:00:: was not mistaken , for both Small---person%1:03:00:: and Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: took no step---step%1:04:02:: toward aiding in the sending---sending%1:04:00:: up of the new topgallant mast---topgallant_mast%1:06:00:: till Philip Spencer---person%1:03:00:: had given the signal---signal%1:10:00:: to obey .
Then , with disappointment---disappointment%1:12:00:: evident upon their faces---face%1:07:00:: , they moved to the work---work%1:04:00:: .
Alexander---person%1:03:00:: guessed that they had planned confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: and turmoil---turmoil%1:26:00:: , thinking it the ideal climate---climate%1:26:00:: in which to begin battle---battle%1:04:00:: and bloodshed---bloodshed%1:04:01:: .
Their strategy---strategy%1:09:00:: was sound enough and , he reasoned , had been defeated only by Philip Spencer---person%1:03:00:: 's unwillingness---unwillingness%1:07:00:: to sanction an idea---idea%1:09:00:: he had not originated .
When the mast---mast%1:06:00:: was raised , Alexander---person%1:03:00:: gave the order---order%1:10:03:: for Small---person%1:03:00:: and Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: to be placed under arrest---arrest%1:04:00:: , and now three figures---figure%1:08:00:: in irons---irons%1:06:00:: sprawled upon the open deck---deck%1:06:00:: and terror---terror%1:12:00:: stalked the Somers .
Spencer---person%1:03:00:: 's potential followers---follower%1:18:00:: were openly sullen and morose , missing muster without excuse---excuse%1:10:00:: , expressing in ominous tones---tone%1:10:01:: their displeasure---displeasure%1:12:00:: at the prisoners---prisoner%1:18:00:: being kept in irons---irons%1:06:00:: , communicating with the three---three%1:23:00:: by glance---glance%1:04:00:: and signal---signal%1:10:00:: .
One of the missing handspikes---handspike%1:06:00:: came out of its hiding place---hiding_place%1:15:00:: after Midshipman Tillotson---person%1:03:00:: had been insolently disobeyed by Seaman Wilson---person%1:03:00:: .
Tillotson---person%1:03:00:: had reported the man---man%1:18:03:: to Gansevoort---person%1:03:00:: and an hour---hour%1:28:00:: later , with back---back%1:08:00:: turned , had been attacked by Wilson---person%1:03:00:: , brandishing the weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: , shackled and snarling , was thrown with the other prisoners---prisoner%1:18:00:: and was soon joined by Green---person%1:03:00:: , McKee---person%1:03:00:: and McKinley---person%1:03:00:: .
Not a man---man%1:18:03:: on the brig---brig%1:06:01:: , loyal or villainous , could be unaffected by the sight---sight%1:09:01:: of seven men---man%1:18:03:: involved in the crime---crime%1:04:00:: of mutiny---mutiny%1:04:00:: .
In the tiny cabin---cabin%1:06:01:: , Alexander---person%1:03:00:: met with Gansevoort---person%1:03:00:: , Heiser---person%1:03:00:: and Wales---person%1:03:00:: to speak and to listen .
Three days---day%1:28:01:: had passed since Spencer---person%1:03:00:: 's arrest---arrest%1:04:00:: and each day---day%1:28:03:: had brought new dangers---danger%1:04:00:: , new fears---fear%1:12:00:: .
Gansevoort---person%1:03:00:: said , `` It requires an omniscient eye---eye%1:08:00:: to select those if any on whom we can now rely .
To have the Greek paper---paper%1:10:03:: is not the great help---help%1:04:00:: that at first flush---flush%1:28:00:: it seemed .
From actions---action%1:04:02:: aboard , it is easy to guess that Spencer---person%1:03:00:: 's boast---boast%1:10:00:: of twenty staunch followers---follower%1:18:00:: was a modest estimate---estimate%1:10:01:: '' .
`` Well '' , Heiser---person%1:03:00:: ventured , `` why do n't we hold an investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: with questioning---questioning%1:10:00:: and '' -
`` That would be worse than useless '' , Alexander---person%1:03:00:: broke in .
`` There is not space---space%1:15:00:: to hold or force---force%1:07:01:: to guard any increased number---number%1:07:00:: of prisoners---prisoner%1:18:00:: .
Besides , suppose we hold a court---court%1:14:00:: of inquiry---inquiry%1:04:00:: , then what ?
Then we have informed a large number---large_number%1:23:00:: of our crew---crew%1:14:01:: that when they reach the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: , they will be punished but that in the meanwhile , they may run loose and are expected to perform their jobs---job%1:04:01:: in good order .
Mr. Heiser---person%1:03:00:: , does this sound like a truly workable plan---plan%1:09:00:: to you ?
Do you not think these men---man%1:18:03:: might choose the black flag---black_flag%1:06:00:: here and now---here_and_now%1:28:00:: '' ?
Wales---person%1:03:00:: said , `` Of course they would .
They are about to do so at any moment---moment%1:28:00:: as it is .
All that is needed is for one man---man%1:18:03:: to feel self-confident enough to take the lead---lead%1:04:01:: .
As soon as that one man---man%1:18:03:: is appointed by himself or the others or by a signal---signal%1:10:00:: from Spencer---person%1:03:00:: , we are going to be rushed .
We are going to be rushed and murdered---murder%1:04:00:: '' .
`` That is extravagant language---language%1:10:00:: , Mr. Wales---person%1:03:00:: .
We are not going to be rushed and murdered---murder%1:04:00:: '' , Alexander---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` We are going to bring the Somers into New York---new_york%1:15:01:: harbor---harbor%1:15:00:: safe and sound '' .
`` Of course , I agree with the Captain---captain%1:18:02:: '' , Gansevoort---person%1:03:00:: said thoughtfully , `` but the conspiracy---conspiracy%1:14:00:: is ferocious and desperate .
The instinct---instinct%1:09:00:: of discipline---discipline%1:07:00:: has been lost .
Anything is possible when anarchy---anarchy%1:26:00:: has the upper hand---upper_hand%1:07:00:: '' .
He paused , then added , `` Everything on a ship---ship%1:06:00:: is a weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: .
Implements---implement%1:06:00:: of wood---wood%1:27:00:: and iron---iron%1:27:00:: are available for close and hasty combat---combat%1:04:00:: no matter where a man---man%1:18:03:: stands .
Alexander---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Under arms day---day%1:28:02:: and night---night%1:28:00:: , watch---watch%1:28:00:: and watch---watch%1:28:00:: about .
Those of us present , the Perry---person%1:03:00:: brothers---brother%1:18:00:: , Deslonde---person%1:03:00:: and the other midshipmen---midshipman%1:18:00:: now have the responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: of the Somers .
A great deal---great_deal%1:23:00:: of labor---labor%1:04:00:: we have as well , for we are too uncertain of where trust---trust%1:09:00:: may be placed '' .
And when he was alone again in the cabin---cabin%1:06:01:: , Alexander---person%1:03:00:: lowered his head---head%1:08:00:: into his arms---arm%1:08:00:: and wept , for he knew full well what must be done , what in the end would be done .
With all his heart---heart%1:09:00:: he had loved the Navy---navy%1:14:00:: and now he must act in accordance---accordance%1:10:00:: with the Navy---navy%1:14:00:: 's implacable laws---law%1:14:00:: .
And when he did , when he gave to his ship---ship%1:06:00:: that protection---protection%1:04:00:: necessary to preserve her honor---honor%1:07:00:: , he knew he would lose forever the Navy---navy%1:14:00:: to which he had dedicated his soul---soul%1:18:00:: .
He who had tried so hard , who had yearned so passionately to be a great officer---officer%1:18:04:: .
It came to him as he wept there aboard the Somers that it was as foolish to strive for greatness---greatness%1:07:00:: as to seek to storm the gates---gate%1:06:00:: of heaven .
One did one 's best---best%1:04:00:: and if fortune---fortune%1:19:00:: smiled , there was a reward---reward%1:11:00:: .
One did one 's best---best%1:04:00:: and if fortune---fortune%1:19:00:: frowned , an eighteen year---year%1:28:01:: old boy---boy%1:18:00:: with murder---murder%1:04:00:: in his heart---heart%1:09:00:: sailed aboard one 's ship---ship%1:06:00:: .
And Alexander---person%1:03:00:: sobbed like a girl---girl%1:18:02:: for the dreams---dream%1:12:00:: he had had , and he felt no shame---shame%1:12:00:: .
God knew his tears---tear%1:08:01:: were his to shed if he so desired , for it had not been with an egotist---egotist%1:18:00:: 's rage---rage%1:26:02:: for fame---fame%1:26:01:: that he had held precious his naval career---career%1:04:00:: .
Another field---field%1:26:00:: had given him fame---fame%1:26:01:: enough to satisfy any egotist---egotist%1:18:00:: .
It was for love---love%1:12:00:: that he had served the Navy---navy%1:14:00:: .
To have someday that love---love%1:12:00:: returned was what he had lived for .
Now the hope---hope%1:12:01:: was gone .
Yes , he would bring the Somers safely into New York---new_york%1:15:01:: harbor---harbor%1:15:00:: but at a price---price%1:07:02:: .
Dear God , at what a price---price%1:07:02:: .
And after a while---while%1:28:00:: , he dried his tears---tear%1:08:01:: and walked the deck---deck%1:06:00:: as a captain---captain%1:18:02:: should with assurance---assurance%1:09:00:: and dignity---dignity%1:07:01:: .
Stern faced , he inspected the prisoners---prisoner%1:18:00:: , satisfying himself that they were clean , well fed and comfortable within reason .
The prisoners---prisoner%1:18:00:: averted their eyes---eye%1:08:00:: but not before he had glimpsed hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: and anger---anger%1:12:00:: .
Only Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: , the giant boatswain---boatswain%1:18:00:: , was mild-mannered and respectful .
He said , `` Captain---captain%1:18:02:: , may I speak , please ?
Captain---captain%1:18:02:: , I am innocent of any plot---plot%1:09:00:: against you or the ship---ship%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Are you , Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` Yes , sir---sir%1:18:00:: .
Before God---god%1:18:00:: I swear I am innocent .
I know nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: of any plot---plot%1:09:00:: , if there is such a thing---thing%1:26:00:: '' .
`` You are the only man---man%1:18:03:: aboard who can be in doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: '' .
`` I cannot speak for others , sir---sir%1:18:00:: , but I am innocent '' .
He leaned closer to Alexander---person%1:03:00:: , squinting up at him from the deck---deck%1:06:00:: .
`` Surely , Captain---captain%1:18:02:: , you did not find my name---name%1:10:00:: on any suspicious paper---paper%1:10:00:: or anything '' .
`` No , Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: , I did not find your name---name%1:10:00:: .
Now Spencer---person%1:03:00:: , seeming with effort---effort%1:04:01:: to shake himself from lethargy---lethargy%1:26:00:: , spoke .
He said , `` Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: is telling you the truth---truth%1:10:00:: .
Alexander---person%1:03:00:: shifted his gaze---gaze%1:04:00:: to Spencer---person%1:03:00:: .
The calmness---calmness%1:07:00:: and detachment---detachment%1:12:00:: of his tone---tone%1:10:01:: suggested unawareness---unawareness%1:09:00:: of how implicit was his own guilt---guilt%1:26:00:: in the words---words%1:10:03:: he had used to defend Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: .
Alexander---person%1:03:00:: knew Spencer---person%1:03:00:: too well to think him naive or thick-skulled .
And in a sudden wave---wave%1:11:02:: of painful clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: , Alexander---person%1:03:00:: recognized a kinship---kinship%1:24:00:: with Spencer---person%1:03:00:: .
Here was another human who understood the stupidity---stupidity%1:04:00:: of quarreling with the inevitable---inevitable%1:11:00:: .
There was good fortune---good_fortune%1:26:00:: and there was bad and Philip Spencer---person%1:03:00:: , in handcuffs and ankle---ankle%1:08:00:: irons---irons%1:06:00:: , knew it to be a truth---truth%1:09:00:: .
He expected nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: for himself but that which naturally follows those marked for misfortune---misfortune%1:26:00:: .
The red haired captain---captain%1:18:02:: , towering above the prisoner---prisoner%1:18:00:: as a symbol---symbol%1:10:00:: of decency---decency%1:07:01:: and authority---authority%1:07:00:: , was shocked to find himself looking with sympathy upon Philip Spencer---person%1:03:00:: .
This tragic lad---lad%1:18:01:: had forged his own shackles---shackle%1:06:00:: .
But he could not have done so , could not have found the way---way%1:07:01:: , had fortune---fortune%1:19:00:: favored him .
And because fortune---fortune%1:19:00:: had favored neither the prisoner---prisoner%1:18:00:: nor the red haired captain---captain%1:18:02:: , they would be each other 's undoing---undoing%1:04:00:: .
`` Spencer---person%1:03:00:: , if there is guilt---guilt%1:26:00:: , if you do not deny your own , how is it possible for Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: to be innocent ?
He was your constant companion---companion%1:18:00:: '' .
The hazel eyes---eye%1:08:00:: met Alexander---person%1:03:00:: 's .
`` And do you think there is a reason---reason%1:16:00:: why I should accept your word---word%1:10:03:: '' ?
I have nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to gain by defending Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to lose , either , Spencer---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` That 's true '' , Spencer---person%1:03:00:: agreed and withdrew himself from the conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: .
His eyes---eye%1:08:00:: went back to contemplation---contemplation%1:04:01:: of the sea---sea%1:17:00:: .
`` I am innocent , Captain---captain%1:18:02:: '' , Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: said again .
`` Before God , Captain---captain%1:18:02:: , I am innocent '' .
And though it was logical that a man---man%1:18:00:: who could plot mass murder---mass_murder%1:04:00:: would not hesitate to speak an untruth---untruth%1:10:00:: , still it was difficult to understand why Spencer---person%1:03:00:: spoke only for Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: .
The boatswain---boatswain%1:18:00:: was as guilty as any .
No action---action%1:04:02:: of his could be interpreted in his favor---favor%1:07:00:: and four midshipmen---midshipman%1:18:00:: , prior to their knowing the significance---significance%1:09:01:: of the Greek paper---paper%1:10:03:: , had seen it in Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: 's hands---hand%1:08:00:: while Spencer---person%1:03:00:: whispered explanations---explanation%1:10:00:: .
`` I thought '' , Midshipman Rogers---person%1:03:00:: had told Alexander---person%1:03:00:: , `` that Spencer---person%1:03:00:: was teaching him geometry---geometry%1:09:00:: '' .
It was fantastic to turn from the seven men in shackles---shackle%1:06:00:: to the wardroom---wardroom%1:06:00:: , where a class---class%1:14:03:: of apprentices---apprentice%1:18:00:: awaited him .
This was a training ship---training_ship%1:06:00:: and the training---training%1:04:00:: would continue , but there was an element---element%1:09:00:: of frightful absurdity---absurdity%1:07:01:: here which Alexander---person%1:03:00:: recognized .
Some of these apprentices---apprentice%1:18:00:: were , in physical strength---strength%1:07:00:: , already men---man%1:18:00:: and doubtless a percentage---percentage%1:21:00:: of them were Spencer---person%1:03:00:: 's followers---follower%1:18:00:: .
It is not easy for the therapist---therapist%1:18:00:: to discern when , in the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's communicating---communicating%1:10:00:: , an introject---introject%1:09:00:: has appeared and is holding sway .
One learns to become alert to changes---change%1:11:00:: in his vocal tone---tone%1:10:01:: - to his voice---voice%1:10:00:: 's suddenly shifting to a quality---quality%1:07:01:: not like his usual one , a quality---quality%1:07:01:: which sounds somehow artificial or , in some instances---instance%1:11:00:: , parrotlike .
The content---content%1:10:00:: of his words---words%1:10:03:: may lapse back into monotonous repetition---repetition%1:11:00:: , as if a phonograph needle---phonograph_needle%1:06:00:: were stuck in one groove---groove%1:25:00:: ; only seldom is it so simple as to be a matter---matter%1:09:01:: of his obviously parroting some timeworn axiom---axiom%1:10:00:: , common to our culture---culture%1:14:00:: , which he has evidently heard , over and over , from a parent---parent%1:18:00:: until he experiences it as part---part%1:24:00:: of him .
One hebephrenic woman---woman%1:18:00:: often became submerged in what felt to me like a somehow phony experience---experience%1:11:00:: of pseudo emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: , during which , despite her wracking sobs and streaming cheeks---cheek%1:08:00:: , I felt only a cold annoyance---annoyance%1:26:00:: with her .
Eventually such incidents---incident%1:11:00:: became more sporadic , and more sharply demarcated from her day-after-day behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: , and in one particular session---session%1:10:00:: , after several minutes---minute%1:28:00:: of such behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: - which , as usual , went on without any accompanying words---words%1:10:03:: from her - she asked , eagerly , `` Did you see Granny---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
At first I did not know what she meant ; I thought she must be seeing me as some one who had just come from seeing her grandmother---grandmother%1:18:00:: , in their distant home city---city%1:15:00:: .
Then I realized that she had been deliberately showing me , this time---time%1:11:00:: , what Granny---person%1:03:00:: was like ; and when I replied in this spirit---spirit%1:10:00:: , she corroborated my hunch---hunch%1:09:00:: .
At another phase---phase%1:28:00:: in the therapy---therapy%1:04:00:: , when a pathogenic mother---mother%1:18:00:: introject---introject%1:09:00:: began to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene---scene%1:26:00:: , she muttered in a low but intense voice---voice%1:07:00:: , to herself , `` I hate that woman---woman%1:18:00:: inside me '' !
I could evoke no further elaboration---elaboration%1:04:01:: from her about this ; but a few seconds---second%1:28:00:: later she was standing directly across the room---room%1:06:00:: from me , looking me in the eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and saying in a scathingly condemnatory tone---tone%1:10:01:: , `` Your father---father%1:18:00:: despises you '' !
Again , I at first misconstrued this disconcertingly intense communication---communication%1:10:01:: , and I quickly cast through my mind---mind%1:09:00:: to account for her being able to speak , with such utter conviction---conviction%1:09:00:: , of an opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: held by my father---father%1:18:00:: , now several years---year%1:28:01:: deceased .
She looked confused at this , and I felt sure it had been a wrong response---response%1:10:01:: for me to make .
It then occurred to me to ask , `` Is that what that woman---woman%1:18:00:: told you '' ?
She clearly agreed that this had been the case---case%1:09:00:: .
I realized , now , that she had been showing me , in what impressed me as being a very accurate way---way%1:07:01:: , something her mother---mother%1:18:00:: had once said to her ; it was as if she was showing me one of the reasons---reason%1:16:00:: why she hated that woman---woman%1:18:00:: inside her .
What had been an unmanageably powerful introject---introject%1:09:00:: was now , despite its continuing charge---charge%1:04:01:: of energy---energy%1:19:00:: disconcerting to me , sufficiently within control---control%1:07:00:: of her ego---ego%1:09:01:: that she could use it to show me what this introjected mother---mother%1:18:00:: was like .
Earlier , this woman---woman%1:18:00:: had been so filled with a chaotic variety---variety%1:14:01:: of introjects---introject%1:09:00:: that at times , when she was in her room---room%1:06:00:: alone , it would sound to a passerby---passerby%1:18:00:: as though there were several different persons---person%1:03:00:: in the room---room%1:06:00:: , as she would vocalize in various kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of voice---voice%1:07:00:: .
A somewhat less fragmented hebephrenic patient---patient%1:18:00:: of mine , who used to often seclude herself in her room---room%1:06:00:: , often sounded through the closed door---door%1:06:00:: - as I would find on passing by , between our sessions---session%1:10:00:: - for all the world like two persons---person%1:03:00:: , a scolding mother---mother%1:18:00:: and a defensive child---child%1:18:01:: .
Particularly hard for the therapist---therapist%1:18:00:: to grasp are those instances---instance%1:11:00:: in which the patient---patient%1:18:00:: is manifesting an introject---introject%1:09:00:: traceable to something in the therapist---therapist%1:18:00:: , some aspect---aspect%1:07:02:: of the therapist---therapist%1:18:00:: of which the latter is himself only poorly aware , and the recognition---recognition%1:26:00:: of which , as a part---part%1:24:00:: of himself , he finds distinctly unwelcome .
I have found , time and again , that some bit of particularly annoying and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rests , in the final analysis , on this basis ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: of my personality , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient 's behavior .
I have found , time and again , that some bit---bit%1:23:01:: of particularly annoying and intractable behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: on the part---part%1:09:02:: of a patient---patient%1:18:00:: rests , in the final analysis , on this basis---basis%1:09:00:: ; and only when I can acknowledge this , to myself , as being indeed an aspect---aspect%1:07:02:: of my personality---personality%1:07:00:: , does it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: of the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: .
For example , one hebephrenic man used to annoy me , month after month , by saying , whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment that I would be seeing him on the following day , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion - as though it were his due for me to thank him for the privilege of spending the hour with him , and he were thus pointing up my failure to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank you '' to him at the end---end%1:11:00:: of each session .
For example , one hebephrenic man---man%1:18:00:: used to annoy me , month---month%1:28:01:: after month---month%1:28:01:: , by saying , whenever I got up to leave and made my fairly steoreotyped comment---comment%1:10:00:: that I would be seeing him on the following day---day%1:28:00:: , or whenever , `` You 're welcome '' , in a notably condescending fashion---fashion%1:07:00:: - as though it were his due---due%1:07:00:: for me to thank him for the privilege---privilege%1:07:02:: of spending the hour---hour%1:28:00:: with him , and he were thus pointing up my failure---failure%1:04:00:: to utter a humbly grateful , `` thank you---thank_you%1:10:00:: '' to him at the end---end%1:09:00:: of each session---session%1:10:00:: .
Eventually it became clear to me , partly with the aid---aid%1:04:00:: of another schizophrenic patient---patient%1:18:00:: who could point out my condescension---condescension%1:07:00:: to me somewhat more directly , that this man---man%1:18:00:: , with his condescending , `` You 're welcome '' , was very accurately personifying an element---element%1:09:00:: of obnoxious condescension---condescension%1:07:00:: which had been present in my own demeanor---demeanor%1:07:00:: , over these months---month%1:28:01:: , on each of these occasions---occasion%1:11:00:: when I had bid him good-bye---good-bye%1:10:00:: with the consoling note---note%1:10:02:: , each time---time%1:11:00:: , that the healing Christ---christ%1:18:00:: would be stooping to dispense this succor---succor%1:04:00:: to the poor suffered again on the morrow---morrow%1:28:00:: .
Another patient---patient%1:18:00:: , a paranoid woman---woman%1:18:00:: , for many months---month%1:28:01:: infuriated not only me but the ward---ward%1:06:00:: personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: and her fellow patients---patient%1:18:00:: by arrogantly behaving as though she owned the whole building---building%1:06:00:: , as though she were the only person---person%1:03:00:: in it whose needs---need%1:26:00:: were to be met .
This behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: on her part---part%1:09:02:: subsided only after I had come to see the uncomfortably close similarity---similarity%1:07:00:: between , on the one hand , her arranging the ventilation---ventilation%1:06:00:: of the common living room---living_room%1:06:00:: to her own liking---liking%1:12:00:: , or turning the television---television%1:06:01:: off or on without regard to the wishes---wish%1:12:00:: of the others , and on the other hand , my own coming stolidly into her room---room%1:06:00:: despite her persistent and vociferous objections---objection%1:10:01:: , bringing my big easy chair---easy_chair%1:06:00:: with me , usually shutting the windows---window%1:06:00:: of her room---room%1:06:00:: which she preferred to keep in a very cold state---state%1:03:00:: , and plunking myself down in my chair---chair%1:06:00:: - in short , behaving as if I owned her room---room%1:06:00:: .
Here a variety---variety%1:14:01:: of meanings---meaning%1:10:00:: and emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression---expression%1:10:01:: , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement---statement%1:10:00:: .
Here a variety of meanings and emotions are concentrated , or reduced , in their communicative expression , to some comparatively simple seeming verbal or nonverbal statement---statement%1:10:05:: .
One finds , for example , that a terse and stereotyped verbal expression---expression%1:10:00:: , seeming at first to be a mere hollow convention---convention%1:09:00:: , reveals itself over the months---month%1:28:01:: of therapy---therapy%1:04:00:: as the vehicle---vehicle%1:10:00:: for expressing the most varied and intense feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: , and the most unconventional of meanings---meaning%1:10:00:: .
More than anything , it is the therapist---therapist%1:18:00:: 's intuitive sensing---sensing%1:09:00:: of these latent meanings---meaning%1:10:00:: in the stereotype---stereotype%1:09:00:: which helps these meanings---meaning%1:10:00:: to become revealed , something like a spread-out deck of cards---deck_of_cards%1:14:00:: , on sporadic occasions---occasion%1:11:00:: over the passage---passage%1:06:00:: of the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's and his months---month%1:28:01:: of work---work%1:04:00:: together .
one cannot assume , of course , that all these accumulated meanings---meaning%1:10:00:: were inherent in the stereotype---stereotype%1:09:00:: at the beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: of the therapy---therapy%1:04:00:: , or at any one time---time%1:11:00:: later on when the stereotype---stereotype%1:09:00:: was uttered ; probably it is correct to think of it as a matter---matter%1:09:01:: of a well grooved , stereotyped mode---mode%1:07:00:: of expression---expression%1:10:01:: - and no , or but a few , other communicational grooves---groove%1:04:00:: , as yet - being there , available for the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's use---use%1:04:00:: , as newly emerging emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: and ideas---idea%1:09:00:: well up in him over the course---course%1:14:00:: of months---month%1:28:01:: .
But it is true that the therapist---therapist%1:18:00:: can sense , when he hears this stereotype---stereotype%1:09:00:: , that there are at this moment---moment%1:28:00:: many emotional determinants---determinant%1:09:00:: at work in it , a blurred babel of indistinct voices---voice%1:07:00:: which have yet to become clearly delineated from one another .
Sometimes it is not a verbal stereotype---stereotype%1:09:00:: - a `` How are you now '' ? or an `` I want to go home '' , or whatever - but a nonverbal one which reveals itself , gradually , as the condensed expression---expression%1:10:02:: of more than one latent meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: .
A hebephrenic man---man%1:18:00:: used to give a repetitious wave---wave%1:10:01:: of his hand---hand%1:08:00:: a number---number%1:07:00:: of times---time%1:11:00:: during his largely silent hours---hour%1:28:00:: with his therapist---therapist%1:18:00:: .
When the therapist---therapist%1:18:00:: came to feel on sufficiently sure ground---ground%1:24:00:: with him to ask him , `` What is that , Bill---person%1:03:00:: - hello---hello%1:10:00:: or farewell---farewell%1:10:00:: '' ?
, the patient---patient%1:18:00:: replied , `` Both , Dearie---person%1:03:00:: - two in one '' .
Of all the possible forms---form%1:09:01:: of nonverbal expression---expression%1:10:02:: , that which seems best to give release---release%1:04:01:: , and communicational expression---expression%1:10:02:: , to complex and undifferentiated feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: is laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: .
It is no coincidence---coincidence%1:11:00:: that the hebephrenic patient---patient%1:18:00:: , the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patients---patient%1:18:00:: , shows , as one of his characteristic symptoms---symptom%1:10:00:: , laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: - laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: which now makes one feel scorned or hated , which now makes one feel like weeping , or which now gives one a glimpse---glimpse%1:04:00:: of the bleak and empty expanse---expanse%1:07:01:: of man---man%1:18:04:: 's despair---despair%1:12:00:: ; and which , more often than all these , conveys a welter---welter%1:26:00:: of feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: which could in no way be conveyed by any number---number%1:07:00:: of words---words%1:10:03:: , words---words%1:10:03:: which are so unlike this welter---welter%1:26:00:: in being formed and discrete from one another .
To a much less full extent---extent%1:07:00:: , the hebephrenic person---person%1:03:00:: 's belching---belching%1:04:00:: or flatus---flatus%1:04:00:: has a comparable communicative function---function%1:07:00:: ; in working with these patients---patient%1:18:00:: the therapist---therapist%1:18:00:: eventually gets to do some at least private mulling over of the possible meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: of a belch---belch%1:04:00:: , or the passage---passage%1:04:05:: of flatus---flatus%1:04:00:: , not only because he is reduced to this for lack---lack%1:26:00:: of anything else to analyze , but also because he learns that even these animal---animal%1:03:00:: like sounds---sound%1:07:00:: constitute forms---form%1:09:01:: of communication---communication%1:10:01:: in which , from time to time , quite different things---thing%1:10:00:: are being said , long before the patient---patient%1:18:00:: can become sufficiently aware of these , as distinct feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: and concepts---concept%1:09:00:: , to say them in words---words%1:10:03:: .
As I have been intimating , in the schizophrenic---schizophrenic%1:18:00:: - and perhaps also in the dreams---dream%1:09:01:: of the neurotic---neurotic%1:18:00:: ; this is a question---question%1:10:01:: which I have no wish---wish%1:12:00:: to take up - condensation---condensation%1:09:00:: is a phenomenon---phenomenon%1:11:00:: in which one finds not a condensed expression---expression%1:10:02:: of various feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: and ideas---idea%1:09:00:: which are , at an unconscious level---level%1:26:00:: , well sorted out , but rather a condensed expression---expression%1:10:02:: of feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: and ideas---idea%1:09:00:: which , even in the unconscious---unconscious%1:09:00:: , have yet to become well differentiated from one another .
Freeman---person%1:03:00:: , Cameron---person%1:03:00:: and McGhie---person%1:03:00:: , in their description---description%1:10:01:: of the disturbances---disturbance%1:26:02:: of thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: found in chronic schizophrenic patients---patient%1:18:00:: , say , in regard to condensation---condensation%1:09:00:: , that `` the lack---lack%1:26:00:: of adequate discrimination---discrimination%1:09:00:: between the self---self%1:09:00:: and the environment---environment%1:26:00:: , and the objects---object%1:03:00:: contained therein in itself is the prototypical condensation---condensation%1:09:00:: '' .
In my experience---experience%1:09:01:: , a great many of the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's more puzzling verbal communications---communication%1:03:00:: are so for the reason---reason%1:10:01:: that concrete meanings---meaning%1:10:00:: have not become differentiated from figurative meanings---meaning%1:10:00:: in his subjective experience---experience%1:09:01:: .
Thus he may be referring to some concrete thing---thing%1:06:01:: , or incident---incident%1:11:00:: , in his immediate environment---environment%1:26:00:: by some symbolic sounding , hyperbolic reference---reference%1:10:02:: to transcendental events---event%1:03:00:: on the global scene---scene%1:26:00:: .
Recently , for example , a paranoid woman 's large-scale philosophizing , in the session , about the intrusive curiosity which has become , in her opinion , a deplorable characteristic of mid twentieth century human culture , developed itself , before the end---end%1:11:00:: of the session , into a suspicion that I was surreptitiously peeking at her partially exposed breast , as indeed I was .

Or , equally often , a concretistic seeming , particularistic seeming statement---statement%1:10:00:: may consist , with its mundane exterior---exterior%1:15:01:: , in a form---form%1:09:01:: of poetry---poetry%1:10:03:: - may be full of meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: and emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: when interpreted as a figurative expression---expression%1:10:02:: : a metaphor---metaphor%1:10:00:: , a simile---simile%1:10:00:: , an allegory---allegory%1:10:00:: , or some other symbolic mode---mode%1:07:00:: of speaking---speaking%1:10:01:: .
Of such hidden meanings---meaning%1:10:00:: the patient---patient%1:18:00:: himself is , more often than not , entirely unaware .
His subjective experience---experience%1:09:01:: may be a remarkably concretistic one .
One hebephrenic women confided to me , `` I live in a world of words '' , as if , to her , words were fully concrete objects ; Burnham , in his excellent article ( 1955 ) concerning schizophrenic communication---communication%1:10:01:: , includes mention of similar clinical material .

A borderline schizophrenic young man---man%1:18:00:: told me that to him the various theoretical concepts---concept%1:09:00:: about which he had been expounding , in a most articulate fashion---fashion%1:07:00:: , during session---session%1:10:00:: after session---session%1:10:00:: with me , were like great cubes---cube%1:25:01:: of almost tangibly solid matter---matter%1:03:00:: up in the air---air%1:15:00:: above him ; as he spoke I was reminded of the great bales---bale%1:06:00:: of cargo---cargo%1:06:00:: which are swung , high in the air---air%1:15:00:: , from a docked steamship---steamship%1:06:00:: .

His rage---rage%1:12:00:: had built up as he made his way here from the second floor---floor%1:06:01:: , helped by the quantity---quantity%1:07:00:: of champagne---champagne%1:13:00:: he had consumed .
Hoag---person%1:03:00:: said , `` I did n't send for you , Leigh---person%1:03:00:: .

Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: and the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: are alone right now '' .
Mahzeer and the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: are alone right now '' .
Hoag---person%1:03:00:: looked terrified .
`` Where 'd you expect , the john---john%1:06:00:: ?
Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Facing us , two flights---flight%1:06:00:: up .
Look , old man---old_man%1:18:03:: , you can n't go up .
They won n't even let you in the front door---front_door%1:06:00:: .
So why do n't you be a good boy---boy%1:18:02:: and '' -
Hoag---person%1:03:00:: grabbed him by the shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
`` Listen to me , Leigh---person%1:03:00:: .
If you want to spend another day---day%1:28:00:: in the State Department---state_department%1:14:00:: - another day---day%1:28:00:: - you get in there and tell that captain---captain%1:18:05:: what I told you '' .
He bit out the words---words%1:10:03:: .
Griffith---person%1:03:00:: raised placating hands---hand%1:08:00:: .
`` Easy does it , Phil---person%1:03:00:: .
I 'm on my way---way%1:04:02:: '' .
He turned and fled into the house---house%1:06:00:: and made his way up the marble---marble%1:27:00:: stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: without once looking back .
On the second landing---landing%1:06:01:: he paused to look for Docherty---person%1:03:00:: , did n't see him , and accepted a glass---glass%1:23:00:: of champagne---champagne%1:13:00:: .
He took several large swallows---swallow%1:13:00:: , recollected that Docherty---person%1:03:00:: had gone up another flight---flight%1:06:00:: , and decided he would be wise to cover himself by finding him .
The way---way%1:26:00:: Hoag---person%1:03:00:: was , no telling what he might say or do .
He finished his champagne---champagne%1:13:00:: and climbed uncertainly to the next landing---landing%1:06:01:: .
At the top---top%1:15:01:: a uniformed officer---officer%1:18:01:: blocked further progress---progress%1:04:00:: .
`` I want Captain Docherty---person%1:03:00:: '' .
He spotted Docherty---person%1:03:00:: coming out of a room---room%1:06:00:: at the far end---end%1:15:00:: of the corridor---corridor%1:06:00:: and called to him .
Docherty---person%1:03:00:: said , `` It 's okay , Bonfiglio---person%1:03:00:: , let him by '' .
Griffith---person%1:03:00:: said , `` Hoag---person%1:03:00:: told me to tell you '' - he waited until they were close ; it was hideously embarrassing - `` not to let the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: be alone with Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Griffith said , `` Hoag told me to tell you '' - he waited until they were close ; it was hideously embarrassing - `` not to let the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: be alone with Mahzeer '' .
Griffith---person%1:03:00:: looked half crocked to the captain---captain%1:18:05:: ; it would be just like him .
`` He claims Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: 's in a plot---plot%1:09:00:: to kill the P.M . '' .
Docherty---person%1:03:00:: went taut : was it possible ?
Could the ambassador---ambassador%1:18:00:: himself be the man---man%1:18:04:: on this side---side%1:14:00:: the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: feared ?
Could the ambassador himself be the man on this side the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: feared ?
Not possible , he thought ; the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: knew who his enemy was here ; he was n't going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter .
Not possible , he thought ; the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: knew who his enemy---enemy%1:18:00:: was here ; he was n't going to allow himself to be led meekly to the slaughter---slaughter%1:04:00:: .
And if by some wild chance---chance%1:19:00:: Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: was the man---man%1:18:04:: , he would n't dare try anything now - not after Docherty---person%1:03:00:: had looked in on the two of them to see that all was well .
Docherty---person%1:03:00:: was damned if he would make a fool---fool%1:18:00:: of himself again the way---way%1:07:01:: he had earlier over the laundry truck---laundry_truck%1:06:00:: .
One more muddleheaded play---play%1:26:00:: like that one and they 'd be leading him away .
`` Where 'd your friend---friend%1:18:00:: Hoag---person%1:03:00:: get his information---information%1:09:00:: '' ?
`` Have n't the faintest , Captain---captain%1:18:05:: '' .
Troubled , he continued along the corridor---corridor%1:06:00:: , poking his head---head%1:08:00:: into the next office---office%1:06:00:: for a careful look---look%1:04:00:: around .
But Hoag---person%1:03:00:: had not stayed on the front steps---steps%1:06:00:: when Griffith---person%1:03:00:: disappeared into the building---building%1:06:00:: .
He was unwilling to rely on Griffith---person%1:03:00:: 's carrying his message---message%1:10:01:: , and he had no confidence---confidence%1:12:00:: the police---police%1:14:00:: would act on it .
If Mahzeer was alone with the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: he could be arranging his execution while Hoag stood out here shivering in the darkening street .
If Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: was alone with the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: he could be arranging his execution---execution%1:04:00:: while Hoag---person%1:03:00:: stood out here shivering in the darkening street---street%1:06:00:: .
The door---door%1:06:00:: opened and three men---man%1:18:00:: and a woman---woman%1:18:00:: in a sari---sari%1:06:00:: swept past him and down the stairs .
In the lighted interior---interior%1:15:01:: he saw other men---man%1:18:00:: and women---woman%1:18:00:: struggling into their wraps---wrap%1:06:00:: .
These were the early departures---departure%1:04:00:: ; in half---half%1:23:00:: an hour---hour%1:28:00:: the reception---reception%1:14:00:: would be over .
If Mahzeer was planning to set up the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: for Muller he would have to do it in the next few minutes .
If Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: was planning to set up the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: for Muller---person%1:03:00:: he would have to do it in the next few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
Hoag---person%1:03:00:: descended the stone---stone%1:27:00:: steps---steps%1:06:00:: to the street---street%1:06:00:: and looked up at the building---building%1:06:00:: .
Wide windows---window%1:06:00:: with many small leaded panes---pane%1:06:00:: swept across the upper stories---story%1:06:00:: .
On the second floor---floor%1:06:01:: he saw the animated faces---face%1:08:00:: of the party---party%1:14:00:: guests---guest%1:18:00:: ; the scene---scene%1:15:00:: looked like a Christmas card---christmas_card%1:10:00:: .
On the third floor---floor%1:06:01:: one of the two windows---window%1:06:00:: was lighted ; it was framed in maroon drapes---drape%1:06:00:: , and no faces---face%1:08:00:: were visible .
This would be Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: .
He and the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: would be back from the window---window%1:06:00:: , seated at Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: 's desk---desk%1:06:00:: ; they would be going over papers---papers%1:10:00:: Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: had saved as excuse---excuse%1:10:00:: for just such a meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: .
He and the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: would be back from the window , seated at Mahzeer 's desk ; they would be going over papers Mahzeer had saved as excuse for just such a meeting .
In a minute---minute%1:28:00:: , or five minutes---minute%1:28:00:: , the business---business%1:09:00:: would be done ; Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: would stand up , the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: would follow .
In a minute , or five minutes , the business would be done ; Mahzeer would stand up , the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: would follow .
Mahzeer would direct the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: 's attention to something out the window and would guide him forward and then step to one side .
Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: would direct the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: 's attention---attention%1:09:00:: to something out the window---window%1:06:00:: and would guide him forward and then step to one side---side%1:15:02:: .
The single shot---shot%1:06:00:: would come ; Hoag---person%1:03:00:: would carry its sound---sound%1:07:00:: to his grave---grave%1:28:00:: .
Mahzeer---person%1:03:00:: , of course , would be desolate .
How was he to suspect that an assassin---assassin%1:18:00:: had been lurking somewhere across the street---street%1:06:00:: waiting for just such a chance---chance%1:26:00:: ?
Hoag---person%1:03:00:: turned .
Where across the street---street%1:06:00:: ?
Where was Muller---person%1:03:00:: waiting with the rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: ?
Narrow four story---story%1:06:00:: buildings---building%1:06:00:: ran the length---length%1:07:00:: of the block---block%1:15:00:: like books---book%1:06:00:: tightly packed on a shelf---shelf%1:06:00:: .
Most of them could be eliminated ; Muller---person%1:03:00:: 's would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite .
The legation---legation%1:04:00:: was generously set back from the building---building%1:06:00:: line---line%1:14:03:: ; if the angle---angle%1:25:00:: of fire---fire%1:04:00:: were too great the jutting buildings---building%1:06:00:: on either side---side%1:15:02:: would interfere .
Would the shot---shot%1:06:00:: come from a roof---roof%1:06:00:: ?
Would the shot---shot%1:04:00:: come from a roof ?
He ran his eye---eye%1:08:00:: along the roof---roof%1:06:00:: copings---coping%1:06:00:: ; almost at once a figure---figure%1:08:00:: bulked up .
But dully glinting on the dark form---form%1:08:00:: were the buttons and badge of a policeman .
But dully glinting on the dark form---form%1:07:01:: were the buttons---button%1:06:00:: and badge---badge%1:10:00:: of a policeman---policeman%1:18:00:: .
With a cop---cop%1:18:00:: patrolling the road---road%1:06:00:: Muller---person%1:03:00:: would have to be inside a building---building%1:06:00:: - if he was here at all , and not waiting for the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:01:: somewhere between this street---street%1:06:00:: and the terminal---terminal%1:06:00:: building---building%1:06:00:: at La Guardia Airport---location%1:03:00:: .
With a cop patrolling the road Muller would have to be inside a building - if he was here at all , and not waiting for the prime minister---prime_minister%1:18:00:: somewhere between this street and the terminal building at La Guardia Airport .
Hoag---person%1:03:00:: crossed the narrow street---street%1:06:00:: , squeezing between parked cars---car%1:06:00:: to reach the sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: .
From this side---side%1:15:02:: he could see farther into the legation---legation%1:04:00:: 's third story---story%1:06:00:: window---window%1:06:00:: , but he saw no faces---face%1:18:00:: ; the room---room%1:06:00:: 's occupants---occupant%1:18:00:: were still seated or they had been called into the hallway---hallway%1:06:00:: by an alarmed police captain---police_captain%1:18:00:: .
From this side he could see farther into the legation 's third story window , but he saw no faces---face%1:08:00:: ; the room 's occupants were still seated or they had been called into the hallway by an alarmed police captain .
He walked rapidly along the buildings---building%1:06:00:: scanning their facades---facade%1:06:00:: : one was a club---club%1:06:02:: - that was out ; two others he ruled out because all their windows---window%1:06:00:: were lighted .
He climbed the steps---steps%1:06:00:: of the first and opened the door---door%1:06:00:: to the vestibule---vestibule%1:06:00:: .
He had assumed that all these buildings---building%1:06:00:: had been divided into apartments---apartment%1:06:00:: , but this one , from a glance---glance%1:04:00:: at the hall---hall%1:06:05:: furnishings , was obviously still a functioning town house---town_house%1:06:01:: , and its owners---owner%1:18:02:: were in residence---residence%1:04:00:: ; that made it doubtful as the hiding place---hiding_place%1:15:00:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: whose plans---plan%1:09:00:: had to be made in advance .
He went on to the next building---building%1:06:00:: and found what he expected - the mingled cooking---cooking%1:04:00:: aromas---aroma%1:07:00:: of a public vestibule---vestibule%1:06:00:: .
On one wall---wall%1:06:00:: was the brass---brass%1:27:00:: front---front%1:06:00:: of a row---row%1:14:00:: of mailboxes---mailbox%1:06:00:: ; there were six apartments---apartment%1:06:00:: .
The names---name%1:10:00:: on the mailboxes---mailbox%1:06:00:: meant nothing to him .
This was senseless - he had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: what to look for .
He peered in the boxes---mailbox%1:06:00:: themselves ; all were empty except one , and that one was jammed with letters---letter%1:10:00:: and magazines---magazine%1:06:02:: .
The occupants---occupant%1:18:00:: of Apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: Number---number%1:10:02:: 3 were probably away for a few days---day%1:28:00:: , and not likely to return on a Friday---friday%1:28:00:: .
Had Muller made the same deduction---deduction%1:09:01:: ?
Had Muller---person%1:03:00:: made the same deduction---deduction%1:09:00:: ?
Muller---person%1:03:00:: was attracted to the lore---lore%1:09:00:: of mailboxes---mailbox%1:06:00:: .
He opened the inner door---door%1:06:00:: ; the cooking---cooking%1:04:00:: odors---odor%1:07:00:: were stronger - all over the city---city%1:15:00:: , at this hour---hour%1:28:01:: , housewives---housewife%1:18:00:: would be fussing over stoves---stove%1:06:01:: .
He climbed , as quickly as he could urge his body---body%1:08:00:: , up the two unbroken flights---flight%1:06:00:: to the third floor---floor%1:06:01:: , pulling himself along on a delicate balustrade---balustrade%1:06:00:: , all that remained of the building---building%1:06:00:: 's beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: .
He paused on the landing---landing%1:06:01:: to steady his breathing---breathing%1:04:00:: and then bent to examine the single door---door%1:06:00:: by the light---light%1:06:00:: of the weak bulb---bulb%1:06:00:: overhead .
Now---now%1:28:00:: he was certain : the lock---lock%1:06:00:: had not yielded to Muller---person%1:03:00:: 's collection---collection%1:14:00:: of keys---key%1:06:00:: ; fresh scars---scar%1:07:00:: showed that the door---door%1:06:00:: had been prized open .
It had been shut again , but the lock---lock%1:06:00:: was broken ; he noted with a thrill---thrill%1:12:02:: of fear---fear%1:12:00:: that the door---door%1:06:00:: moved under his touch---touch%1:11:00:: .
He had thought no further than finding Muller---person%1:03:00:: .
He realized now he had more than half hoped he would n't find him - that Muller---person%1:03:00:: would not be here , that the attempt---attempt%1:04:02:: would be scheduled for somewhere beyond Hoag---person%1:03:00:: 's control---control%1:07:00:: .
He realized now he had more than half hoped he would n't find him - that Muller would not be here , that the attempt would be scheduled for somewhere beyond Hoag 's control---control%1:04:00:: .
He could not break in on an armed man---man%1:18:00:: .
He would have to climb back down to the street---street%1:06:00:: and signal a cop---cop%1:18:00:: .
Was there time---time%1:28:05:: ?
His thoughts were scattered by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door---door%1:06:01:: .
His thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: were scattered by the sharp report---report%1:11:00:: of a rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: from the other side---side%1:15:02:: of the door---door%1:06:00:: .
Hoag---person%1:03:00:: pushed open the door---door%1:06:00:: : at the far end---end%1:15:00:: of the long dark room---room%1:06:00:: Muller---person%1:03:00:: was faintly silhouetted against the window---window%1:06:00:: , the rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: still raised ; he stood with his feet---foot%1:08:01:: apart on a kitchen table---kitchen_table%1:06:00:: he had dragged to the sill---sill%1:06:00:: .
He turned his head---head%1:08:00:: to the source---source%1:15:00:: of the disturbance---disturbance%1:11:00:: and instantly back to the window---window%1:06:00:: and his rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: sight , dismissing Hoag---person%1:03:00:: for the moment with the same contempt---contempt%1:12:00:: he had shown in their encounter---encounter%1:11:00:: at Hoag---person%1:03:00:: 's apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: .
Hoag---person%1:03:00:: stretched his left hand---left_hand%1:08:00:: to the wall---wall%1:06:00:: and fumbled for the switch---switch%1:06:01:: : evil---evil%1:07:02:: flourishes in the dark---dark%1:26:00:: .
The room---room%1:06:00:: was bathed in light---light%1:06:00:: at the instant---instant%1:28:00:: Muller---person%1:03:00:: 's second shot---shot%1:06:00:: came .
The room was bathed in light at the instant Muller 's second shot---shot%1:04:00:: came .
Muller---person%1:03:00:: , nakedly exposed at the bright window---window%1:06:00:: like a deer---deer%1:05:00:: pinned in a car---car%1:06:00:: 's headlights---headlight%1:06:00:: , threw down the rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: and turned to jump from the table---table%1:06:01:: ; his face---face%1:08:00:: wore a look---look%1:07:01:: of outrage---outrage%1:12:00:: .
A shot---shot%1:06:00:: caught him and straightened him up in screaming pain---pain%1:26:00:: ; a following volley---volley%1:04:00:: of shots---shot%1:06:00:: shattered glass---glass%1:27:00:: , ripped the ceiling---ceiling%1:06:00:: , and sent him lurching heavily from the table---table%1:06:01:: .
He was dead before his body---body%1:08:00:: made contact---contact%1:11:00:: with the floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
Hoag---person%1:03:00:: stumbled back into the hall---hall%1:06:03:: , leaned against the wall---wall%1:06:00:: , and started to retch .
After Captain Docherty---person%1:03:00:: sent Arleigh Griffith---person%1:03:00:: for Hoag---person%1:03:00:: he was able to complete his detailed inspection of the third floor---floor%1:06:01:: and to receive a report---report%1:10:01:: from his man---man%1:18:08:: covering the floors---floor%1:06:01:: above before Griffith---person%1:03:00:: returned , buoyed up by a brief stop---stop%1:04:02:: for another glass---glass%1:23:00:: of champagne---champagne%1:13:00:: .
The author---author%1:18:01:: of the anonymous notes---note%1:10:03:: seemed to be all-knowing .
For men---man%1:18:00:: who had left cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: alone after getting their first notices---notice%1:10:01:: had received no second .
But the day---day%1:28:01:: of the deadline---deadline%1:28:00:: came and passed , and the men---man%1:18:00:: who had scoffed at the warnings---warning%1:10:00:: laughed with satisfaction---satisfaction%1:12:00:: .
For , with a single exception---exception%1:09:01:: , nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: had happened to them .
The exception---exception%1:09:01:: was an Iron Mountain---location%1:03:00:: settler---settler%1:18:00:: named William Lewis---person%1:03:00:: .
After walking out to his corral---corral%1:06:00:: that morning---morning%1:28:00:: , he 'd been amazed to see the dust---dust%1:27:00:: puff up in front of his feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
A split second---split_second%1:28:00:: later , the distant crack---crack%1:11:00:: of a rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: had sounded .
He 'd mounted up immediately and raced with a revolver---revolver%1:06:00:: ready toward the spot---spot%1:15:01:: from which he 'd estimated the shot---shot%1:04:00:: had come .
But he had found all of the thickets---thicket%1:14:00:: and points---point%1:15:00:: of cover---cover%1:06:02:: deserted .
There had been no sign---sign%1:10:05:: of a rifleman---rifleman%1:18:01:: and no track---track%1:17:00:: or trace---trace%1:10:00:: to show that anyone had been near .
Lewis---person%1:03:00:: was a man---man%1:18:00:: who had made a full-time job---job%1:04:00:: of cow---cow%1:05:01:: stealing---stealing%1:04:00:: .
He had n't even pretended to be farming his spread---spread%1:06:01:: .
His land---land%1:17:01:: had never been plowed .
He had done his rustling---rustling%1:04:00:: openly and boasted about it .
He had received both first and second anonymous notices---notice%1:10:01:: , and each time---time%1:11:00:: he had accused his neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: of writing them .
He was a man---man%1:18:00:: , those neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: testified later , who did n't have a friend---friend%1:18:00:: in the world .
William Lewis---person%1:03:00:: made the rounds---round%1:15:00:: of all who lived near him again , that August---august%1:28:00:: morning---morning%1:28:00:: after a bullet---bullet%1:06:00:: landed at his feet---foot%1:08:01:: , and once more he accused and threatened everyone .
`` I 'll be ready next time---time%1:11:00:: '' ! he raged .
He had his chance---chance%1:26:00:: the very next morning---morning%1:28:00:: , for exactly the same thing---thing%1:26:00:: happened again .
This time---time%1:11:00:: Lewis---person%1:03:00:: had his own rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: in his hands---hand%1:08:00:: , and he threw some answering fire---fire%1:04:00:: back at the mysterious far-off shot---shot%1:04:00:: , then spent most of the day---day%1:28:02:: searching out the area---area%1:15:01:: .
He found nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: , but he still refused to give up and move out .
`` Just let me meet up with that damned bushwhackin ' coward---coward%1:18:00:: face-to-face '' ! he exploded .
He never got that chance---chance%1:26:00:: .
For the unseen , ghostlike rifleman---rifleman%1:18:01:: aimed a little higher the third time---time%1:11:00:: .
A .30-30 bullet---bullet%1:06:00:: smashed directly into the center---center%1:15:01:: of William Lewis---person%1:03:00:: ' chest---chest%1:08:00:: .
He slumped against a log---log%1:27:01:: fence rail---fence_rail%1:06:00:: , then tried to lift himself .
Two more shots---shot%1:04:00:: followed in quick succession---succession%1:07:00:: , dropping him limp and huddled on the ground---ground%1:17:00:: .
An inquest---inquest%1:04:00:: was held , and after a good deal---good_deal%1:23:00:: of testimony---testimony%1:10:00:: about the anonymous notes---note%1:10:03:: , the county---county%1:15:00:: coroner---coroner%1:18:00:: estimated that the shooting---shooting%1:04:01:: had been done from a distance---distance%1:07:01:: of 300 yards---yard%1:23:00:: .
Rumors---rumor%1:10:00:: of the offer---offer%1:10:00:: Tom Horn---person%1:03:00:: had made at the Stockgrowers' Association---group%1:03:00:: meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: had leaked out by then---then%1:28:00:: , and as a grand jury---grand_jury%1:14:00:: investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: of the murder---murder%1:04:00:: got underway , the prosecuting attorney---prosecuting_attorney%1:18:00:: , a Colonel Baird---person%1:03:00:: , ordered that the tall stock---stock%1:14:00:: detective---detective%1:18:00:: be summoned for questioning---questioning%1:10:00:: .
It took some time---time%1:28:05:: to locate Horn---person%1:03:00:: .
He was finally found in the Bates Hole---location%1:03:00:: region---region%1:15:01:: of Natrona County---location%1:03:00:: , two counties---county%1:15:00:: away .
Prosecutor Baird---person%1:03:00:: immediately assumed he was hiding out there after the shooting---shooting%1:04:01:: and began preparing an indictment---indictment%1:10:00:: .
But that indictment---indictment%1:10:00:: was never made .
For Tom Horn---person%1:03:00:: , it turned out , had a number---number%1:07:00:: of rancher---rancher%1:18:00:: and cowboy---cowboy%1:18:00:: witnesses---witness%1:18:00:: ready and willing to swear with straight faces---straight_face%1:10:00:: that he had been in Bates Hole---location%1:03:00:: the day---day%1:28:01:: of the killing---killing%1:11:00:: .
The former scout---scout%1:18:01:: 's alibi---alibi%1:10:00:: could n't be shaken .
The authorities---authorities%1:14:00:: had to release him .
He immediately rode on to Cheyenne---cheyenne%1:15:00:: , threw a ten day---day%1:28:00:: drinking---drinking%1:04:01:: spree---spree%1:04:00:: and dropped some very strong hints---hint%1:10:00:: among friends---friend%1:18:00:: .
`` Dead center---center%1:15:01:: at three hundred yards---yard%1:23:00:: , that coroner---coroner%1:18:00:: said '' ! he 'd grin .
`` Three shots---shot%1:06:00:: in that fella---fella%1:18:00:: ' fore he hit the ground---ground%1:17:00:: !
You reckon there 's two men---man%1:18:00:: in this state---state%1:15:01:: can shoot like that '' ?
Privately , he created and magnified an image---image%1:07:00:: of himself as a hired assassin---assassin%1:18:00:: .
For a blood---blood%1:08:00:: chilling ring---ring%1:07:00:: of terror---terror%1:12:00:: to the very sound---sound%1:07:00:: of his name---name%1:10:00:: was the tool---tool%1:04:00:: he needed for the job---job%1:04:01:: he 'd promised to do .
Tom Horn---person%1:03:00:: was soon back at work , giving his secret employers---employer%1:18:00:: their money---money%1:21:00:: 's worth---worth%1:23:00:: .
A good many beef---beef%1:05:00:: hungry settlers---settler%1:18:00:: were accepting the death---death%1:11:00:: of William Lewis---person%1:03:00:: as proof---proof%1:09:00:: that the warning---warning%1:10:00:: notes---note%1:10:03:: were not idle threats---threat%1:10:00:: .
The company---company%1:14:01:: herds---herd%1:14:00:: were being raided less often , and cabins---cabin%1:06:02:: and soddies---soddy%1:06:00:: all over the range---range%1:15:02:: were standing deserted .
But there were other homesteaders---homesteader%1:18:00:: who passed the Lewis---person%1:03:00:: murder---murder%1:04:00:: off as a personal grudge---grudge%1:12:00:: killing---killing%1:04:00:: , the work---work%1:06:00:: of one of his neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: .
The rustling---rustling%1:04:00:: problem---problem%1:26:00:: was by no means solved .
Even in the very area---area%1:15:01:: where the shooting---shooting%1:04:01:: had been done , cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: were still disappearing .
For less than a dozen miles---mile%1:23:01:: from the unplowed land---land%1:17:01:: of the dead man---man%1:18:00:: lived another settler---settler%1:18:00:: who had ignored the warnings---warning%1:10:00:: that his existence---existence%1:26:00:: might be foreclosed on - a blatant and defiant rustler---rustler%1:18:00:: named Fred Powell---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Fred---person%1:03:00:: was mighty crude about the way---way%1:07:01:: he took in cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: '' his own hired man---hired_man%1:18:00:: , Andy Ross---person%1:03:00:: , mentioned later .
`` Everyone knew it , but he sort of acted like he did n't care who knew it - even after them notes---note%1:10:03:: came , even after he 'd heard about Lewis---person%1:03:00:: , even after he 'd been shot at a couple---couple%1:23:01:: o ' times---time%1:11:00:: hisself '' !
On the morning---morning%1:28:00:: of September---september%1:28:00:: 10 , 1895 , Powell---person%1:03:00:: and Ross---person%1:03:00:: rose at dawn---dawn%1:28:00:: and began their day---day%1:28:02:: 's work---work%1:04:00:: .
Haying time---haying_time%1:04:00:: was close at hand , and they needed some strong branches---branch%1:20:00:: to repair a hay---hay%1:13:00:: rack---rack%1:06:01:: .
Harnessing a team---team%1:14:01:: to a buckboard---buckboard%1:06:00:: , they drove out to a willow---willow%1:20:00:: lined creek---creek%1:17:00:: about a half-mile---half_mile%1:23:00:: off , then climbed down and began chopping .
Andy Ross---person%1:03:00:: had just started swinging an ax---ax%1:06:00:: at his second willow---willow%1:20:00:: when the distant blast---blast%1:11:01:: of a rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: sounded .
He looked around in surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: , then noticed that Fred Powell---person%1:03:00:: was clutching his chest---chest%1:08:00:: .
The hired man---hired_man%1:18:00:: ran over to help his boss---boss%1:18:00:: .
Powell---person%1:03:00:: gasped .
Ross---person%1:03:00:: had no intention---intention%1:09:00:: of searching for the assassin---assassin%1:18:00:: .
He heaved the dead man---man%1:18:00:: onto the buckboard---buckboard%1:06:00:: , yelled and lashed at the team---team%1:14:01:: and got out of there fast .
But he brought back the sheriff---sheriff%1:18:00:: and several deputies---deputy%1:18:01:: , and to the lawmen---lawman%1:18:00:: the entire affair---affair%1:09:00:: seemed a repetition---repetition%1:11:00:: of the Lewis---person%1:03:00:: killing---killing%1:11:00:: .
A detailed scouring---scouring%1:04:01:: of the entire area---area%1:15:01:: revealed nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: beyond a ledge---ledge%1:17:00:: of rocks---rock%1:17:01:: that might have been the rifleman---rifleman%1:18:01:: 's hiding place---hiding_place%1:15:00:: .
There were no tracks---track%1:17:00:: of either hoofs---hoof%1:05:00:: or boots---boot%1:06:00:: .
Not even an empty cartridge---cartridge%1:06:00:: case---case%1:06:00:: could be found .
Once again , Tom Horn---person%1:03:00:: was the first and most likely suspect---suspect%1:18:00:: , and he was brought in for questioning---questioning%1:10:00:: immediately .
Once again , he shook his head---head%1:08:00:: , kept his face---face%1:07:00:: expressionless and his voice---voice%1:07:00:: very calm , and had a strongly supported alibi---alibi%1:10:00:: ready .
Later , riding in for some lusty enjoyment---enjoyment%1:04:00:: of the liquor---liquor%1:13:00:: and professional ladies---lady%1:18:02:: of Cheyenne---cheyenne%1:15:00:: , he laid claim to the killing---killing%1:11:00:: with the vague insinuations---insinuation%1:10:00:: he made .
`` Exterminatin ' cow---cow%1:05:01:: thieves---thief%1:18:00:: is just a business---business%1:04:00:: proposition---proposition%1:10:01:: with me '' , he 'd blandly announce .
`` And I sort o ' got a corner---corner%1:26:00:: on the market---market%1:14:00:: '' .
`` Tom---person%1:03:00:: '' , a friend---friend%1:18:00:: asked him once , `` how come you bushwhacked them rustlers---rustler%1:18:00:: ?
They would n't o ' stood no chance---chance%1:26:00:: with you in a plain , straight-out shoot-down---shoot-down%1:04:00:: '' .
He had lots---lots%1:23:00:: of friends---friend%1:18:00:: , then as always .
Even as he became widely known as a professional killer---killer%1:18:00:: , nearly every cowboy---cowboy%1:18:00:: and rancher---rancher%1:18:00:: in Wyoming---wyoming%1:15:00:: seemed proud to call him a friend---friend%1:18:00:: .
No man---man%1:18:00:: 's name---name%1:10:00:: brought more cheers---cheer%1:10:00:: when it was announced in a rodeo---rodeo%1:04:00:: .
`` Well '' , he explained , `` s'posin you was a nester swingin ' the long rope---rope%1:06:00:: ?
Which would you be most scairt of - a dry-gulchin ' or a shoot-down---shoot-down%1:04:00:: '' ?
`` Yeah , I can see that '' , the friend---friend%1:18:00:: was forced to agree .
The tall sunburnt rustler---rustler%1:18:00:: hunter---hunter%1:18:00:: stared in amazement---amazement%1:12:00:: .
`` Sportin '' ' ! he echoed again in soft wonder---wonder%1:12:00:: .
`` I seen a lot---lot%1:23:00:: o ' things---thing%1:11:00:: in my time---time%1:28:00:: .
I found a trooper---trooper%1:18:01:: once the Apache---apache%1:18:00:: had spread-eagled on an ant hill---anthill%1:17:00:: , and another time---time%1:11:00:: we ran across some teamsters---teamster%1:18:02:: they 'd caught , tied upside down on their own wagon wheels---wagon_wheel%1:06:00:: over little fires---fire%1:11:00:: until their brains---brain%1:08:00:: was exploded right out o ' their skulls---skull%1:08:00:: .
I heard o ' Texas---texas%1:15:00:: cattlemen---cattleman%1:18:01:: wrappin ' a cow---cow%1:05:01:: thief---thief%1:18:00:: up in green hides---hide%1:27:00:: and lettin ' the sun---sun%1:17:00:: shrink ' em and squeeze him to death---death%1:28:01:: .
But there 's one thing---thing%1:11:00:: I never seen or heard of , one thing---thing%1:11:00:: I just do n't think there is , and that 's a sportin ' way---way%1:04:01:: o ' killin ' a man---man%1:18:00:: '' !
After the first two murders---murder%1:04:00:: , the warning---warning%1:10:00:: notes---note%1:10:03:: were rarely ignored .
The lesson---lesson%1:10:00:: had been learned .
The examples---example%1:10:00:: were plain .
When Fred Powell---person%1:03:00:: 's brother-in-law---brother-in-law%1:18:00:: , Charlie Keane---person%1:03:00:: , moved into the dead man---man%1:18:00:: 's home---home%1:06:00:: , the anonymous letter writer---letter_writer%1:18:00:: took no chances on Charlie---person%1:03:00:: taking up where Fred---person%1:03:00:: had left off and wasted no time---time%1:28:05:: on a first notice---notice%1:10:01:: :
If you do n't leave this country---country%1:15:02:: within 3 days---day%1:28:00:: , your life---life%1:26:00:: will be taken the same as Powell---person%1:03:00:: 's was .
This was the message---message%1:10:01:: found tacked to the cabin---cabin%1:06:02:: door---door%1:06:00:: .
Keane---person%1:03:00:: left , within three days---day%1:28:00:: .
All through Albany---location%1:03:00:: and Laramie---location%1:03:00:: counties---county%1:15:00:: , other men---man%1:18:00:: were doing the same .
Houses---house%1:06:00:: of settlers---settler%1:18:00:: who 'd treated the company---company%1:14:01:: herds---herd%1:14:00:: as a natural resource---natural_resource%1:21:00:: , free for the taking , were sitting empty , with weeds---weed%1:20:00:: growing high in their yards---yard%1:06:02:: .
The small half-heartedly tended fields---field%1:15:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: who 'd spent more time---time%1:28:05:: rustling cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: than farming were lying fallow .
No cow---cow%1:05:01:: thief---thief%1:18:00:: could count on a jury---jury%1:14:00:: of his sympathetic peers---peer%1:18:00:: to free him any longer .
Jury---jury%1:14:00:: , judge---judge%1:18:00:: and executioner---executioner%1:18:00:: were riding the range---range%1:15:02:: in the form---form%1:08:00:: of a single unknown figure---figure%1:08:00:: that could materialize anywhere , at any time---time%1:11:00:: , to dispense an ancient brand---brand%1:09:00:: of justice---justice%1:04:00:: the men---man%1:18:04:: of the new West---west%1:15:01:: had believed long outdated .
For three straight years---year%1:28:01:: , Tom Horn---person%1:03:00:: patrolled the southern Wyoming---wyoming%1:15:00:: pastures---pasture%1:15:00:: , and how many men---man%1:18:00:: he killed after Lewis---person%1:03:00:: and Powell---person%1:03:00:: ( if he killed Lewis---person%1:03:00:: and Powell---person%1:03:00:: ) will never be known .
It is possible , although highly doubtful , that he killed none at all but merely let his reputation---reputation%1:26:01:: work for him by privately claiming every unsolved murder---murder%1:04:00:: in the state---state%1:15:01:: .
It is also possible , but equally doubtful , that he actually shot down the hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: with which his legend---legend%1:10:01:: credits him .
For that legend---legend%1:10:01:: was growing explosively , Rumor---rumor%1:10:00:: was insisting he received a price---price%1:10:00:: of $ 600 a man---man%1:18:00:: .
( The best evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: is that he received a monthly wage---wage%1:21:00:: of about $ 125 , very good money---money%1:21:00:: in an era---era%1:28:00:: when top hands---hand%1:18:00:: worked for $ 30 and found---found%1:21:00:: . )
Rumor---rumor%1:10:00:: had it he slipped two small rocks---rock%1:17:01:: under each victim---victim%1:18:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: as a sort---sort%1:09:00:: of trademark---trademark%1:07:00:: .
( A detailed search---search%1:04:02:: of old coroner---coroner%1:18:00:: 's reports---report%1:10:03:: fails to substantiate this in the slightest . )
One thing---thing%1:26:00:: was certain - his method---method%1:09:00:: was effective , so effective that after a time---time%1:28:05:: even the warning---warning%1:10:00:: notices---notice%1:10:01:: were often unnecessary .
The mere fact---fact%1:09:01:: that the tall figure---figure%1:08:00:: with the rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: and field glasses---field_glasses%1:06:00:: had been seen riding that way---way%1:15:00:: was enough---enough%1:23:00:: to frighten three rustling homesteaders---homesteader%1:18:00:: out of the Upper Laramie---location%1:03:00:: country---country%1:15:02:: in a single week---week%1:28:00:: .
`` My reputation---reputation%1:26:01:: 's my stock---stock%1:06:00:: in trade---trade%1:04:05:: '' , Tom---person%1:03:00:: mentioned more than once .
He evidently could n't foresee that it might be his downfall---downfall%1:11:01:: in the end .
He had made himself the personification---personification%1:18:00:: of the Devil to the homesteaders---homesteader%1:18:00:: .
But to the cattlemen---cattleman%1:18:01:: who had been facing bankruptcy---bankruptcy%1:26:00:: from rustling---rustling%1:04:00:: losses---losses%1:21:00:: and to the cowboys---cowboy%1:18:00:: who had been faced with lay-offs---layoff%1:04:00:: a few years---year%1:28:01:: earlier , he was becoming a vastly different type---type%1:09:00:: of legendary figure---figure%1:18:00:: .
Such ranchers---rancher%1:18:00:: as Coble---person%1:03:00:: and Clay---person%1:03:00:: and the Bosler---person%1:03:00:: brothers---brother%1:18:00:: carried him on their books---book%1:10:02:: as a cowhand---cowhand%1:18:00:: even while he was receiving a much larger salary---salary%1:21:00:: from parties---party%1:14:02:: unknown .
He made their spreads---spread%1:06:01:: his headquarters---headquarters%1:06:01:: , and he helped out in their roundups---roundup%1:04:01:: .
In the cow---cow%1:05:01:: camps---camp%1:14:00:: , Tom Horn---person%1:03:00:: was regarded as a hero---hero%1:18:01:: , as the same kind---kind%1:09:00:: of champion---champion%1:18:00:: he was when he entered and invariably won the local rodeos---rodeo%1:04:00:: .
The hands---hand%1:18:00:: and their bosses---boss%1:18:01:: saw him as a lone knight---knight%1:18:00:: of the range---range%1:15:02:: , waging a dedicated crusade---crusade%1:04:00:: against a lawless new society---society%1:14:00:: that was threatening a beloved way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: .
The wailing , guitar---guitar%1:06:00:: strumming minstrels---minstrel%1:18:00:: of the cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: kingdom---kingdom%1:26:00:: made up songs---song%1:10:00:: about him .
By 1898 , rustling---rustling%1:04:00:: losses---losses%1:21:00:: had been driven down to the lowest level---level%1:07:00:: ever seen in Wyoming---wyoming%1:15:00:: .
When Harold Arlen---person%1:03:00:: returned to California---california%1:15:00:: in the winter---winter%1:28:00:: of 1944 , it was to take up again a collaboration---collaboration%1:04:01:: with Johnny Mercer---person%1:03:00:: , begun some years---year%1:28:01:: before .
The film---film%1:10:01:: they did after his return---return%1:11:02:: was an inconsequential bit---bit%1:23:01:: of nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: titled Out of This World , a satire---satire%1:10:00:: on the Sinatra---person%1:03:00:: bobby-soxer---bobbysoxer%1:18:00:: craze---craze%1:09:00:: .
The twist---twist%1:04:01:: lay in using Bing Crosby---person%1:03:00:: 's voice---voice%1:07:00:: on the sound track---soundtrack%1:06:00:: while leading man---leading_man%1:18:00:: Eddie Bracken---person%1:03:00:: mouthed the words---words%1:10:02:: .
If nothing else , at least two good songs---song%1:10:00:: came out of the project---project%1:04:00:: , `` Out of This World '' and `` June Comes Around Every Year '' .
Though they would produce some very memorable and lasting songs---song%1:10:00:: , Arlen---person%1:03:00:: and Mercer---person%1:03:00:: were not given strong material---material%1:10:00:: to work on .
Their first collaboration---collaboration%1:04:01:: came close .
Early in 1941 they were assigned to a script---script%1:10:00:: titled Hot Nocturne .
It purported to be a reasonably serious attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: at a treatment---treatment%1:07:00:: of jazz musicians---jazz_musician%1:18:00:: , their aims---aim%1:09:01:: , their problems---problem%1:26:00:: - the tug-of-war---tug-of-war%1:04:00:: between the `` pure '' and the `` commercial '' - and seemed a promising vehicle---vehicle%1:10:00:: , for the two men---man%1:18:00:: shared a common interest---interest%1:09:00:: in jazz .
Johnny Mercer---person%1:03:00:: practically grew up with the sound---sound%1:07:00:: of jazz and the blues---blues%1:10:00:: in his ears---ear%1:08:00:: .
He was born in savannah---savannah%1:15:00:: , Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: , in 1909 .
His father---father%1:18:00:: , George A. Mercer---person%1:03:00:: , was descended from an honored Southern family---family%1:14:01:: that could trace its ancestry---ancestry%1:14:00:: back to one Hugh Mercer---person%1:03:00:: , who had emigrated from Scotland---scotland%1:15:00:: in 1747 .
The lyricist---lyricist%1:18:00:: 's father---father%1:18:00:: was a lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: who had branched out into real estate---real_estate%1:21:00:: .
His second wife---wife%1:18:00:: , Lillian---person%1:03:00:: , was the mother---mother%1:18:00:: of John H. Mercer---person%1:03:00:: .
By the age---age%1:07:00:: of six---six%1:23:00:: young Johnny---person%1:03:00:: indicated that he had the call---call%1:09:00:: .
One day---day%1:28:03:: he followed the Irish Jasper Greens , the town---town%1:15:00:: band---band%1:14:00:: , to a picnic---picnic%1:28:00:: and spent the entire day---day%1:28:00:: listening , while his family---family%1:14:00:: spent the day---day%1:28:00:: looking .
The disappearance---disappearance%1:04:00:: caused his family---family%1:14:00:: to assign a full-time maid---maid%1:18:01:: to keeping an eye on the boy---boy%1:18:00:: .
But one afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: Mrs. Mercer---person%1:03:00:: met her ; both were obviously on the way to the Mercer---person%1:03:00:: home---home%1:15:04:: .
The mother---mother%1:18:00:: inquired , `` Where 's Johnny---person%1:03:00:: , and why did you leave him '' ?
`` There was nothing else I could do '' , the maid---maid%1:18:01:: answered , satisfied with a rather vague explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: .
But Mrs. Mercer---person%1:03:00:: demanded more .
The maid---maid%1:18:01:: then told her , `` Because he fired me '' .
With her son---son%1:18:00:: evidencing so strong a musical bent---bent%1:09:01:: his mother---mother%1:18:00:: could do little else but get him started on the study---study%1:09:03:: of music---music%1:10:00:: - though she waited until he was ten - beginning with the piano---piano%1:06:00:: and following that with the trumpet---trumpet%1:06:00:: .
Young Mercer---person%1:03:00:: showed a remarkable lack---lack%1:26:00:: of aptitude---aptitude%1:09:00:: for both instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: .
Still , he did like music---music%1:10:00:: making---making%1:04:00:: and even sang in the chapel---chapel%1:06:00:: choir---choir%1:14:00:: of the Woodberry Forest School---group%1:03:00:: , near Orange---location%1:03:00:: , Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: , where he sounded fine but did not matriculate too well .
When he was fifteen John H. Mercer---person%1:03:00:: turned out his first song---song%1:10:00:: , a jazzy little thing---thing%1:06:00:: he called `` Sister Susie , Strut Your Stuff '' .
If his scholarship---scholarship%1:09:00:: and formal musicianship---musicianship%1:09:00:: were not all they might have been , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: demonstrated at an early age---age%1:28:00:: that he was gifted with a remarkable ear---ear%1:09:00:: for rhythm---rhythm%1:10:01:: and dialect---dialect%1:10:00:: .
From his playmates---playmate%1:18:00:: in Savannah---location%1:03:00:: , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: had picked up , along with a soft Southern dialect---dialect%1:10:00:: , traces---trace%1:23:00:: also of the Gullah---location%1:03:00:: dialects---dialect%1:10:00:: of Africa---africa%1:17:00:: .
Such speech---speech%1:10:00:: differences---difference%1:07:00:: made him acutely aware of the richness---richness%1:07:03:: and expressivness---expressiveness%1:07:00:: of language---language%1:10:00:: .
During the summers---summer%1:28:00:: , while he was still in school---school%1:09:00:: , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: worked for his father---father%1:18:00:: 's firm---firm%1:14:00:: as a messenger boy---messenger_boy%1:18:00:: .
It generally took well into the autumn---autumn%1:28:00:: for the firm---firm%1:14:00:: to recover from the summer---summer%1:28:00:: 's help---help%1:04:00:: .
`` We 'd give him things---thing%1:06:00:: to deliver , letters---letter%1:10:00:: , checks---check%1:21:00:: , deeds---deed%1:10:00:: and things---thing%1:06:00:: like that '' , remembers his half-brother---half-brother%1:18:00:: Walter---person%1:03:00:: , still in the real estate---real_estate%1:21:00:: business---business%1:04:00:: in savannah---savannah%1:15:00:: , `` and learn days---day%1:28:00:: later that he 'd absent-mindedly stuffed them into his pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: .
This rather detached attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: toward life---life%1:09:00:: 's encumbrances---encumbrance%1:09:00:: has seemed to be the dominant trait---trait%1:07:00:: in Mercer---person%1:03:00:: 's personality---personality%1:07:00:: ever since .
It is , however , a disarming disguise---disguise%1:07:00:: , or perhaps a shield , for not only has Mercer---person%1:03:00:: proved himself to be one of the few great lyricists---lyricist%1:18:00:: over the years---year%1:28:01:: , but also one who can function remarkably under pressure---pressure%1:26:00:: .
He has also enjoyed a successful career---career%1:04:00:: as an entertainer---entertainer%1:18:00:: ( his records---record%1:06:00:: have sold in the millions---million%1:23:00:: ) and is a sharp businessman---businessman%1:18:00:: .
He has also an extraordinary conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: .
In 1927 his father---father%1:18:00:: 's business---business%1:14:00:: collapsed , and , rather than go bankrupt , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: senior turned his firm---firm%1:14:00:: over to a bank---bank%1:14:00:: for liquidation---liquidation%1:04:00:: .
He died before he could completely pay off his debts---debt%1:21:00:: .
Some years---year%1:28:01:: later the bank---bank%1:14:00:: handling the Mercer---person%1:03:00:: liquidation---liquidation%1:04:00:: received a check---check%1:21:00:: for $ 300000 , enough---enough%1:23:00:: to clear up the debt---debt%1:21:00:: .
The check---check%1:21:00:: had been mailed from Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: , the envelope---envelope%1:06:01:: bore no return address---return_address%1:10:00:: , and the check---check%1:21:00:: was not signed .
`` That 's Johnny---person%1:03:00:: '' , sighed the bank---bank%1:14:00:: president---president%1:18:01:: , `` the best hearted boy---boy%1:18:02:: in the world , but absent-minded '' .
But Mercer---person%1:03:00:: 's explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: was simple : `` I made out the check---check%1:21:00:: and carried it around a few days---day%1:28:00:: unsigned - in case I lost it '' .
When he remembered that he might have not signed the check---check%1:21:00:: , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: made out another for the same amount---amount%1:21:00:: , instructing the bank---bank%1:14:00:: to destroy the other - especially if he had happened to have absent-mindedly signed both of them .
When the family---family%1:14:00:: business---business%1:14:00:: failed , Mercer---mercer%1:18:00:: left school---school%1:09:00:: and on his mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's urging---urging%1:04:00:: - for she hoped that he would become an actor---actor%1:18:00:: - he joined a local little theater---theater%1:10:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: .
When the troupe---troupe%1:14:00:: traveled to New York---new_york%1:15:01:: to participate in a one act---act%1:10:00:: play---play%1:10:03:: competition---competition%1:11:00:: - and won - Mercer---person%1:03:00:: , instead of returning with the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the company---company%1:14:02:: in triumph---triumph%1:12:00:: , remained in New York---new_york%1:15:01:: .
He had talked one other member---member%1:18:00:: of the group---group%1:03:00:: to stay with him , but that friend---friend%1:18:00:: had tired of not eating regularly and returned to Savannah---savannah%1:15:00:: .
But Mercer---person%1:03:00:: hung on , living , after a fashion , in a Greenwich Village---greenwich_village%1:15:00:: fourth flight---flight%1:06:00:: walk-up---walk-up%1:06:00:: .
`` The place---place%1:15:06:: had no sink---sink%1:06:00:: or washbasin---washbasin%1:06:02:: , only a bathtub---bathtub%1:06:00:: '' , his mother---mother%1:18:00:: discovered when she visited him .
`` Johnny---person%1:03:00:: insisted on cooking a chicken---chicken%1:13:00:: dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: in my honor---honor%1:10:00:: - he 's always been a good cook---cook%1:18:00:: - and I 'll never forget him cleaning the chicken---chicken%1:13:00:: in the tub---tub%1:06:01:: '' .
A story---story%1:10:03:: , no doubt apocryphal , for Mercer---person%1:03:00:: himself denies it , has him sporting a monocle---monocle%1:06:00:: in those Village---village%1:15:01:: days---day%1:28:03:: .
Though merely clear glass---glass%1:27:00:: , it was a distinctive trade mark---trademark%1:07:00:: for an aspiring actor---actor%1:18:00:: who hoped to imprint himself upon the memories---memory%1:09:02:: of producers---producer%1:18:02:: .
One day---day%1:28:03:: in a bar---bar%1:06:04:: , so the legend---legend%1:10:01:: goes , someone put a beer---beer%1:13:00:: stein---stein%1:06:00:: with too much force---force%1:07:00:: on the monocle---monocle%1:06:00:: and broke it .
The innocent malfeasant---malfeasant%1:18:00:: , filled with that supreme sense---sense%1:09:05:: of honor---honor%1:07:00:: found in bars---bar%1:06:04:: , insisted upon replacing the destroyed monocle---monocle%1:06:00:: - and did , over the protests---protest%1:10:00:: of the former owner---owner%1:18:00:: - with a square monocle---monocle%1:06:00:: .
Mercer---person%1:03:00:: is supposed to have refused it with , `` Anyone who wears a square monocle---monocle%1:06:00:: must be affected '' !
Everett Miller---person%1:03:00:: , then assistant---assistant%1:18:00:: director---director%1:18:02:: for the Garrick Gaieties , a Theatre Guild---group%1:03:00:: production---production%1:10:00:: , needed a lyricist---lyricist%1:18:00:: for a song---song%1:10:00:: he had written ; he just happened not to need any actor---actor%1:18:00:: at the moment---moment%1:28:00:: , however .
For him Mercer---person%1:03:00:: produced the lyric---lyric%1:10:01:: to `` Out of Breath Scared to Death of You '' , introduced in that most successful of all the Gaieties , by Sterling Holloway---person%1:03:00:: .
This 1930 edition---edition%1:10:02:: also had songs---song%1:10:00:: in it by Vernon Duke---person%1:03:00:: and Ira Gershwin---person%1:03:00:: , by E. Y. Harburg---person%1:03:00:: and Duke---person%1:03:00:: , and by Harry Myers---person%1:03:00:: .
Entrance---entrance%1:11:00:: into such stellar song---song%1:10:00:: writing company---company%1:26:00:: encouraged the burgeoning song writer---songwriter%1:18:00:: to take a wife---wife%1:18:00:: , Elizabeth Meehan---person%1:03:00:: , a dancer---dancer%1:18:00:: in the Gaieties .
The Mercers---person%1:03:00:: took up residence---residence%1:04:00:: in Brooklyn---brooklyn%1:15:00:: , and Mercer---person%1:03:00:: found a regular job---job%1:04:00:: in Wall Street---wall_street%1:15:00:: `` misplacing stocks---stock%1:21:02:: and bonds---bond%1:21:02:: '' .
When he heard that Paul Whiteman---person%1:03:00:: was looking for singers---singer%1:18:00:: to replace the Rhythm Boys , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: applied and got the job---job%1:04:00:: , `` not for my voice---voice%1:07:00:: , I 'm sure , but because I could write songs---song%1:10:00:: and material---material%1:10:00:: generally '' .
While with the Whiteman---person%1:03:00:: band---band%1:14:00:: Mercer---person%1:03:00:: met Jerry Arlen---person%1:03:00:: .
He had yet to meet Harold Arlen---person%1:03:00:: , for although they had `` collaborated '' on `` Satan 's Li ' l Lamb '' , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: and Harburg---person%1:03:00:: had worked from a lead sheet---lead_sheet%1:10:00:: the composer---composer%1:18:00:: had furnished them .
The lyric---lyric%1:10:01:: , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: remembers , was tailored to fit the unusual melody---melody%1:10:00:: .
Mercer---person%1:03:00:: 's Whiteman---person%1:03:00:: association---association%1:04:00:: brought him into contact---contact%1:04:02:: with Hoagy Carmichael---person%1:03:00:: , whose `` Snowball '' Mercer---person%1:03:00:: relyriced as `` Lazybones '' , in which form---form%1:07:01:: it became a hit---hit%1:04:02:: and marked the real beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: of Mercer---person%1:03:00:: 's song---song%1:10:00:: writing career---career%1:04:00:: .
After leaving Whiteman---person%1:03:00:: , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: joined the Benny Goodman---person%1:03:00:: band---band%1:14:00:: as a vocalist---vocalist%1:18:00:: .
With the help---help%1:04:00:: of Ziggy Elman---person%1:03:00:: , also in the band---band%1:14:00:: , he transformed a traditional Jewish melody---melody%1:10:00:: into a popular song---song%1:10:00:: , `` And the Angels Sing '' .
The countrywide success---success%1:11:00:: of `` Lazybones '' and `` And the Angels Sing '' could only lead to Hollywood---hollywood%1:14:00:: , where , besides Harold Arlen---person%1:03:00:: , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: collaborated with Harry Warren---person%1:03:00:: , Jimmy Van Heusen---person%1:03:00:: , Richard Whiting---person%1:03:00:: , Walter Donaldson---person%1:03:00:: , Jerome Kern---person%1:03:00:: , and Arthur Schwartz---person%1:03:00:: .
Mercer---person%1:03:00:: has also written both music---music%1:10:00:: and lyrics---lyric%1:10:01:: for several songs---song%1:10:00:: .
He may be the only song writer---songwriter%1:18:00:: ever to have collaborated with a secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: of the U. S. Treasury---group%1:03:00:: ; he collaborated on a song---song%1:10:00:: with William Hartman Woodin---person%1:03:00:: , who was Secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: of the Treasury---treasury%1:14:00:: , 1932 - 33 .
When Johnny Mercer---person%1:03:00:: and Harold Arlen---person%1:03:00:: began their collaboration---collaboration%1:04:01:: in 1940 , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: , like Arlen---person%1:03:00:: , had several substantial film---film%1:10:01:: songs---song%1:10:00:: to his credit---credit%1:04:01:: , among them `` Hooray for Hollywood '' , `` Ride , Tenderfoot , Ride '' , `` Have You Got Any Castles , Baby ? ''
, and `` Too Marvelous for Words '' ( all with Richard Whiting---person%1:03:00:: ) ; with Harry Warren---person%1:03:00:: he did `` The Girl Friend of the Whirling Dervish '' , `` Jeepers Creepers '' , and `` You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby '' .
Mercer---person%1:03:00:: 's lyrics---lyric%1:10:01:: are characterized by an unerring ear---ear%1:09:00:: for rhythmic nuances---nuance%1:10:00:: , a puckish sense of humor---sense_of_humor%1:07:00:: expressed in language---language%1:10:02:: with a colloquial flair---flair%1:07:00:: .
Though versatile and capable of turning out a ballad---ballad%1:10:01:: lyric---lyric%1:10:01:: with the best of them , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: 's forte---forte%1:07:01:: is a highly polished quasi folk wit---wit%1:10:00:: .
His casual , dreamlike working methods---method%1:09:00:: , often as not in absentia , were an abrupt change---change%1:11:00:: from Harburg---person%1:03:00:: 's , so that Arlen---person%1:03:00:: had to adjust again to another approach---approach%1:04:02:: to collaboration---collaboration%1:04:01:: .
There were times---time%1:11:00:: that he worked with both lyricists---lyricist%1:18:00:: simultaneously .
Speaking of his work---work%1:04:00:: with Johnny Mercer---person%1:03:00:: , Arlen---person%1:03:00:: says , `` Our working habits---habit%1:04:02:: were strange .
After we got a script---script%1:10:00:: and the spots---spot%1:10:00:: for the songs---song%1:10:00:: were blocked out , we 'd get together for an hour---hour%1:28:00:: or so every day .
While Johnny---person%1:03:00:: made himself comfortable on the couch---couch%1:06:00:: , I 'd play the tunes---tune%1:10:00:: for him .
He has a wonderfully retentive memory---memory%1:09:00:: .
After I would finish playing the songs---song%1:10:00:: , he 'd just go away without a comment---comment%1:10:00:: .
I would n't hear from him for a couple of weeks---week%1:28:00:: , then he 'd come around with the completed lyric---lyric%1:10:01:: '' .
Arlen---person%1:03:00:: is one of the few ( possibly the only ) composer---composer%1:18:00:: Mercer---person%1:03:00:: has been able to work with so closely , for they held their meetings---meeting%1:14:00:: in Arlen---person%1:03:00:: 's study---study%1:06:00:: .
`` Some guys---guy%1:18:00:: bothered me '' , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: has said .
`` I could n't write with them in the same room---room%1:06:00:: with me , but I could with Harold---person%1:03:00:: .
He is probably our most original composer---composer%1:18:00:: ; he often uses very odd rhythms---rhythm%1:10:01:: , which makes it difficult , and challenging , for the lyric---lyric%1:10:01:: writer---writer%1:18:00:: '' .
While Arlen---person%1:03:00:: and Mercer---person%1:03:00:: collaborated on Hot Nocturne , Mercer---person%1:03:00:: worked also with Arthur Schwartz---person%1:03:00:: on another film---film%1:10:01:: , Navy Blues .
Arlen---person%1:03:00:: , too , worked on other projects---project%1:04:00:: at the same time with old friend---friend%1:18:00:: Ted Koehler---person%1:03:00:: .
Besides doing a single song---song%1:10:00:: , `` When the Sun Comes Out '' , they worked on the ambitious Americanegro Suite , for voices---voice%1:18:01:: and piano---piano%1:06:00:: , as well as songs---song%1:10:00:: for films---film%1:10:01:: .
The Americanegro Suite is in a sense an extension---extension%1:10:01:: of the Cotton Club songs---song%1:10:00:: in that it is a collection---collection%1:14:00:: of Negro---negro%1:18:00:: songs---song%1:10:00:: , not for a night club---nightclub%1:06:00:: , but for the concert---concert%1:10:00:: stage---stage%1:06:00:: .
The work---work%1:06:00:: had its beginning---beginning%1:28:00:: in 1938 with an eight bar---bar%1:10:00:: musical strain---strain%1:10:00:: to which Koehler---person%1:03:00:: set the words---words%1:10:02:: `` There 'll be no more work---work%1:04:00:: / There 'll be no more worry---worry%1:12:00:: '' , matching the spiritual feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: of the jot---jot%1:10:00:: .
This grew into the song---song%1:10:00:: `` Big Time Comin '' ' .
By September---september%1:28:00:: 1940 the suite---suite%1:10:00:: had developed into a collection---collection%1:14:00:: of six songs---song%1:10:00:: , `` four spirituals---spiritual%1:10:00:: , a dream---dream%1:09:01:: , and a lullaby---lullaby%1:10:00:: '' .
The Negro composer---composer%1:18:00:: Hall Johnson---person%1:03:00:: studied the Americanegro Suite and said of it , `` Of all the many songs---song%1:10:00:: written by white composers---composer%1:18:00:: and employing what claims to be a Negroid idiom---idiom%1:10:00:: in both words---words%1:10:02:: and music---music%1:10:00:: , these six songs---song%1:10:00:: by Harold Arlen---person%1:03:00:: and Ted Koehler---person%1:03:00:: easily stand far out above the rest---rest%1:24:00:: .
Thoroughly modern in treatment---treatment%1:07:00:: , they are at the same time , full of simple sincerity---sincerity%1:07:02:: which invariably characterizes genuine Negro folk-music---folk_music%1:10:00:: and are by no means to be confused with the average ' Broadway---broadway%1:15:00:: Spirituals---spiritual%1:10:00:: ' which depend for their racial flavor---flavor%1:26:00:: upon sundry allusions---allusion%1:10:00:: to the ' Amen Corner---amen_corner%1:06:00:: ' , ' judgement day---judgement_day%1:28:00:: ' , ' Gabriel---person%1:03:00:: 's horn---horn%1:06:01:: ' , and a frustrated devil---devil%1:18:02:: - with a few random ' Hallelujahs---hallelujah%1:10:00:: ' thrown in for good measure .
The Brannon---person%1:03:00:: outfit---outfit%1:14:00:: - known as the Slash-B---group%1:03:00:: because of its brand---brand%1:10:02:: - reached Hondo Creek---location%1:03:00:: before sundown---sundown%1:28:00:: .
The herd---herd%1:14:00:: was watered and then thrown onto a broad grass---grass%1:20:00:: flat---flat%1:17:00:: which was to be the first night---night%1:28:00:: 's bedground---bedground%1:15:00:: .
Two---two%1:23:00:: of the new hands---hand%1:18:00:: , a Mexican---mexican%1:18:00:: named Jose Amado---person%1:03:00:: and a kid---kid%1:18:00:: known only as Laredo---person%1:03:00:: , were picked for the first trick---trick%1:28:00:: of riding night---night%1:28:00:: herd .
The rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the crew---crew%1:14:00:: offsaddled their mounts---mount%1:05:00:: and turned them into the remuda---remuda%1:14:00:: .
They got tin---tin%1:27:00:: cups---cup%1:06:00:: of coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: from the big pot---pot%1:06:00:: on the coosie 's fire---fire%1:11:00:: , rolled and lighted brown paper---paper%1:27:00:: cigarettes---cigarette%1:06:00:: , lounged about .
There was some idle talk---idle_talk%1:10:00:: , a listless discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: of this or that small happening---happening%1:11:00:: during the day---day%1:28:02:: 's drive---drive%1:04:06:: .
But they deliberately avoided the one subject---subject%1:09:01:: that had them all curious :
But they deliberately avoided the one subject---subject%1:10:00:: that had them all curious :
the failure---failure%1:04:00:: of the boss---boss%1:18:00:: 's wife---wife%1:18:00:: and son---son%1:18:00:: to join the outfit---outfit%1:14:00:: .
It especially bothered the older hands---hand%1:18:00:: .
The cook---cook%1:18:00:: , Mateo Garcia---person%1:03:00:: , had arrived there long before the herd---herd%1:14:00:: .
He 'd started a fire---fire%1:11:00:: and put coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: on , and now was busy at the work board---workboard%1:06:00:: of his chuck wagon---chuck_wagon%1:06:00:: .
He was readying a batch---batch%1:14:01:: of sourdough biscuits---biscuit%1:13:00:: for the Dutch oven---dutch_oven%1:06:00:: .
Supper---supper%1:13:00:: would be ready within the hour---hour%1:28:00:: .
The Maguire---person%1:03:00:: family---family%1:14:00:: was setting up a separate camp---camp%1:06:01:: nearby .
Billie---person%1:03:00:: had unhitched the mules---mule%1:05:00:: from both Tom Brannon---person%1:03:00:: 's and his father---father%1:18:00:: 's wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: .
Hank---person%1:03:00:: had gathered wood---wood%1:27:00:: for a cookfire---cookfire%1:06:00:: , and his wife---wife%1:18:00:: was busy at it now .
Conchita---person%1:03:00:: kept an eye on the twins---twin%1:18:00:: and little Elena---person%1:03:00:: , trying to keep them from falling into the creek---creek%1:17:00:: by which they persisted in playing .
Conchita---person%1:03:00:: nagged at the younger children---child%1:18:00:: , attempting without success---success%1:04:00:: to keep her thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: off Tom Brannon---person%1:03:00:: .
Tom Brannon---person%1:03:00:: had caught up with the outfit---outfit%1:14:00:: shortly after the Maguires---person%1:03:00:: joined it , which had been at midday---midday%1:28:00:: .
He 'd come alone , without his wife---wife%1:18:00:: and child---child%1:18:00:: .
He 'd been in an angry mood---mood%1:12:00:: : Conchita---person%1:03:00:: had thought his face---face%1:07:00:: almost ugly with the anger---anger%1:12:00:: in him .
She wondered what had taken place in town---town%1:15:00:: , between him and his wife---wife%1:18:00:: .
She wished that she could talk to her mother---mother%1:18:00:: about it .
Not that her mother---mother%1:18:00:: knew what had happened , but they could speculate upon it .
But her mother---mother%1:18:00:: would rebuke her if she mentioned it , and say that it was none of her concern---concern%1:09:00:: .
`` Pat---person%1:03:00:: , get out of that creek---creek%1:17:00:: !
You too , Sean---person%1:03:00:: !
Elena---person%1:03:00:: , you 'll get mud---mud%1:27:00:: all over your dress---dress%1:06:00:: '' !
Even as she called to the children---child%1:18:00:: , Conchita---person%1:03:00:: let her gaze---gaze%1:04:00:: seek Tom Brannon---person%1:03:00:: .
Tomas---person%1:03:00:: , she called him - as the Mexican hands---hand%1:18:00:: did .
He was in earnest conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: with her father---father%1:18:00:: and the old vaquero---vaquero%1:18:00:: , Luis Hernandez---person%1:03:00:: .
Conchita---person%1:03:00:: wondered .
Certainly , she would n't dare ask her father---father%1:18:00:: afterward .
He would tell her not to pry into grownups---grownup%1:18:01:: ' affairs---affairs%1:09:00:: - as though she were a little kid---kid%1:18:00:: like Elena---person%1:03:00:: !
At the moment---moment%1:28:00:: , the three men---man%1:18:00:: were not saying much---much%1:23:00:: of anything .
They were sitting on their heels---heel%1:08:00:: , rider---rider%1:18:00:: fashion---fashion%1:07:00:: , over by the still empty calf---calf%1:05:00:: wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: .
Brannon---person%1:03:00:: was hunkered down with his broad back---back%1:08:00:: to the left rear wheel---wheel%1:06:00:: , with the other two facing him .
He held a cigarette---cigarette%1:06:00:: in his right hand---right_hand%1:08:00:: .
His face---face%1:07:00:: was clouded with unhappiness---unhappiness%1:12:00:: .
He 'd told Hank Maguire---person%1:03:00:: and Luis Hernandez---person%1:03:00:: about his wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's refusal---refusal%1:10:01:: to come with him and about what he now intended to do .
Finally Hernandez---person%1:03:00:: said , `` I could offer you advice---advice%1:10:00:: , Tomas---person%1:03:00:: , but you would n't heed it '' .
`` Wait a little while---while%1:28:00:: .
Let Senora Brannon---person%1:03:00:: live in her father---father%1:18:00:: 's house---house%1:06:00:: for a time---time%1:28:05:: .
Give her time---time%1:28:05:: to miss you .
After all , you want the senora as much as you want the boy---boy%1:18:03:: .
`` She won n't change her mind---mind%1:09:04:: '' , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` John Clayton---person%1:03:00:: will see to that '' .
`` But after a time---time%1:28:05:: away from you & & & '' .
`` A year---year%1:28:01:: , Luis---person%1:03:00:: ?
`` Maybe in a year---year%1:28:01:: , Tomas---person%1:03:00:: & & & '' .
`` In a year---year%1:28:01:: she 'll like living in Clayton---person%1:03:00:: 's house---house%1:06:00:: too much to come back to me '' , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: said flatly .
`` And the boy---boy%1:18:03:: will be too much under his influence---influence%1:07:00:: by then---then%1:28:00:: .
I 've got to take Danny---person%1:03:00:: away from Clayton---person%1:03:00:: before I lose him altogether .
Hell , in a year---year%1:28:01:: or five or ten---ten%1:23:00:: , the boy---boy%1:18:03:: will have forgotten me - his own father---father%1:18:00:: '' !
`` But to take him and leave his mother---mother%1:18:00:: behind is not good '' .
`` In my place---place%1:26:01:: , you 'd follow such advice---advice%1:10:00:: as you give me '' ?
Hernandez---person%1:03:00:: looked suddenly uncertain .
Maybe I should withdraw my advice---advice%1:10:00:: - no '' ?
Brannon---person%1:03:00:: looked at Hank Maguire---person%1:03:00:: .
What would you do in my place---place%1:26:01:: '' ?
Hank---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
`` I do n't know , Tom---person%1:03:00:: .
Like Luis---person%1:03:00:: , I can n't see something like this happening to me .
With Maria---person%1:03:00:: and me , there 's never any problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
Where I go , she goes - and the kids---kid%1:18:00:: with us .
You 're going to need your woman---woman%1:18:01:: .
And the boy---boy%1:18:00:: will need his mother---mother%1:18:00:: .
Brannon---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
`` I won n't force Beth---person%1:03:00:: to come against her will---will%1:09:00:: .
But I 'm going to have my son---son%1:18:00:: '' .
They were silent for a little while---while%1:28:00:: , each looking glum .
Finally Luis Hernandez---person%1:03:00:: said , `` What must be , must be .
I am with you , of course , Tomas---person%1:03:00:: '' .
And Hank Maguire---person%1:03:00:: added , `` So am I , Tom---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` All right '' , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: said , rising .
`` We 'll ride out as soon as we 've had chuck---chuck%1:13:02:: '' .
Brannon---person%1:03:00:: timed it so that they rode in an hour---hour%1:28:00:: after nightfall---nightfall%1:28:00:: .
They had for cover---cover%1:06:02:: both darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: and a summer---summer%1:28:00:: storm---storm%1:19:00:: .
During much---much%1:23:00:: of the fifteen mile---mile%1:23:01:: ride---ride%1:04:00:: they had watched a lurid display---display%1:10:01:: of lightning---lightning%1:19:00:: in the sky---sky%1:17:00:: to the east---east%1:24:00:: .
Later , they 'd heard the rumble---rumble%1:11:00:: of thunder---thunder%1:11:01:: and then , just outside Rockfork---location%1:03:00:: , they ran into rain---rain%1:19:00:: .
Those who had slickers---slicker%1:06:00:: donned them .
The others put on old coats---coat%1:06:00:: or ducking---ducking%1:04:01:: jackets---jacket%1:06:00:: , whichever they carried behind their saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: cantles---cantle%1:06:00:: .
There were seven---seven%1:23:00:: of them , enough---enough%1:23:00:: for a show---show%1:10:03:: of strength---strength%1:07:05:: - to run a bluff---bluff%1:10:00:: .
It was to be nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: more than that .
There was to be no gunplay---gunplay%1:04:00:: .
If the bluff---bluff%1:10:00:: failed and they ran into trouble---trouble%1:11:00:: , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: had told the others , they would withdraw - and he would come after his son---son%1:18:00:: another time---time%1:11:00:: .
He did n't want to put himself outside the law---law%1:14:00:: .
With him were Hank Maguire---person%1:03:00:: , Luis Hernandez---person%1:03:00:: , and Luis---person%1:03:00:: 's son---son%1:18:00:: Pedro---person%1:03:00:: .
The Ramirez---person%1:03:00:: brothers---brother%1:18:00:: were also along .
The seventh man---man%1:18:00:: was Red Hogan---person%1:03:00:: , a wiry little puncher---puncher%1:18:00:: with a wild streak---streak%1:07:01:: and a liking---liking%1:12:00:: for hell raising---hell_raising%1:04:00:: .
They were all good men---man%1:18:00:: .
It was dark early , because of the storm---storm%1:19:00:: .
Also because of the storm---storm%1:19:00:: , the streets---street%1:06:00:: of Rockfork---location%1:03:00:: were deserted .
Lighted windows---window%1:06:00:: glowed jewel---jewel%1:06:00:: bright through the downpour---downpour%1:19:00:: .
They reined in before the town---town%1:15:01:: marshal---marshal%1:18:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: , a box---box%1:06:00:: sized building---building%1:06:00:: on Main Street---location%1:03:00:: .
A lamp---lamp%1:06:00:: burned inside , but Brannon---person%1:03:00:: , peering through the window---window%1:06:00:: , saw that the office---office%1:06:00:: was empty .
He 'd hoped to catch Jesse Macklin---person%1:03:00:: there .
`` Maybe to have supper---supper%1:13:00:: .
Red---person%1:03:00:: , come along .
The rest---rest%1:24:00:: of you wait here '' .
With Red Hogan---person%1:03:00:: , he rode to the Welcome Cafe---location%1:03:00:: .
Hogan---person%1:03:00:: got down from the saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: and had a look inside .
`` Not there '' , he said , getting back onto his horse---horse%1:05:00:: .
`` Maybe he 's at the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: '' .
They rode to the Rockfork House---location%1:03:00:: , a little farther along the opposite side---side%1:15:02:: of the street---street%1:06:00:: .
They reined in there , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: remaining in the saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: while Hogan---person%1:03:00:: went to look for Jesse Macklin---person%1:03:00:: in the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: dining room---dining_room%1:06:00:: .
Brannon---person%1:03:00:: had no slicker---slicker%1:06:00:: .
He 'd put on his old brown corduroy---corduroy%1:06:00:: coat---coat%1:06:00:: and it was already soaked .
But he felt no physical discomfort---discomfort%1:26:00:: .
He was only vaguely aware of the sluicing rain---rain%1:19:00:: .
He hardly noticed the blue green flashes---flash%1:11:00:: of lightning---lightning%1:19:00:: and the hard claps---clap%1:11:00:: of thunder---thunder%1:11:01:: .
Hogan---person%1:03:00:: reappeared , stopped on the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: porch---porch%1:06:00:: , lifted a hand---hand%1:08:00:: in signal---signal%1:10:00:: .
Brannon---person%1:03:00:: dismounted and climbed the steps---steps%1:06:00:: .
`` He 's finished eating '' , Hogan---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Sitting with a cup---cup%1:06:00:: of coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: now .
It seemed long , at least to Tom Brannon---person%1:03:00:: .
He and Hogan---person%1:03:00:: waited by the door---door%1:06:01:: , one to either side---side%1:15:02:: .
Macklin---person%1:03:00:: was the third man---man%1:18:00:: to come out , and he came unhurriedly .
He was puffing on a cigar---cigar%1:06:00:: , and he was turning up his coat---coat%1:06:00:: collar---collar%1:06:00:: against the rain---rain%1:19:00:: .
It was not until he moved across the porch---porch%1:06:00:: that he became aware of them , and then it was too late .
They closed in fast , kept him from reaching inside his coat---coat%1:06:00:: for his gun---gun%1:06:00:: .
`` Just come along '' , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: told him .
`` Now , listen '' - Macklin---person%1:03:00:: began .
`` We 'll talk over at your office---office%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Brannon---person%1:03:00:: , I warn you '' !
`` Let 's go , Marsh al---marshal%1:18:00:: '' , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: said , and took him by the arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
Hogan---person%1:03:00:: gripped the lawman---lawman%1:18:00:: 's other arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
They escorted him down from the porch---porch%1:06:00:: and through the rain---rain%1:19:00:: to his office---office%1:06:00:: .
The other five Slash-B---group%1:03:00:: men---man%1:18:00:: followed them inside , crowding the small room---room%1:06:00:: .
His face---face%1:07:00:: was stiff with anger---anger%1:12:00:: when they let go of his arms---arm%1:08:00:: .
He looked at each of them in turn , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: last of all .
`` Every last one---one%1:09:00:: of you .
As for you , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: '' -
`` Put your gun---gun%1:06:00:: on the desk---desk%1:06:00:: , Marshal---marshal%1:18:00:: '' .
Red Hogan---person%1:03:00:: 's patience---patience%1:07:00:: ran out .
He lifted the skirt---skirt%1:06:01:: of Macklin---person%1:03:00:: 's coat---coat%1:06:00:: , took his gun---gun%1:06:00:: from its holster---holster%1:06:00:: , tossed it onto the desk---desk%1:06:00:: .
`` Do n't press your luck , badge---badge%1:10:00:: toter---toter%1:18:00:: '' .
Brannon---person%1:03:00:: said , `` Now the key---key%1:06:00:: to the lockup---lockup%1:06:00:: , Marshal---marshal%1:18:00:: '' .
`` Key---key%1:06:00:: '' ?
Macklin---person%1:03:00:: said .
Brannon---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` We 're putting you where you won n't come to harm---harm%1:26:00:: .
Come on - the key---key%1:06:00:: .
Brannon---person%1:03:00:: , you 've assaulted a law officer---law_officer%1:18:00:: and '' -
They moved in on him , crowded him from all sides---side%1:15:02:: .
No man---man%1:18:00:: laid a hand---hand%1:08:00:: on him , but the threat---threat%1:26:00:: of violence---violence%1:04:01:: was there .
His face---face%1:07:00:: took on a sudden pallor---pallor%1:07:00:: , became beaded with sweat---sweat%1:08:00:: , and he seemed to have trouble---trouble%1:04:02:: with his breathing---breathing%1:04:00:: .
He held out a moment---moment%1:28:01:: longer , then his nerve---nerve%1:07:00:: gave under the pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: .
It 's here in my pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Get it out '' , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: ordered .
Then , as Macklin---person%1:03:00:: obeyed : `` Now let 's go out back '' .
Resignedly , Macklin---person%1:03:00:: turned to the back door---door%1:06:01:: .
They followed him into the rain and across to the squat stone building fifty feet to the rear---rear%1:15:00:: .
They followed him into the rain---rain%1:19:00:: and across to the squat stone---stone%1:17:00:: building---building%1:06:00:: fifty feet---foot%1:23:00:: to the rear---rear%1:15:01:: .
The door---door%1:06:00:: of the lockup---lockup%1:06:00:: was of oak---oak%1:20:02:: planks---plank%1:27:00:: and banded with strap---strap%1:06:01:: iron---iron%1:27:00:: .
It was secured by an oversized padlock---padlock%1:06:00:: .
Macklin---person%1:03:00:: balked again , not wanting to unlock and open the door---door%1:06:00:: .
They crowded him in that threatening way---way%1:07:01:: once more , forced him to give in .
Once the door---door%1:06:00:: was open , they crowded him inside the dark building---building%1:06:00:: .
He was uttering threats---threat%1:10:00:: in a low but savage voice---voice%1:10:00:: when they closed and padlocked the door---door%1:06:00:: .
They returned to the street---street%1:06:00:: , mounted their horses---horse%1:05:00:: , rode through the rain---rain%1:19:00:: to the big house---house%1:06:00:: on Houston Street---location%1:03:00:: .
Its windows---window%1:06:00:: glowed with lamplight---lamplight%1:19:00:: .
Deputy Marshal Luke Harper---person%1:03:00:: still stood guard on the veranda---veranda%1:06:00:: , a forlorn , scarecrowish figure---figure%1:08:00:: in the murky dark---dark%1:15:00:: .
He came to the edge---edge%1:15:00:: of the veranda---veranda%1:06:00:: , peered down at them with his hand---hand%1:08:00:: on his gun---gun%1:06:00:: .
`` Do n't try it '' , Brannon---person%1:03:00:: told him , dismounting and starting up the steps---steps%1:06:00:: with his men---men%1:14:00:: following .
He strode past the now frightened man---man%1:18:00:: , entered the house---house%1:06:00:: .
Miguel---person%1:03:00:: and Arturo Ramirez---person%1:03:00:: remained on the veranda---veranda%1:06:00:: to keep Harper---person%1:03:00:: from interfering .
The others followed Brannon---person%1:03:00:: inside .
They trailed him across the wide hallway---hallway%1:06:00:: to the parlor---parlor%1:06:00:: , four roughly garbed and tough looking men---man%1:18:00:: who probably had never before ventured into such a house---house%1:06:00:: .
They brought to it all the odors---odor%1:07:00:: that clung to men---man%1:18:00:: like themselves , that of their own sweat---sweat%1:08:00:: , of campfire---campfire%1:11:00:: smoke---smoke%1:22:00:: , of horses---horse%1:05:00:: and cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: .
They tracked mud---mud%1:27:00:: on the oaken floor---floor%1:06:00:: , on the carpet---carpet%1:06:00:: .
Their presence---presence%1:26:00:: fouled the elegance---elegance%1:07:00:: of that room---room%1:06:00:: .
And their arrival---arrival%1:04:00:: caught John Clayton---person%1:03:00:: and Charles Ansley---person%1:03:00:: off guard .
In addition to the penalties---penalty%1:04:00:: provided in title---title%1:10:05:: 18 , United States---united_states%1:14:00:: Code---code%1:10:01:: , section---section%1:10:00:: 1001 , any person---person%1:03:00:: guilty of any act---act%1:03:00:: , as provided therein , with respect to any matter---matter%1:09:00:: under this Title---title%1:10:05:: , shall forfeit all rights---right%1:07:00:: under this Title---title%1:10:05:: , and , if payment---payment%1:21:00:: shall have been made or granted , the Commission---commission%1:14:00:: shall take such action---action%1:04:02:: as may be necessary to recover the same .

Every taxpayer---taxpayer%1:18:00:: is well aware of the vast size---size%1:07:00:: of our annual defense---defense%1:04:00:: budget---budget%1:21:02:: and most of our readers---reader%1:18:02:: also realize that a large portion---portion%1:04:00:: of these expenditures---expenditure%1:21:00:: go for military electronics---electronics%1:09:00:: .
We have noted how some electronic techniques---technique%1:09:00:: , developed for the defense---defense%1:04:00:: effort---effort%1:04:00:: , have evenutally been used in commerce---commerce%1:04:00:: and industry---industry%1:04:00:: .
The host---host%1:14:00:: of novel applications---application%1:04:02:: of electronics---electronics%1:09:00:: to medical problems---problem%1:26:00:: is far more thrilling because of their implication---implication%1:09:00:: in matters---matter%1:09:01:: concerning our health---health%1:26:00:: and vitality---vitality%1:26:00:: .

The benefits---benefit%1:07:00:: electronics---electronics%1:09:00:: can bring to bio-medicine---biomedicine%1:09:01:: may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: .
We use the term---term%1:10:00:: `` bio-medicine---biomedicine%1:09:01:: '' because of the close interrelation---interrelation%1:24:00:: between biology---biology%1:09:00:: and medical research---research%1:09:00:: .
Electronics---electronics%1:09:00:: has been applied to medicine---medicine%1:09:00:: for many years---year%1:28:01:: in the form---form%1:09:01:: of such familiar equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: as the x-ray machine---x-ray_machine%1:06:00:: , the electrocardiograph---electrocardiograph%1:06:00:: , and the diathermy machine---diathermy_machine%1:06:00:: .
Recently many doctors---doctor%1:18:00:: have installed ultrasonic vibration---vibration%1:04:00:: machines---machine%1:06:00:: for deep massage---massage%1:04:00:: of bruises---bruise%1:26:00:: , contusions---contusion%1:26:00:: , and simple bursitis---bursitis%1:26:00:: .
Commonly used electronic devices---electronic_device%1:06:00:: which are found in practically every hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: are closed-circuit---closed_circuit%1:06:00:: TV---tv%1:10:00:: and audio systems---audio_system%1:06:00:: for internal paging---paging%1:10:00:: and instruction---instruction%1:10:04:: , along with radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: counters---counter%1:06:01:: , timers---timer%1:06:00:: , and similar devices---device%1:06:00:: .
In this article---article%1:10:00:: we will concentrate on the advances---advance%1:11:01:: in the application---application%1:04:02:: of electronics---electronics%1:09:00:: in bio-medical research---research%1:04:00:: laboratories---laboratory%1:06:00:: because this is where tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:00:: 's commonplace equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: originates .
From the wealth---wealth%1:07:00:: of material---material%1:10:00:: and the wide variety---variety%1:14:01:: of different electronic techniques---technique%1:09:00:: perfected in the past few years---year%1:28:01:: we have selected a few examples---example%1:09:00:: which appear to be headed for use---use%1:04:00:: in the immediate future---future%1:28:00:: and which offer completely new tools---tool%1:06:00:: in medical research---research%1:04:00:: .
Many cells---cell%1:03:00:: , bacteria---bacteria%1:05:00:: , and other microorganisms---microorganism%1:05:00:: are transparent to visible light---visible_light%1:19:00:: and must be stained for microscopic investigation---investigation%1:04:00:: .
This stain---stain%1:27:00:: often disrupts the normal cell---cell%1:03:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: or else colors only the outside---outside%1:15:00:: .
A completely new insight---insight%1:09:01:: into living cells---cell%1:03:00:: and their structure---structure%1:07:00:: will be possible by use---use%1:04:00:: of a new technique---technique%1:09:00:: which replaces visible light---visible_light%1:19:00:: with ultraviolet radiation---ultraviolet_radiation%1:19:00:: and combines a microscope---microscope%1:06:00:: with a color - TV system---television_system%1:06:00:: to view the results---result%1:19:00:: .
Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 1 is a simplified block diagram---block_diagram%1:06:00:: of the ultraviolet microscopy---microscopy%1:04:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: developed at the Medical Electronics Center---group%1:03:00:: of Rockefeller Institute---group%1:03:00:: .
By combining the talents---talent%1:09:00:: of a medical man---medical_man%1:18:00:: , Dr. Aterman---person%1:03:00:: , a biophysicist---biophysicist%1:18:00:: , Mr. Berkely---person%1:03:00:: , and an electronics---electronics%1:09:00:: expert---expert%1:18:00:: , Dr. Zworykin---person%1:03:00:: , this novel technique---technique%1:09:00:: has been developed which promises to open broad avenues---avenue%1:04:00:: to understanding life---life%1:19:00:: processes .
Three different wavelengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: of ultraviolet radiation---ultraviolet_radiation%1:19:00:: are selected by the variable filters---filter%1:06:01:: placed in front of the three mercury---mercury%1:27:00:: xenon---xenon%1:27:00:: lights---light%1:06:00:: which serve as the ultraviolet---ultraviolet%1:19:00:: sources---source%1:15:00:: .
These wavelengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: are reflected in sequence---sequence%1:04:00:: through the specimen---specimen%1:08:00:: by the rotating mirror---mirror%1:06:00:: ; the specimen---specimen%1:08:00:: is magnified by the microscope---microscope%1:06:00:: .
Instead of the observer---observer%1:18:00:: 's eye---eye%1:08:00:: the image orthicon---image_orthicon%1:06:00:: in the TV camera---television_camera%1:06:00:: does the `` looking---looking%1:04:01:: '' .
The microscope---microscope%1:06:00:: and orthicon---orthicon%1:06:00:: are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum---ultraviolet_spectrum%1:19:00:: , which means that all lenses---lens%1:06:00:: must be quartz---quartz%1:27:01:: .
The video---video%1:10:00:: signal---signal%1:10:00:: is amplified and then switched , in synchronism---synchronism%1:24:00:: with the three ultraviolet light---ultraviolet_light%1:19:00:: sources---source%1:15:00:: which are sequenced by the rotating mirror---mirror%1:06:00:: so that during one-twentieth of a second---second%1:28:00:: only one wavelength---wavelength%1:07:00:: , corresponding to red---red%1:07:00:: , green , or blue , is seen .
Because of light---light%1:19:00:: leakage---leakage%1:11:00:: from one ultraviolet---ultraviolet%1:19:00:: source---source%1:15:00:: to another , the lights---light%1:06:00:: are switched by a commutator---commutator%1:06:00:: like assembly---assembly%1:06:00:: rotated by a synchronous motor---synchronous_motor%1:06:00:: .
This assembly---assembly%1:06:00:: also supplies a 20 - cps---cps%1:28:00:: switching---switching%1:04:00:: gate---gate%1:06:01:: for the electronics---electronics%1:09:00:: circuitry---circuitry%1:06:00:: . )
This is the same system---system%1:06:00:: as was used in the field---field%1:19:00:: sequential color TV---color_tv%1:06:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: which preceded the present simultaneous system---system%1:06:00:: .
Three separate amplifiers---amplifier%1:06:00:: then drive a 21 - inch---inch%1:23:00:: tricolor tube---tube%1:06:02:: .
The result---result%1:19:00:: is a color picture---picture%1:10:01:: of the specimen---specimen%1:08:00:: where the primary colors---color%1:07:00:: correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: .
Many of the cells---cell%1:03:00:: and microorganisms---microorganism%1:05:00:: which are transparent to visible light---visible_light%1:19:00:: , absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: of the ultraviolet spectrum---ultraviolet_spectrum%1:19:00:: .
Different parts---part%1:24:00:: of these cells---cell%1:03:00:: sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: so that it is often possible to see internal portions---portion%1:24:00:: of cells---cell%1:03:00:: in a different color---color%1:07:00:: .
Where the microscope---microscope%1:06:00:: under visible light---visible_light%1:19:00:: may show only vague shadows---shadow%1:26:01:: or nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: at all , ultraviolet illumination---ultraviolet_illumination%1:19:00:: and subsequent translation---translation%1:04:02:: into a color TV---tv%1:10:00:: picture---picture%1:10:01:: reveal a wealth---wealth%1:07:00:: of detail---detail%1:10:00:: .
At the present time---time%1:28:00:: the research---research%1:04:00:: team---team%1:14:00:: which pioneered this new technique---technique%1:09:00:: is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it .
The medical title---title%1:10:00:: of `` Lobar Ventilation in Man '' by Drs. C. J. Martin---person%1:03:00:: and A. C. Young---person%1:03:00:: , covers a brief paper---paper%1:10:02:: which is one part---part%1:24:00:: of a much larger effort---effort%1:04:00:: to apply electronics---electronics%1:09:00:: to the study---study%1:04:00:: of the respiratory process .
At the University of Washington Medical School---group%1:03:00:: , the electronics---electronics%1:09:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: has developed the `` Respiratory Gas Analyzer '' shown in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 3 .
This unit , affectionately dubbed `` The Monster '' , can be wheeled to any convenient location---location%1:03:00:: and provides a wealth---wealth%1:07:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: about the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's breathing---breathing%1:04:00:: .
In the lower center rack---rack%1:06:01:: an 8 - channel---channel%1:10:00:: recorder---recorder%1:06:01:: indicates the percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of carbon dioxide---carbon_dioxide%1:27:00:: and nitrogen---nitrogen%1:27:00:: from the upper and lower lobes---lobe%1:08:00:: of one lung---lung%1:08:00:: , the total volume---volume%1:23:00:: of inhalation---inhalation%1:04:00:: per breath---breath%1:04:00:: , the flow---flow%1:11:00:: of air---air%1:27:00:: from both lobes---lobe%1:08:00:: , and the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: of the two lobes---lobe%1:08:00:: with respect to each other .
Usually the patient---patient%1:18:00:: breathes into a mouthpiece---mouthpiece%1:06:04:: while walking a treadmill---treadmill%1:06:01:: , standing still , or in some other medically significant position---position%1:07:01:: .
From the resulting data---data%1:14:00:: the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: can determine lung---lung%1:08:00:: defects---defect%1:26:01:: with hitherto unknown accuracy---accuracy%1:07:02:: and detail---detail%1:10:00:: .
The original electrocardiograph---electrocardiograph%1:06:00:: primarily indicates irregularities---irregularity%1:07:00:: in the heartbeat---heartbeat%1:11:00:: , but today---today%1:28:00:: 's techniques---technique%1:09:00:: allow exact measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: of the flow---flow%1:28:00:: of blood---blood%1:08:00:: through the aorta---aorta%1:08:00:: , dimensioning of the heart---heart%1:08:00:: and its chambers---chamber%1:08:00:: , and a much more detailed study---study%1:04:00:: of each heartbeat---heartbeat%1:11:00:: .
For many of these measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: the chest---chest%1:08:00:: must be opened , but the blood vessels---blood_vessel%1:08:00:: and the heart---heart%1:08:00:: itself remain undisturbed .
A group---group%1:03:00:: of researchers---researcher%1:18:00:: at the University of Washington---group%1:03:00:: have given a paper---paper%1:10:02:: which briefly outlines some of these techniques---technique%1:09:00:: .
One simple method---method%1:09:00:: of measuring the expansion---expansion%1:04:00:: of the heart---heart%1:08:00:: is to tie a thin rubber---rubber%1:27:00:: tube---tube%1:06:00:: , filled with mercury---mercury%1:27:00:: , around the heart---heart%1:08:00:: and record the change---change%1:24:00:: in resistance---resistance%1:19:00:: as the tube---tube%1:06:00:: is stretched .
A balanced resistance---resistance%1:19:00:: bridge---bridge%1:06:05:: and a pen---pen%1:06:00:: recorder---recorder%1:06:01:: are all the electronic instrumentation---instrumentation%1:06:00:: needed .
Sonar---sonar%1:06:00:: can be used to measure the thickness---thickness%1:07:01:: of the heart---heart%1:08:00:: by placing small crystal---crystal%1:06:02:: transducers---transducer%1:06:00:: at opposite sides---side%1:15:02:: of the heart---heart%1:08:00:: or blood vessel---blood_vessel%1:08:00:: and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy---energy%1:19:00:: .
The travel---travel%1:04:00:: time of sound---sound%1:19:00:: in tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: is about 1500 meters---meter%1:23:00:: per second---second%1:28:00:: thus it takes about 16 | msec. to traverse 25 mm.---mm%1:23:00:: of tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: .
A sonar---sonar%1:06:00:: or radar---radar%1:06:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: of pulse generator---pulse_generator%1:06:00:: and time-delay measuring system---time-delay_measuring_system%1:06:00:: is required for body---body%1:08:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: evaluation---evaluation%1:04:00:: .
In addition to the heart---heart%1:08:00:: and aorta---aorta%1:08:00:: , successful measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: of liver---liver%1:08:00:: and spleen---spleen%1:08:00:: have also been made by this technique---technique%1:09:00:: .
The Doppler effect---doppler_effect%1:19:00:: , using ultrasonic signals---signal%1:10:00:: , can be employed to measure the flow---flow%1:28:00:: of blood---blood%1:08:00:: without cutting into the blood vessel---blood_vessel%1:08:00:: .
A still more sophisticated system---system%1:06:00:: has been devised for determining the effective power---power%1:07:02:: of the heart---heart%1:08:00:: itself .
It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement---arrangement%1:14:00:: of the heart---heart%1:08:00:: and a catheter---catheter%1:06:00:: carrying a thermistor---thermistor%1:06:00:: inserted into the bloodstream---bloodstream%1:08:00:: .
The latter measures the heat---heat%1:19:00:: carried away by the bloodstream---bloodstream%1:08:00:: as an indication---indication%1:10:00:: of the velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: of the blood---blood%1:08:00:: flow---flow%1:28:00:: .
It is also possible to utilize a pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: transducer---transducer%1:06:00:: , mounted at the end---end%1:15:00:: of a catheter---catheter%1:06:00:: which is inserted into the heart---heart%1:08:00:: 's left ventricle---left_ventricle%1:08:00:: , to indicate the blood pressure---blood_pressure%1:19:00:: in the heart---heart%1:08:00:: itself .
This pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: measurement---measurement%1:04:00:: may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement---measurement%1:04:00:: is made .
A simplified version---version%1:09:01:: of the instrumentation---instrumentation%1:06:00:: for this procedure---procedure%1:04:02:: is shown in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 2 .
Outputs---output%1:10:02:: of the two systems---system%1:06:00:: are measured by a pulse timing circuit---pulse_timing_circuit%1:06:00:: and a resistance---resistance%1:19:00:: bridge---bridge%1:06:05:: , followed by a simple analogue computer---analogue_computer%1:06:00:: which feeds a multichannel recorder---multichannel_recorder%1:06:00:: .
From this doctors---doctor%1:18:00:: can read heart rate---heart_rate%1:28:00:: , change---change%1:24:00:: in diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: , pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: , and effective heart---heart%1:08:00:: power---power%1:07:02:: .
Several years---year%1:28:01:: ago headlines---headline%1:10:00:: were made by a small radio transmitter---radio_transmitter%1:06:00:: capsule---capsule%1:06:02:: which could be swallowed by the patient---patient%1:18:00:: and which would then radio internal pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: to external receivers---receiver%1:06:00:: .
This original capsule---capsule%1:06:02:: contained a battery---battery%1:06:00:: and a transistor---transistor%1:06:00:: oscillator---oscillator%1:06:00:: and was about 1 cm.---cm%1:23:00:: in diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: .
Battery---battery%1:06:00:: life---life%1:28:00:: limited the use---use%1:04:00:: of this `` pill---pill%1:06:01:: '' to about 8 to 30 hours---hour%1:28:00:: maximum .
A refinement---refinement%1:11:00:: of this technique---technique%1:09:00:: has been described by Drs. Zworykin---person%1:03:00:: and Farrar---person%1:03:00:: and Mr. Berkely---person%1:03:00:: of the Medical Electronics Center---group%1:03:00:: of the Rockefeller Institute---group%1:03:00:: .
In this novel arrangement the `` pill---pill%1:06:01:: '' is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit---circuit%1:06:00:: in which the capacitor---capacitor%1:06:00:: is formed by a pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: sensing transducer---transducer%1:06:00:: .
As shown in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 4 , an external antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: is placed over or around the patient---patient%1:18:00:: and excited 3000 times---time%1:11:00:: a second---second%1:28:00:: with short 400 - kc.---kc%1:28:00:: bursts---burst%1:04:00:: .
The energy---energy%1:19:00:: received by the `` pill---pill%1:06:01:: '' causes the resonant circuit---circuit%1:06:00:: to `` ring '' on after the burst---burst%1:04:00:: and this `` ringing '' takes place at the resonant frequency---frequency%1:28:00:: of the `` pill---pill%1:06:01:: '' .
These frequencies---frequency%1:28:00:: are amplified and detected by the FM---fm%1:10:00:: receiver---receiver%1:06:00:: after each burst---burst%1:04:00:: of transmitted energy---energy%1:19:00:: and , after the `` pill---pill%1:06:01:: '' has been calibrated , precise internal pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: indications---indication%1:10:00:: can be obtained .
One of the advantages---advantage%1:07:00:: of this method---method%1:09:00:: is that the `` pill---pill%1:06:01:: '' can remain in the patient---patient%1:18:00:: for several days---day%1:28:00:: , permitting observation---observation%1:04:01:: under natural conditions---condition%1:26:00:: .
Applications---application%1:04:02:: to organs---organ%1:08:00:: other than the gastrointestinal tract---tract%1:08:01:: are planned for future experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: .
One of the most gratifying applications---application%1:04:02:: of an important technique---technique%1:09:00:: of submarine---submarine%1:06:00:: detection---detection%1:04:00:: is in the exploration---exploration%1:04:02:: of the human body---human_body%1:08:00:: .
Our readers---reader%1:18:02:: are familiar with the principles---principle%1:09:02:: of sonar---sonar%1:06:00:: where sound waves---sound_wave%1:11:00:: are sent out in water---water%1:17:00:: and the echoes---echo%1:07:00:: then indicate submerged objects---object%1:03:00:: .
Various methods---method%1:09:00:: of pulsing , scanning , and displaying these sound waves---sound_wave%1:11:00:: are used to detect submarines---submarine%1:06:00:: , map ocean floors---ocean_floor%1:17:00:: , and even communicate under water---water%1:17:00:: .
In medicine---medicine%1:09:00:: the frequencies---frequency%1:28:00:: are much higher , transducers---transducer%1:06:00:: and the sonar---sonar%1:06:00:: beams---beam%1:19:01:: themselves are much smaller , and different scanning techniques---technique%1:09:00:: may be used , but the principles---principle%1:09:04:: involved are the same as in sonar---sonar%1:06:00:: .
Because the body---body%1:08:00:: contains so much liquid---liquid%1:27:00:: , transmission---transmission%1:10:00:: of ultrasonic signals---signal%1:10:00:: proceeds fairly well in muscles---muscle%1:08:01:: and blood vessels---blood_vessel%1:08:00:: .
Bones---bone%1:08:00:: and cartilage---cartilage%1:08:00:: transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals---signal%1:10:00:: .
Based on this phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: , a number---number%1:07:00:: of investigators---investigator%1:18:01:: have used this method---method%1:09:00:: to `` look through '' human organs---organ%1:08:00:: .
A good example---good_example%1:09:00:: of the results---result%1:19:00:: obtainable with ultrasonic radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: is contained in papers---paper%1:10:02:: presented by Dr. G. Baum---person%1:03:00:: who has explored the human eye---eye%1:08:00:: .
He can diagnose detachment---detachment%1:04:00:: of the retina---retina%1:08:00:: where conventional methods---method%1:09:00:: indicate blindness---blindness%1:26:00:: due to glaucoma---glaucoma%1:26:00:: .
The method---method%1:09:00:: used to scan the eye---eye%1:08:00:: ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 6 .
The transducer---transducer%1:06:00:: is coupled to the body---body%1:08:00:: through a water---water%1:27:00:: bath---bath%1:06:02:: , not shown .
For display---display%1:10:01:: , Dr. Baum---person%1:03:00:: uses a portion---portion%1:06:00:: of an * * f , an airborne radar---radar%1:06:00:: indicator---indicator%1:06:00:: , and then photographs the screen---screen%1:06:05:: to obtain a permanent record---record%1:10:03:: .
A typical `` sonogram---sonogram%1:06:00:: '' of a human eye---eye%1:08:00:: , together with a description---description%1:10:01:: of the anatomical parts---part%1:17:00:: , is shown in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 5 .
The frequency---frequency%1:28:00:: used for these experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: is 15 mc.---mc%1:28:00:: and the transducer---transducer%1:06:00:: is a specially cut crystal---crystal%1:06:02:: with an epoxy---epoxy%1:27:00:: lens---lens%1:06:00:: capable of providing beam---beam%1:19:01:: diameters---diameter%1:07:00:: smaller than one millimeter---millimeter%1:23:00:: .
The transducer---transducer%1:06:00:: itself moves the beam---beam%1:19:01:: in a sector---sector%1:25:00:: scan---scan%1:04:00:: , just like a radar---radar%1:06:00:: antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: , while the entire transducer---transducer%1:06:00:: structure---structure%1:06:00:: is moved over a 90 - degree---degree%1:23:00:: arc---arc%1:25:00:: in front of the eye---eye%1:08:00:: to `` look into '' all corners---corner%1:15:01:: .
The total picture---picture%1:10:01:: is only seen by the camera---camera%1:06:01:: which integrates the many sector---sector%1:25:00:: scans---scan%1:04:00:: over the entire 90 - degree---degree%1:23:00:: rotation---rotation%1:04:00:: period---period%1:28:02:: .
Drs. Howry---person%1:03:00:: and Holmes---person%1:03:00:: at the University of Colorado Medical School---group%1:03:00:: have applied the same sonar---sonar%1:06:00:: technique---technique%1:09:00:: to other areas---area%1:08:00:: of soft tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: and have obtained extremely good results---result%1:19:00:: .
By submerging the patient---patient%1:18:00:: in a tub---tub%1:06:01:: and rotating the transducer---transducer%1:06:00:: while the scanning goes on , they have been able to get cross-section views---view%1:06:00:: of the neck---neck%1:08:00:: , as shown in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 7 , as well as many other hitherto impossible insights---insight%1:09:01:: .
As mentioned before , bone---bone%1:27:00:: reflects the sound---sound%1:19:00:: energy---energy%1:19:00:: and in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 7 the portion---portion%1:24:00:: of the spine---spine%1:08:00:: shows as the black area---area%1:08:00:: in the center---center%1:15:01:: .
Arteries---artery%1:08:00:: and veins---vein%1:08:00:: are apparent by their black , blood-filled centers---center%1:15:01:: and the surrounding white walls---wall%1:08:00:: .
A cross-section---cross_section%1:15:00:: of a normal lower human leg---leg%1:08:01:: is shown in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 8 with the various parts---part%1:17:00:: labeled .
I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions---assumption%1:09:00:: are self-evident , in the sense that everyone agrees with them .
If they were , Walter Lippmann---person%1:03:00:: would be writing the same columns---column%1:10:00:: as George Sokolsky---person%1:03:00:: , and Herblock---person%1:03:00:: would have nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to draw cartoons---cartoon%1:10:00:: about .
I do mean , however , that I take them for granted , and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions---assumption%1:09:00:: .
The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity---prosperity%1:26:00:: ; and in particular - since this is our special responsibility - that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States .
The ultimate objective---objective%1:09:00:: of American policy---policy%1:10:00:: is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure---measure%1:03:00:: of freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: and justice---justice%1:04:00:: and peace---peace%1:26:00:: and material prosperity---prosperity%1:26:02:: ; and in particular - since this is our special responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: - that these conditions---condition%1:26:00:: be enjoyed by the people---people%1:14:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
I speak of `` the largest possible measure---measure%1:03:00:: '' because any person---person%1:03:00:: who supposes that these conditions---condition%1:26:00:: can be universally and perfectly achieved - ever - reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: , and is therefore a dangerous man---man%1:18:04:: to have around .
These conditions---condition%1:26:00:: are unobtainable - are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated - without the prior defeat---defeat%1:11:00:: of world Communism---communism%1:14:00:: .
This is true for two reasons---reason%1:10:01:: : because Communism---communism%1:14:00:: is both doctrinally , and in practice , antithetical to these conditions---condition%1:26:00:: ; and because Communists---communist%1:18:01:: have the will---will%1:09:01:: and , as long as Soviet power---power%1:07:00:: remains intact , the capacity---capacity%1:26:00:: to prevent their realization---realization%1:04:00:: .
Moreover , as Communist power---power%1:07:00:: increases---increase%1:22:00:: , the enjoyment---enjoyment%1:07:00:: of these conditions---condition%1:26:00:: throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: of their restoration---restoration%1:04:01:: becomes increasingly remote .
It follows that victory---victory%1:11:00:: over Communism---communism%1:14:00:: is the dominant , proximate goal---goal%1:09:00:: of American policy---policy%1:10:00:: .
Proximate in the sense---sense%1:10:00:: that there are more distant , more `` positive '' ends---end%1:09:02:: we seek , to which victory---victory%1:11:00:: over Communism---communism%1:14:00:: is but a means---means%1:04:00:: .
But dominant in the sense---sense%1:10:00:: that every other objective---objective%1:09:00:: , no matter how worthy intrinsically , must defer to it .
Peace---peace%1:26:00:: is a worthy objective---objective%1:09:00:: ; but if we must choose between peace---peace%1:26:00:: and keeping the Communists---communist%1:18:01:: out of Berlin---berlin%1:15:00:: , then we must fight .
Freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: , in the sense---sense%1:10:00:: of self-determination---self-determination%1:26:00:: , is a worthy objective---objective%1:09:00:: ; but if granting self-determination---self-determination%1:26:00:: to the Algerian rebels---person%1:03:00:: entails sweeping that area---area%1:15:01:: into the Sino-Soviet---location%1:03:00:: orbit---orbit%1:07:00:: , then Algerian freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: must be postponed .
Justice---justice%1:04:00:: is a worthy objective---objective%1:09:00:: ; but if justice---justice%1:04:00:: for Bantus entails driving the government---government%1:14:00:: of the Union of South Africa---south_africa%1:15:00:: away from the West---west%1:15:00:: , then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification---identification%1:10:01:: cards---card%1:10:01:: yet a while longer .
Prosperity---prosperity%1:26:02:: is a worthy objective---objective%1:09:00:: ; but if providing higher standards of living---standard_of_living%1:26:00:: gets in the way---way%1:04:00:: of producing sufficient guns---gun%1:06:00:: to resist Communist aggression---aggression%1:07:00:: , then material sacrifices---sacrifice%1:04:01:: and denials---denial%1:04:01:: will have to be made .
It may be , of course , that such objectives---objective%1:09:00:: can be pursued consisently with a policy---policy%1:10:00:: designed to overthrow Communism---communism%1:14:00:: ; my point---point%1:10:01:: is that where conflicts---conflict%1:04:00:: arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition---condition%1:26:00:: for a tolerant world - the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of Soviet Communist power---power%1:07:00:: .
This much having been said , the question remains whether we have the resources---resource%1:21:00:: for the job we have to do - defeat Communism - and , if so , how those resources---resource%1:21:00:: ought to be used .
This much---much%1:23:00:: having been said , the question---question%1:10:01:: remains whether we have the resources---resource%1:07:00:: for the job---job%1:04:01:: we have to do - defeat Communism---communism%1:14:00:: - and , if so , how those resources---resource%1:07:00:: ought to be used .
This brings us squarely to the problem---problem%1:09:00:: of power---power%1:07:00:: , and the uses---use%1:07:02:: a nation---nation%1:14:00:: makes of power---power%1:07:00:: .
I submit that this is the key problem---problem%1:09:00:: of international relations---relations%1:24:00:: , that it always has been , that it always will be .
And I suggest further that the main cause---cause%1:11:00:: of the trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: we are in has been the failure---failure%1:11:00:: of American policy-makers---policy_maker%1:18:00:: , ever since we assumed free world---free_world%1:14:00:: leadership---leadership%1:26:00:: in 1945 , to deal with this problem---problem%1:09:00:: realistically and seriously .
In the recent political campaign---political_campaign%1:11:00:: two charges---charge%1:10:00:: were leveled affecting the question---question%1:10:01:: of power---power%1:07:00:: , and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus---focus%1:07:03:: .
The first was that America---america%1:15:00:: had become - or was in danger of becoming - a second-rate military power---power%1:14:00:: .
I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity---absurdity%1:10:00:: of that contention---contention%1:10:02:: .
You may have misgivings---misgiving%1:12:00:: about certain aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of our military establishment---establishment%1:14:02:: - I certainly do - but you know any comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: of over-all American strength---strength%1:07:05:: with over-all Soviet strength---strength%1:07:05:: finds the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons---weapon%1:06:00:: and in the development---development%1:22:02:: of new ones that our advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: promises to be a permanent feature---feature%1:09:00:: of U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: - Soviet relations---relations%1:24:00:: for the foreseeable future---future%1:28:00:: .
You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment---establishment%1:14:00:: - I certainly do - but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States not only superior , but so superior both in present weapons and in the development---development%1:04:01:: of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U. S. - Soviet relations for the foreseeable future .
I have often searched for a graphic way---way%1:04:01:: of impressing our superiority---superiority%1:07:00:: on those Americans who have doubts---doubt%1:09:00:: , and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne---person%1:03:00:: has done it well in his new book---book%1:10:00:: American Might and Soviet Myth .
Suppose , he says , that the tables were turned , and we were in the Soviets---soviets%1:14:00:: ' position---position%1:26:02:: : `` There would be more than 2000 modern Soviet fighters---fighter%1:06:00:: , all better than ours , stationed at 250 bases---base%1:06:04:: in Mexico---mexico%1:15:00:: and the Caribbean---caribbean%1:17:00:: .
Overwhelming Russian naval power---power%1:07:00:: would always be within a few hundred miles---mile%1:23:01:: of our coast---coast%1:17:00:: .
Half---half%1:23:00:: of the population---population%1:14:00:: of the U. S.---u.s.%1:15:00:: would be needed to work on arms---arms%1:06:00:: just to feed the people---people%1:14:00:: '' .
Add this to the unrest---unrest%1:26:00:: in the countries---country%1:14:00:: around us where oppressed peoples---people%1:14:00:: would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: .
Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant---plant%1:06:01:: which would severely limit our capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: to keep abreast of the Soviets---soviets%1:14:00:: even in the missile---missile%1:06:01:: field---field%1:15:03:: which is reputed to be our main strength---strength%1:07:05:: .
If we look at the situation---situation%1:26:00:: this way---way%1:07:01:: , we can get an idea---idea%1:09:00:: of Khrushchev---person%1:03:00:: 's nightmarish worries---worry%1:09:00:: - or , at least , of the worries---worry%1:09:00:: he might have if his enemies---enemy%1:14:00:: were disposed to exploit their advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: .
The other charge---charge%1:10:00:: was that America---america%1:15:00:: 's political position---position%1:26:00:: in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years---years%1:28:01:: .
The contention---contention%1:10:02:: needs to be formulated with much greater precision---precision%1:07:00:: than it ever was during the campaign---campaign%1:11:00:: , but once that has been done , I fail to see how any serious student---student%1:18:01:: of world affairs---world_affairs%1:04:00:: can quarrel with it .
The argument---argument%1:10:00:: was typically advanced in terms of U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: `` prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: '' .
Prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: , however , is only a minor part---part%1:24:00:: of the problem---problem%1:09:00:: ; and even then , it is a concept---concept%1:09:00:: that can be highly misleading .
Prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: is a measure---measure%1:10:03:: of how other people---people%1:14:00:: think of you , well or ill .
But contrary---contrary%1:24:01:: to what was implied during the campaign---campaign%1:11:00:: , prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: is surely not important for its own sake---sake%1:07:00:: .
Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: simply because foreign peoples---people%1:14:00:: are not as impressed by our strength---strength%1:07:05:: as they ought to be .
The thing---thing%1:26:00:: to lose sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: over is what people---people%1:14:00:: , having concluded that we are weaker than we are , are likely to do about it .
The evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: suggests that foreign peoples---people%1:14:01:: believe the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: is weaker than the Soviet Union---soviet_union%1:15:00:: , and is bound to fall still further behind in the years---year%1:28:01:: ahead .
This ignorant estimate , I repeat , is not of any interest---interest%1:09:00:: in itself ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do - namely , by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side .
This ignorant estimate---estimate%1:04:01:: , I repeat , is not of any interest---interest%1:07:02:: in itself ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples---people%1:14:01:: react the way---way%1:07:01:: human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: typically do - namely , by taking steps---step%1:04:02:: to end up on what appears to be the winning side---side%1:14:00:: .
To the extent---extent%1:26:00:: , then , that declining U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: means that other nations---nation%1:14:00:: will be tempted to place their bets---bet%1:21:00:: on an ultimate American defeat---defeat%1:11:00:: , and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation---intimidation%1:04:01:: , there is reason---reason%1:16:00:: for concern---concern%1:12:01:: .
Still , these guesses---guess%1:10:00:: about the outcome---outcome%1:11:00:: of the struggle---struggle%1:04:02:: cannot be as important as the actual power---power%1:07:00:: relationship---relationship%1:26:01:: between the Soviet Union---soviet_union%1:15:00:: and ourselves .
Here I do not speak of military power---power%1:07:00:: where our advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: is obvious and overwhelming but of political power---power%1:07:00:: - of influence---influence%1:07:00:: , if you will - about which the relevant questions---question%1:10:01:: are :
Is Soviet influence---influence%1:07:00:: throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years---year%1:28:01:: ago ?
And is Western influence---influence%1:07:00:: greater or less than it used to be ?
In answering these questions---question%1:10:00:: , we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops---troops%1:14:00:: have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before , and not merely whether disciplined agents---agent%1:18:02:: of the Cominform are in control---control%1:07:00:: of governments---government%1:14:00:: from which they were formerly excluded :
the success---success%1:04:00:: of Communism---communism%1:14:00:: 's war---war%1:04:02:: against the West---west%1:15:00:: does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests---conquest%1:04:01:: .
Success---success%1:04:00:: may mean merely the displacement---displacement%1:04:00:: of Western influence---influence%1:07:00:: .
Communist political warfare---warfare%1:04:02:: , we must remember , is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages---stage%1:28:00:: .
Fearful of inviting a military showdown---showdown%1:10:00:: with the West---west%1:15:00:: which they could not win , the Communists---communist%1:18:01:: seek to undermine Western power---power%1:07:00:: where the nuclear might---might%1:07:00:: of the West---west%1:15:00:: is irrelevant - in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes---skirmish%1:04:00:: , in mob uprisings---uprising%1:04:00:: in the streets---street%1:26:00:: , in parliaments---parliament%1:14:00:: , in clandestine meetings---meeting%1:04:00:: of undercover conspirators---conspirator%1:18:00:: , at the United Nations---united_nations%1:14:00:: , on the propaganda---propaganda%1:10:00:: front---front%1:15:01:: , at diplomatic conferences---conference%1:14:00:: - preferably at the highest level---level%1:26:01:: .
The Soviets---soviets%1:14:00:: understand , moreover , that the first step---first_step%1:04:00:: in turning a country---country%1:14:00:: toward Communism---communism%1:14:00:: is to turn it against the West---west%1:15:00:: .
Thus , typically , the first stage---stage%1:28:00:: of a Communist takeover---takeover%1:04:02:: is to `` neutralize '' a country---country%1:14:00:: .
The second stage---stage%1:28:00:: is to retain the nominal classification---classification%1:14:00:: of `` neutralist---neutralist%1:18:00:: '' , while in fact turning the country---country%1:14:00:: into an active advocate---advocate%1:18:00:: and adherent---adherent%1:18:00:: of Soviet policy---policy%1:10:00:: .
And this may be as far as the process---process%1:04:00:: will go .
The Kremlin---group%1:03:00:: 's goal---goal%1:09:00:: is the isolation---isolation%1:04:00:: and capture---capture%1:04:00:: , not of Ghana---ghana%1:15:00:: , but of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: - and this purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: may be served very well by countries---country%1:14:00:: that masquerade under a `` neutralist---neutralist%1:18:00:: '' mask---mask%1:04:00:: , yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries---auxiliary%1:18:00:: of the Soviet Foreign Office---foreign_office%1:14:00:: .
To recite the particulars---particular%1:09:00:: of recent Soviet successes---success%1:04:00:: is hardly reassuring .
Six years---year%1:28:01:: ago French Indochina---location%1:03:00:: , though in troubie , was in the Western camp---camp%1:14:01:: .
Today---today%1:28:00:: Northern Vietnam---location%1:03:00:: is overtly Communist ; Laos---laos%1:15:00:: is teetering between Communism---communism%1:14:00:: and pro Communist neutralism---neutralism%1:10:00:: ; Cambodia---cambodia%1:15:00:: is , for all practical purposes , neutralist---neutralist%1:18:00:: .
Indonesia---indonesia%1:15:00:: , in the early days---early_days%1:28:00:: of the Republic---republic%1:14:00:: , leaned toward the West---west%1:15:00:: .
Today---today%1:28:00:: Sukarno---person%1:03:00:: 's government---government%1:14:00:: is heavily besieged by avowed Communists---communist%1:18:01:: , and for all of its `` neutralist---neutralist%1:18:00:: '' pretensions---pretension%1:07:00:: , it is a firm ally---ally%1:14:00:: of Soviet policy---policy%1:10:00:: .
Ceylon---ceylon%1:15:00:: has moved from a pro Western orientation---orientation%1:09:00:: to a neutralism---neutralism%1:10:00:: openly hostile to the West---west%1:15:00:: .
In the Middle East---middle_east%1:15:00:: , Iraq---iraq%1:15:00:: , Syria---syria%1:15:00:: and Egypt---egypt%1:15:00:: were , a short while---while%1:28:00:: ago , in the Western camp---camp%1:14:01:: .
Today---today%1:28:00:: the Nasser---group%1:03:00:: and Kassem---group%1:03:00:: governments---government%1:14:00:: are adamantly hostile to the West---west%1:15:00:: , are dependent for their military power---power%1:07:00:: on Soviet equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: and personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: ; in almost every particular---particular%1:09:00:: follow the Kremlin---group%1:03:00:: 's foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: line---line%1:09:01:: .
A short time---time%1:28:00:: ago all Africa---africa%1:17:00:: was a Western preserve---preserve%1:26:00:: .
Never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination---self-determination%1:26:00:: : the point---point%1:10:01:: is that in the struggle---struggle%1:04:02:: for the world that vast land mass---landmass%1:17:00:: was under the domination---domination%1:04:00:: and influence---influence%1:07:00:: of the West---west%1:15:00:: .
Today---today%1:28:00:: , Africa---africa%1:17:00:: is swerving violently away from the West---west%1:15:00:: and plunging , it would seem , into the Soviet orbit---orbit%1:26:00:: .
Latin America---latin_america%1:15:00:: was once an area---area%1:15:01:: as `` safe '' for the West---west%1:15:00:: as Nebraska---nebraska%1:15:00:: was for Nixon---person%1:03:00:: .
Today---today%1:28:00:: it is up for grabs .
One Latin American country---country%1:14:00:: , Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: , has become a Soviet bridgehead---bridgehead%1:15:00:: ninety miles---mile%1:23:01:: off our coast---coast%1:17:00:: .
In some countries---country%1:14:00:: the trend---trend%1:15:02:: has gone further than others :
Mexico---mexico%1:15:00:: , Panama---panama%1:15:00:: , and Venezuela---venezuela%1:15:00:: are displaying open sympathy---sympathy%1:12:00:: for Castroism , and there is no country---country%1:14:00:: - save the Dominican Republic---dominican_republic%1:15:00:: whose funeral---funeral%1:11:00:: services---service%1:04:01:: we recently arranged - where Castroism and anti Americanism---americanism%1:07:00:: does not prevent the government---government%1:14:00:: from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause---cause%1:04:01:: .
Only in Europe---europe%1:17:00:: have our lines---line%1:14:03:: remained firm - and there only on the surface---surface%1:09:00:: .
The strains---strain%1:10:00:: of neutralism---neutralism%1:10:00:: are running strong , notably in England---england%1:15:00:: , and even in Germany---germany%1:15:00:: .
What have we to show by way of counter successes---success%1:04:00:: ?
We have had opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: - clear invitations---invitation%1:10:00:: to plant our influence---influence%1:07:00:: on the other side---side%1:15:02:: of the Iron Curtain---iron_curtain%1:09:00:: .
There was the Hungarian Revolution---revolution%1:04:00:: which we praised and mourned , but did nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: about .
There was the Polish Revolution---revolution%1:04:00:: which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course---course%1:14:00:: favorable to Soviet interests---interest%1:07:01:: .
There was the revolution---revolution%1:04:00:: in Tibet---tibet%1:15:00:: which we pretended did not exist .
Only in one instance---instance%1:11:00:: have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power---power%1:07:00:: :
in Guatemala---guatemala%1:15:00:: .
And contrary to what has been said recently , we did not wait for `` outside pressures---pressure%1:07:00:: '' and `` world---world%1:14:02:: opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: '' to bring down that Communist government---government%1:14:00:: ; we moved decisively to effect an anti Communist coup d ' etat---coup%1:04:00:: .
We served our national interests---interest%1:07:01:: , and by so doing we saved the Guatemalan people---people%1:14:01:: the ultimate in human misery---misery%1:26:00:: .
The plant---plant%1:06:01:: was located west of the Battenkill---location%1:03:00:: and south of the location---location%1:03:00:: of the former electric light---electric_light%1:06:00:: plant---plant%1:06:01:: .
The Manchester Depot Sewer Company---group%1:03:00:: issued 214 shares---share%1:21:01:: of stock---stock%1:21:00:: at $ 10 each for construction---construction%1:04:00:: of a sewer---sewer%1:06:00:: in that locality---locality%1:15:00:: , and assessments---assessment%1:09:00:: were made for its maintenance---maintenance%1:04:00:: .
It has given considerable trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: at times and empties right into the Battenkill .
Fire District No. 1---location%1:03:00:: discussed its possible purchase---purchase%1:04:00:: in 1945 , but considered it an unwise investment---investment%1:04:00:: .
The sewer---sewer%1:06:00:: on Bonnet Street---location%1:03:00:: was constructed when there were only a few houses---house%1:06:00:: on the street---street%1:06:00:: .
as new homes---home%1:06:00:: were built they were connected so that all residences---residence%1:15:00:: south of School Street---location%1:03:00:: are served by it .
B. J. Connell---person%1:03:00:: is the present treasurer---treasurer%1:18:00:: and manager---manager%1:18:00:: .
The 1946 town meeting---town_meeting%1:14:00:: voted to have the Selectmen---selectman%1:18:00:: appoint a committee---committee%1:14:00:: to investigate and report on the feasibility---feasibility%1:07:00:: of some system---system%1:09:01:: of sewage disposal---sewage_disposal%1:04:00:: and a disposal plant---disposal_plant%1:06:00:: to serve Manchester Center---location%1:03:00:: , Depot---location%1:03:00:: , and Way 's Lane---location%1:03:00:: .
The committee---committee%1:14:00:: submitted a report---report%1:10:03:: signed by Louis Martin---person%1:03:00:: and Leon Wiley---person%1:03:00:: with a map---map%1:06:00:: published in the 1946 town---town%1:15:01:: report---report%1:10:03:: .
The layout---layout%1:04:00:: of the sewer lines---sewer_line%1:06:00:: was designed by Henry W. Taylor---person%1:03:00:: , who was the engineer---engineer%1:18:00:: for the Manchester Village---location%1:03:00:: disposal plant---disposal_plant%1:06:00:: .
No figures---figure%1:21:00:: were submitted with the report---report%1:10:03:: and no action---action%1:04:02:: was taken on it by the town---town%1:15:01:: .
The 1958 town meeting---town_meeting%1:14:00:: directed town---town%1:15:01:: authorities---authority%1:18:01:: to seek federal and state---state%1:15:01:: funds---funds%1:21:00:: with which to conduct a preliminary survey---survey%1:04:02:: of a proposed sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: plant---plant%1:06:01:: with its attendant facilities---facility%1:06:00:: .
The final step---step%1:04:02:: was a vote---vote%1:04:01:: for a $ 230000 bond---bond%1:21:02:: issue---issue%1:04:01:: for the construction---construction%1:04:00:: of a sewage system---sewage_system%1:06:00:: by the 1959 town meeting---town_meeting%1:14:00:: , later confirmed by a two-thirds---two-thirds%1:23:00:: vote---vote%1:04:00:: at a special town meeting---town_meeting%1:14:00:: June 21---june_21%1:28:00:: , 1960 .
There the matter---matter%1:09:01:: stands with the prospect---prospect%1:26:00:: that soon Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: may be removed from the roster---roster%1:10:01:: of towns---town%1:15:00:: contributing raw sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: to its main streams---stream%1:17:00:: .
Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: 's unusual interest---interest%1:09:00:: in telegraphy---telegraphy%1:10:00:: has often been attributed to the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that the Rev. J. D. Wickham---person%1:03:00:: , headmaster---headmaster%1:18:00:: of Burr---group%1:03:00:: and Burton Seminary---group%1:03:00:: , was a personal friend---friend%1:18:00:: and correspondent---correspondent%1:18:00:: of the inventor---inventor%1:18:00:: , Samuel F. B. Morse---person%1:03:00:: .
At any rate , Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: did not lag far behind the first commercial system---system%1:06:00:: which was set up in 1844 between Baltimore---baltimore%1:15:00:: and Washington---washington%1:15:01:: .
In 1846 Matthew B. Goodwin---person%1:03:00:: , jeweler---jeweler%1:18:01:: and watchmaker---watchmaker%1:18:00:: , became the town---town%1:15:00:: 's first telegrapher---telegrapher%1:18:00:: in a dwelling---dwelling%1:06:00:: he built for himself and his business---business%1:14:00:: `` two doors---door%1:06:01:: north of the Equinox House---location%1:03:00:: '' or `` one door---door%1:06:01:: north of the Bank---group%1:03:00:: , Manchester---manchester%1:15:00:: , Vermont---vermont%1:15:00:: '' .
Goodwin---person%1:03:00:: was telegrapher---telegrapher%1:18:00:: for the `` American Telegraph Company---group%1:03:00:: '' and the `` Troy and Canada Junction Telegraph Company---group%1:03:00:: '' .
Shares---share%1:21:01:: of capital stock---capital_stock%1:21:00:: at $ 15 each in the latter company---company%1:14:01:: were payable at the Bank of Manchester---group%1:03:00:: or at various other Vermont---vermont%1:15:00:: banks---bank%1:14:00:: .
A message---message%1:10:01:: of less than fifteen words---word%1:10:00:: to Bennington---bennington%1:15:00:: cost twenty-five cents---cent%1:23:00:: .
By 1871 L. C. Orvis---person%1:03:00:: , manager---manager%1:18:00:: of the `` Western Union Telegraph Company---group%1:03:00:: '' , expressed willingness---willingness%1:07:00:: to send emergency---emergency%1:26:00:: telegrams---telegram%1:10:00:: on Sundays---sunday%1:28:00:: from his Village---village%1:14:00:: drugstore---drugstore%1:06:00:: .
Orvis---person%1:03:00:: even needed to hire an assistant---assistant%1:18:00:: , Clark J. Wait---person%1:03:00:: .
The Manchester Journal---group%1:03:00:: commented editorially on the surprising amount---amount%1:07:00:: of local telegraphic business---business%1:04:02:: .
In the fall---fall%1:28:00:: of 1878 , the `` Popular Telegraph Line---group%1:03:00:: '' was established between Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: and Factory Point---location%1:03:00:: by the owners---owner%1:18:00:: , Paul W. Orvis---person%1:03:00:: , Henry Gray---person%1:03:00:: , J. N. Hard---person%1:03:00:: , and Clark J. Wait---person%1:03:00:: .
The line---line%1:06:01:: soon lived up to its name---name%1:10:00:: , as local messages---message%1:10:01:: of moderate length---length%1:07:02:: could be sent for a dime---dime%1:21:00:: and the company---company%1:14:01:: was quickly able to declare very liberal dividends---dividend%1:21:00:: on its capital stock---capital_stock%1:21:00:: .
In 1879 the same Clark Wait---person%1:03:00:: , with H. H. Holley---person%1:03:00:: of South Dorset---location%1:03:00:: , formed the `` American Telegraph Line---group%1:03:00:: '' , extending from Manchester Depot---location%1:03:00:: via Factory Point---location%1:03:00:: and South Dorset---location%1:03:00:: to Dorset---location%1:03:00:: .
Besides being most convenient , the line---line%1:06:01:: `` soon proved a good investment---investment%1:04:00:: for the owners---owner%1:18:00:: '' .
Telegraphers---telegrapher%1:18:00:: at the Depot---location%1:03:00:: at this time---time%1:11:00:: were Aaron C. Burr---person%1:03:00:: and Mark Manley---person%1:03:00:: of `` Burr and Manley---group%1:03:00:: '' , dealers---dealer%1:18:02:: in lumber---lumber%1:27:00:: and dry goods---drygoods%1:06:00:: .
Early equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: was very flimsy ; the smallest gusts---gust%1:19:00:: of wind---wind%1:19:00:: toppled poles---pole%1:06:00:: , making communications---communication%1:10:01:: impossible .
But companies---company%1:14:01:: continued to spring up .
By 1883 the `` Battenkill Telegraph Company---group%1:03:00:: '' was in existence---existence%1:26:00:: and Alvin Pettibone---person%1:03:00:: was its president---president%1:18:01:: .
Operating in 1887 was the `` Valley Telegraph Line---group%1:03:00:: '' , officers---officer%1:18:02:: of which were E. C. Orvis---person%1:03:00:: , president---president%1:18:01:: ; H. K. Fowler---person%1:03:00:: , vice-president---vice_president%1:18:00:: and secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: ; J. N. Hard---person%1:03:00:: , treasurer---treasurer%1:18:00:: ; F. H. Walker---person%1:03:00:: , superintendent---superintendent%1:18:00:: ; H. S. Walker---person%1:03:00:: , assistant superintendent---superintendent%1:18:00:: .
Two companies---company%1:14:01:: now had headquarters---headquarters%1:06:01:: with Clark J. Wait---person%1:03:00:: , who by then had his own drugstore---drugstore%1:06:00:: at Factory Point---location%1:03:00:: - the `` Northern Union Telegraph Company---group%1:03:00:: '' and the `` Western Union---group%1:03:00:: '' .
Operators---operator%1:18:00:: were Arthur Koop---person%1:03:00:: and Norman Taylor---person%1:03:00:: .
Still existing on a `` Northern Union---group%1:03:00:: '' telegraph form---telegraph_form%1:10:00:: is a typical peremptory message---message%1:10:01:: from Peru---location%1:03:00:: grocer---grocer%1:18:00:: J. J. Hapgood---person%1:03:00:: to Burton---person%1:03:00:: and Graves---person%1:03:00:: ' store---store%1:06:00:: in Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: - `` Get and send by stage---stage%1:06:01:: sure four pounds---pound%1:23:09:: best Porterhouse---porterhouse%1:13:00:: or sirloin---sirloin%1:13:00:: steak---steak%1:13:00:: , for Mrs. Hapgood---person%1:03:00:: send six sweet oranges---sweet_orange%1:13:00:: '' .
About 1888 J. E. McNaughton---person%1:03:00:: of Barnumville---location%1:03:00:: and E. G. Bacon---person%1:03:00:: became proprietors---proprietor%1:18:00:: of the `` Green Mountain Telegraph Company---group%1:03:00:: '' , connecting all offices---office%1:06:00:: on the Western Union---group%1:03:00:: line---line%1:06:01:: and extending over the mountain---mountain%1:17:00:: from Barnumville---location%1:03:00:: to Peru---location%1:03:00:: , Londonderry---location%1:03:00:: , South Londonderry---location%1:03:00:: , Lowell Lake---location%1:03:00:: , Windham---location%1:03:00:: , North Windham---location%1:03:00:: , Grafton---location%1:03:00:: , Cambridgeport---location%1:03:00:: , Saxton 's River---location%1:03:00:: , and Bellows Falls---location%1:03:00:: .
From 1896 until 1910 John H. Whipple---person%1:03:00:: was manager---manager%1:18:00:: of Western Union---group%1:03:00:: at the Center---location%1:03:00:: in the drugstore---drugstore%1:06:00:: he purchased from Clark Wait---person%1:03:00:: .
The Village---village%1:14:00:: office---office%1:06:00:: of Western Union---group%1:03:00:: with George Towsley---person%1:03:00:: as manager---manager%1:18:00:: and telegrapher---telegrapher%1:18:00:: continued in Hard---person%1:03:00:: 's drugstore---drugstore%1:06:00:: until 1905 .
During the summers---summer%1:28:00:: , Towsley---person%1:03:00:: often needed the assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: of a company operator---company_operator%1:18:00:: .
These were the years---year%1:28:01:: when people---people%1:14:00:: flocked to Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: not only to play golf---golf%1:04:00:: , which had come into vogue---vogue%1:09:00:: , but also to witness the Ekwanok---location%1:03:00:: Country Club---country_club%1:14:00:: tournaments---tournament%1:11:00:: .
New Yorkers---new_yorker%1:18:00:: were kept informed of scores---scores%1:23:00:: by reporters---reporter%1:18:00:: who telegraphed fifteen to twenty thousand words---word%1:10:00:: daily to the metropolitan newspapers---newspaper%1:14:00:: .
This boosted local telegraph---telegraph%1:06:00:: business---business%1:04:02:: and Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: basked in all the free advertising---advertising%1:04:00:: .
In 1914 when the town---town%1:15:00:: was chosen for the U. S. Amateur Golf---group%1:03:00:: tournament---tournament%1:11:00:: , a representative---representative%1:18:02:: hurried here from the Boston---boston%1:15:00:: manager---manager%1:18:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: .
In his wake---wake%1:19:00:: came the District Traffic Supervisor---person%1:03:00:: and the cream---cream%1:14:00:: of the telegraphic profession---profession%1:14:00:: , ten---ten%1:23:00:: of Boston---boston%1:15:00:: 's best , chosen for their long experience---experience%1:09:01:: and thorough knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of golf---golf%1:04:00:: .
During that tournament---tournament%1:11:00:: alone , some 250000 words---word%1:10:00:: winged their way---way%1:04:02:: out of Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: .
The old Morse---morse%1:10:00:: system---system%1:09:02:: was replaced locally by the Simplex modern automatic method---method%1:09:00:: in 1929 , when Ellamae Heckman---person%1:03:00:: ( Wilcox---person%1:03:00:: ) was manager---manager%1:18:00:: of the Western Union---group%1:03:00:: office---office%1:06:00:: .
During summers---summer%1:28:00:: , business---business%1:04:02:: was so brisk that Mrs. Wilcox---person%1:03:00:: had two assistants---assistant%1:18:00:: and a messenger---messenger%1:18:00:: .
She was succeeded by Clarence Goyette---person%1:03:00:: .
Since that time---time%1:11:00:: the telegraph---telegraph%1:06:00:: office---office%1:06:00:: has shifted in location---location%1:04:01:: from the railroad station---railroad_station%1:06:00:: at the Depot---location%1:03:00:: and shops---shop%1:06:00:: at the Center---location%1:03:00:: back to the town clerk---town_clerk%1:18:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: and drugstore---drugstore%1:06:00:: at the Village---village%1:14:00:: .
After being located for some years---year%1:28:01:: in the Village---location%1:03:00:: at the Equinox Pharmacy---group%1:03:00:: under the supervision---supervision%1:04:00:: of Mrs. Harry Mercier---person%1:03:00:: , it is presently located in the Hill and Dale Shop---group%1:03:00:: , Manchester Center---location%1:03:00:: .
The first known telephone line---telephone_line%1:06:01:: in Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: was established in July---july%1:28:00:: 1883 between Burr---person%1:03:00:: and Manley---person%1:03:00:: 's store---store%1:06:00:: at Manchester Depot---location%1:03:00:: and the Kent and Root Marble Company---group%1:03:00:: in South Dorset---location%1:03:00:: .
This was extended the following year---year%1:28:01:: to include the railroad station---railroad_station%1:06:00:: agent---agent%1:18:02:: 's office---office%1:14:01:: and Thayer---location%1:03:00:: 's Hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: at Factory Point---location%1:03:00:: .
In November---november%1:28:00:: 1887 a line---line%1:06:01:: connecting several dwelling houses---dwelling_house%1:06:00:: in Dorset---location%1:03:00:: was extended to Manchester Depot---location%1:03:00:: .
Telephone wires---telephone_wire%1:06:00:: from Louis Dufresne---person%1:03:00:: 's house---house%1:06:00:: in East Manchester---location%1:03:00:: to the Dufresne---location%1:03:00:: lumber---lumber%1:27:00:: job---job%1:06:00:: near Bourn Pond---location%1:03:00:: were up about 1895 .
Eber L. Taylor---person%1:03:00:: of Manchester Depot---location%1:03:00:: recorded the setting of phone---phone%1:06:00:: poles---pole%1:06:00:: in East Dorset---location%1:03:00:: and Barnumville---location%1:03:00:: in his diary---diary%1:10:00:: for 1906 .
These must have been for local calls---local_call%1:10:00:: strictly , as in May---may%1:28:00:: 1900 the `` only long distance---distance%1:07:00:: telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: '' in town---town%1:15:00:: was transferred from C. B. Carleton---person%1:03:00:: 's to Young---person%1:03:00:: 's shoe store---shoe_store%1:06:00:: .
A small single switchboard---switchboard%1:06:00:: was installed in the Village---location%1:03:00:: over Woodcock---person%1:03:00:: 's hardware store---hardware_store%1:06:00:: ( later E. H. Hemenway---person%1:03:00:: 's ) .
George Woodcock---person%1:03:00:: was manager---manager%1:18:00:: and troubleshooter---troubleshooter%1:18:00:: ; Elizabeth Way---person%1:03:00:: was the first operator---operator%1:18:00:: ; and a night---night%1:28:00:: operator---operator%1:18:00:: was also employed .
Anyone fortunate enough to have one of those early phones---phone%1:06:00:: advertised the fact---fact%1:10:01:: along with the telephone number---telephone_number%1:10:00:: in the Manchester Journal---location%1:03:00:: .
In 1918 the New England Telephone Company---group%1:03:00:: began erecting a building---building%1:06:00:: to house its operations---operation%1:04:03:: on the corner---corner%1:06:00:: of U. S. Rte. 7---location%1:03:00:: and what is now Memorial Avenue---location%1:03:00:: at Manchester Center---location%1:03:00:: .
Service---service%1:04:08:: running through Barnumville---location%1:03:00:: and to Bennington County---location%1:03:00:: towns---town%1:15:00:: east of the mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: was in the hands---hands%1:04:00:: of the `` Gleason Telephone Company---group%1:03:00:: '' in 1925 , but major supervision---supervision%1:04:00:: of telephone lines---telephone_line%1:06:01:: in Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: was with the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company---group%1:03:00:: , which eventually gained all control---control%1:07:00:: .
More aerial and underground equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: was installed as well as office---office%1:06:00:: improvements---improvement%1:11:00:: to take care of the expanding business---business%1:14:00:: .
In 1931 Mrs. F. H. Briggs---person%1:03:00:: , agent---agent%1:18:01:: and chief operator---operator%1:18:00:: , who was to retire in 1946 with thirty years---year%1:28:01:: ' service---service%1:04:07:: , led agency---agency%1:14:01:: offices---office%1:14:01:: in sales---sale%1:04:00:: for the year---year%1:28:01:: with $ 2490 .
William Hitchcock---person%1:03:00:: , who retired in 1938 , was a veteran---veteran%1:18:00:: of thirty-four years---years%1:28:00:: ' local service---service%1:04:07:: .
Another veteran telephone operator---telephone_operator%1:18:00:: was Edith Fleming Blackmer---person%1:03:00:: , who had been in the office---office%1:06:00:: forty years---years%1:28:00:: at the time---time%1:28:06:: of her death---death%1:11:00:: in 1960 .
In 1932 Dorset---person%1:03:00:: received its own exchange---exchange%1:06:01:: , which made business---business%1:04:01:: easier for the Manchester---location%1:03:00:: office---office%1:14:01:: , but it was not until February---february%1:28:00:: 1953 that area---area%1:15:01:: service---service%1:04:08:: was extended to include Manchester---location%1:03:00:: and Dorset---location%1:03:00:: .
This eliminated toll calls---toll_call%1:10:00:: between the two towns---town%1:15:00:: .
Within a month---month%1:28:01:: , calls---call%1:10:01:: were up seventy per cent---percent%1:24:00:: .
Electricity---electricity%1:19:01:: plays such an important part---part%1:04:01:: in community life---life%1:26:01:: today that it is difficult to envision a time---time%1:28:00:: when current---current%1:19:01:: was not available for daily use---use%1:04:00:: .
Yet one has to go back only some sixty years---year%1:28:01:: .
The first mention---mention%1:10:01:: of an electric plant---plant%1:06:01:: in Manchester---manchester%1:15:01:: seems to be one installed in Reuben Colvin---person%1:03:00:: 's and Houghton---person%1:03:00:: 's gristmill---gristmill%1:06:00:: on the West Branch---location%1:03:00:: in Factory Point---location%1:03:00:: .
No records---record%1:10:03:: are available as to the date---date%1:28:00:: or extent---extent%1:07:00:: of installation---installation%1:04:00:: , but it may have been in 1896 .
On June 14---june_14%1:28:00:: , 1900 the Manchester Journal reported that an electrical engineer---electrical_engineer%1:18:00:: was installing an electric light---electric_light%1:06:00:: plant---plant%1:06:01:: for Edward S. Isham---person%1:03:00:: at `` Ormsby Hill---location%1:03:00:: '' .
This was working by the end---end%1:28:00:: of August---august%1:28:00:: and giving satisfactory service---service%1:04:08:: .
In November---november%1:28:00:: 1900 surveying---surveying%1:04:00:: was done under John Marsden---person%1:03:00:: on the east mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: to ascertain if it would be possible to get sufficient water---water%1:27:00:: and fall---fall%1:17:00:: to operate an electric power plant---power_plant%1:06:00:: .
Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: came of it , perhaps due to lack---lack%1:26:00:: of opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: for water---water%1:27:00:: storage---storage%1:04:00:: .
The next step---step%1:04:02:: was construction---construction%1:04:00:: by the Manchester Light and Power Company---group%1:03:00:: of a plant---plant%1:06:01:: on the west bank---bank%1:17:01:: of the Battenkill---location%1:03:00:: south of Union Street---location%1:03:00:: bridge---bridge%1:06:00:: .
This was nearly completed May---may%1:28:00:: 23 , 1901 with a promise---promise%1:10:00:: of lights---light%1:06:00:: by June---june%1:28:00:: 10 , but the first light---light%1:06:00:: did not go on until September---september%1:28:00:: 28 .
It was at the end---end%1:15:00:: of the sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: in front of the Dellwood Cemetery---group%1:03:00:: cottage---cottage%1:06:00:: .
The first directors---director%1:18:00:: of the Manchester Light and Power Company---group%1:03:00:: were John Marsden---person%1:03:00:: , M. L. Manley---person%1:03:00:: , William F. Orvis---person%1:03:00:: , George Smith---person%1:03:00:: , and John Blackmer---person%1:03:00:: .
The officers---officer%1:18:02:: were John Marsden---person%1:03:00:: , president---president%1:18:01:: ; John C. Blackmer---person%1:03:00:: , vice-president---vice_president%1:18:00:: ; George Smith---person%1:03:00:: , treasurer---treasurer%1:18:00:: ; and William F. Orvis---person%1:03:00:: , secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: .
Marsden---person%1:03:00:: was manager---manager%1:18:00:: of the company---company%1:14:01:: for ten years---year%1:28:01:: and manager---manager%1:18:00:: of its successor---successor%1:09:00:: company---company%1:14:01:: , the Colonial Light and Power Company---group%1:03:00:: , for one year---year%1:28:01:: .
At about the time---time%1:11:00:: the Marsden---person%1:03:00:: enterprise---enterprise%1:04:00:: was getting under way , the Vail Light and Lumber Company---group%1:03:00:: started construction---construction%1:04:00:: of a chair---chair%1:06:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: factory---factory%1:06:00:: on the site---site%1:15:00:: of the present Bennington Co-operative Creamery---group%1:03:00:: , intending to use its surplus power---power%1:19:00:: for generating electricity---electricity%1:19:01:: .
Manchester---location%1:03:00:: then had two competing power companies---power_company%1:14:00:: until 1904 , when the Manchester Light and Power Company---group%1:03:00:: purchased the transmission---transmission%1:04:01:: system---system%1:06:00:: of the Vail Company---group%1:03:00:: .
This was fortunate , as the Vail---group%1:03:00:: plant---plant%1:06:01:: burned in 1905 .
The Colonial Light and Power Company---group%1:03:00:: was succeeded by the Vermont Hydro-Electric Corporation---group%1:03:00:: , which in turn was absorbed by the Central Vermont Public Service Corporation---group%1:03:00:: .
The latter now furnishes the area---area%1:15:01:: with electricity---electricity%1:19:01:: distributed from a modern sub-station---substation%1:06:00:: at Manchester Depot---location%1:03:00:: which was put into operation---operation%1:26:00:: February---february%1:28:00:: 19 , 1930 and was improved in January---january%1:28:00:: 1942 by the installation---installation%1:04:00:: of larger transformers---transformer%1:06:00:: .
For a time---time%1:11:00:: following the abandonment---abandonment%1:04:03:: of the local plant---plant%1:06:01:: , electric current---electric_current%1:19:00:: for Manchester---location%1:03:00:: was brought in from the south---south%1:15:02:: with an emergency---emergency%1:11:00:: tie-in---tie-in%1:06:00:: with the Vermont Marble Company---group%1:03:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: to the north .
She concluded by asking him to name another hour---hour%1:28:01:: should this one---one%1:23:00:: be inconvenient .
The fish---fish%1:18:00:: took the bait---bait%1:09:00:: .
He replied that he could not imagine what importance---importance%1:07:00:: there might be in thus meeting with a stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: , but - joy---joy%1:09:00:: of joys---joy%1:09:00:: , he would be at home at the hour---hour%1:28:01:: mentioned .
But when she called he had thought better of the matter---matter%1:09:01:: and decided not to involve himself in a new entanglement---entanglement%1:06:00:: .
She was told by the manservant---manservant%1:18:00:: who opened the door---door%1:06:00:: that his lordship---lordship%1:10:00:: was engaged on work---work%1:04:00:: from which he had left strict orders---order%1:10:03:: he was not to be disturbed .
Claire---person%1:03:00:: was bitterly disappointed but determined not to let the rebuff---rebuff%1:04:00:: daunt her purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: .
She wrote again and now , abandoning for the moment the theme---theme%1:10:00:: of love---love%1:12:00:: , she asked for help---help%1:04:00:: in the matter---matter%1:09:01:: of her career---career%1:04:00:: .
His lordship---lordship%1:10:00:: was concerned in the management---management%1:04:00:: of Drury Lane but , if there were no opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: there , would he read and criticize her novel---novel%1:10:00:: ?
At last he consented to meet her , and following that brief interview---interview%1:10:00:: Claire---person%1:03:00:: wrote him a yet more remarkable proposal---proposal%1:10:00:: :
Have you any objection---objection%1:10:01:: to the following plan---plan%1:09:00:: ?
On Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: evening---evening%1:28:00:: we may go out of town---town%1:15:00:: together by some stage---stage%1:06:01:: or mail---mail%1:06:01:: about the distance---distance%1:07:00:: of ten or twelve miles---mile%1:23:01:: .
There we shall be free and unknown ; we can return the following morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
She concluded by asking for a brief interview---interview%1:10:00:: - `` to settle with you where '' - and she threw in a tribute---tribute%1:10:01:: to his `` gentle manners---manners%1:07:00:: '' and `` the wild originality---originality%1:07:00:: of your countenance---countenance%1:07:00:: '' .
She opened his reply---reply%1:10:01:: with trembling fingers---finger%1:08:00:: .
And he would see her that evening---evening%1:28:00:: .
Victory---victory%1:11:00:: at last !
At their meeting---meeting%1:14:01:: he told her not to bother about `` where '' - he would attend to that .
There was one of the new forte-pianos---forte-piano%1:06:00:: in the room---room%1:06:00:: and , as Claire---person%1:03:00:: rose to go , he asked her to sing him one song---song%1:10:00:: before she left .
She sang him Scott---person%1:03:00:: 's charming ballad---ballad%1:10:01:: `` Rosabelle '' , which was the vogue---vogue%1:09:00:: of the moment---moment%1:28:00:: .
`` Your voice---voice%1:07:00:: is delightful '' , he approved with a warm smile---smile%1:10:00:: .
`` Tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:01:: will be a new experience---experience%1:11:00:: - I have never before made love to a nightingale---nightingale%1:05:00:: .
There have been cooing doves---dove%1:05:00:: , chattering magpies---magpie%1:05:00:: , thieving jackdaws---jackdaw%1:05:00:: , a proud peacock---peacock%1:05:02:: , a silly goose---goose%1:05:00:: , and a harpy eagle---harpy_eagle%1:05:00:: - whom I was silly enough to mate with and who is now busy tearing at my vitals---vitals%1:08:00:: '' .
And so they went , he choosing of all places---place%1:15:00:: an inn---inn%1:06:00:: near Medmenham Abbey , scene---scene%1:15:00:: a generation---generation%1:28:00:: ago of the obscene orgies---orgy%1:04:00:: of the Hellfire Club .
He regaled Claire---person%1:03:00:: with an account---account%1:10:00:: of the mock mass---mass%1:04:00:: performed by the cassocked bloods---blood%1:18:00:: , which he had had at firsthand from old Bud Dodington---person%1:03:00:: , one of the leaders---leader%1:18:00:: of the so-called `` Order '' .
Each wore the monkish scourge---scourge%1:06:00:: at his waist---waist%1:08:00:: but this , it seems , was not employed for self-flagellation---self-flagellation%1:04:00:: .
Naked girls---girl%1:18:00:: danced in the chancel---chancel%1:06:00:: of the Abbey , the youngest and seemingly the most innocent being chosen to read a sermon---sermon%1:10:00:: filled with veiled depravities---depravity%1:04:00:: .
The jaded amorist---amorist%1:18:00:: conjured up pictures---picture%1:09:00:: of the blasphemous rites---rite%1:04:00:: with relish---relish%1:12:02:: .
Alas , all that belonged to the age---age%1:28:02:: of `` Devil Dashwood '' and `` Wicked Wilkes '' , abbot---abbot%1:18:00:: and beadsman---beadsman%1:18:00:: of the Order !
The casual seduction---seduction%1:04:00:: of a seventeen year---year%1:28:01:: old bluestocking---bluestocking%1:18:00:: seemed tame by comparison---comparison%1:24:00:: .
They passed close by the turn---turn%1:25:00:: to Bishopsgate .
A scant half mile---half_mile%1:23:00:: away Shelley---person%1:03:00:: and Mary---person%1:03:00:: were doubtless sitting on their diminutive terrace---terrace%1:06:00:: , the air---air%1:27:00:: about them scented with stock---stock%1:13:01:: , and listening to the nightingale---nightingale%1:05:00:: who had nested in the big lime tree---lime_tree%1:20:01:: at the foot---foot%1:15:00:: of the garden---garden%1:06:01:: .
Charming and peaceful - but what were charm---charm%1:07:00:: and peace---peace%1:12:00:: compared to high adventure---adventure%1:04:00:: ?
Alone with the fabulous Byron---person%1:03:00:: !
How many women---woman%1:18:00:: had longed for the privilege---privilege%1:07:02:: that was hers .
How was she to behave , Claire---person%1:03:00:: wondered .
She was the pursuer---pursuer%1:18:00:: as clearly as was Venus---person%1:03:00:: in Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: 's poem---poem%1:10:00:: .
And while her Adonis---adonis%1:18:01:: did not suffer from inexperience---inexperience%1:09:00:: , satiety---satiety%1:26:00:: might well be an equal handicap---handicap%1:26:00:: .
No , she would not pretend modesty---modesty%1:07:00:: , but neither must she be crudely bold .
Mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: - that was the thing---thing%1:09:01:: .
In the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: she would insist on darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: .
With his club foot---clubfoot%1:26:00:: he might well be grateful .
At the inn---inn%1:06:00:: , which was situated close to a broad weir---weir%1:06:00:: , Byron---person%1:03:00:: was greeted by the landlord---landlord%1:18:00:: with obsequious deference---deference%1:04:00:: and addressed as `` milord '' .
The place---place%1:15:00:: was evidently a familiar haunt---haunt%1:15:00:: and Claire---person%1:03:00:: wondered what other illicit loves---love%1:18:00:: had been celebrated in the comfortable rooms---rooms%1:06:00:: to which they were shown .
The fire---fire%1:06:00:: in the sitting room---sitting_room%1:06:00:: was lighted .
`` What about the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: '' ?
Byron---person%1:03:00:: inquired .
`` Seems to me last time---time%1:11:00:: I was here the grate---grate%1:06:00:: bellowed out smoke---smoke%1:19:00:: as it might have been preparing us for hell '' .
`` We found some owls---owl%1:05:00:: had built a nest---nest%1:17:00:: in the chimney---chimney%1:06:00:: , milord , but I promise you you 'll never have trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: of that sort---sort%1:09:00:: again '' .
Claire---person%1:03:00:: felt suddenly small and cheap , heroine---heroine%1:18:01:: of a trivial episode---episode%1:11:00:: in the voluminous history---history%1:10:00:: of Don Juan---person%1:03:00:: .
A cold supper---supper%1:13:00:: was ordered and a bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: of port---port%1:13:00:: .
When Napoleon---person%1:03:00:: 's ship---ship%1:06:00:: had borne him to Elba---location%1:03:00:: , French wines---wine%1:13:00:: had started to cross the Channel---location%1:03:00:: , the first shipments---shipment%1:06:00:: in a dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: war-ridden years---year%1:28:01:: , but the supplies had not yet reached rural hostelries---hostelry%1:06:00:: where the sweet wines---wine%1:13:00:: of the Spanish peninsula---peninsula%1:17:00:: still ruled .
As they waited for supper---supper%1:13:00:: they sat by the fire---fire%1:06:00:: , glasses---glass%1:06:00:: in hand , while Byron---person%1:03:00:: philosophized as much for his own entertainment---entertainment%1:04:00:: as hers .
`` Sex---sex%1:04:00:: is overpriced '' , he said .
`` The great Greek tragedies---tragedy%1:10:00:: are concerned with man against Fate---fate%1:18:00:: , not man---man%1:18:00:: against man---man%1:18:00:: for the prize---prize%1:21:00:: of a woman---woman%1:18:00:: 's body---body%1:08:00:: .
So do n't see yourself as a heroine---heroine%1:18:01:: or fancy this little adventure---adventure%1:04:00:: is an event---event%1:03:00:: of major importance---importance%1:07:00:: '' .
`` The gods---god%1:18:01:: seemed to think sex---sex%1:04:00:: pretty important '' , she rebutted .
`` Mars and Venus , Bacchus and Ariadne , Jupiter and Io , Byron---person%1:03:00:: and the nymph---nymph%1:18:00:: of the owl---owl%1:05:00:: 's nest---nest%1:17:00:: .
Was n't the owl---owl%1:05:00:: her symbol---symbol%1:10:00:: '' ?
Byron---person%1:03:00:: laughed .
`` So you know something of the classics---classics%1:09:00:: , do you '' ?
`` I 'll tell you nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
I do n't ask you who ' tis you 're being unfaithful to , husband---husband%1:18:00:: or lover---lover%1:18:00:: .
For a moment---moment%1:28:01:: she thought of answering with the truth---truth%1:10:00:: but she knew there were men---man%1:18:00:: who shied away from virginity---virginity%1:26:00:: , who demanded some degree---degree%1:26:01:: of education---education%1:07:01:: in body---body%1:08:00:: as well as mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
What matter the others so long as I have my place---place%1:09:00:: in history---history%1:10:00:: '' .
No man---man%1:18:00:: ever had a better opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: of himself and indeed , with one so favored , flattery---flattery%1:10:00:: could hardly seem overdone .
Brains---brain%1:09:00:: and beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: , high position---position%1:26:00:: in both the social and intellectual worlds---world%1:14:01:: , athlete---athlete%1:18:00:: , fabled lover---lover%1:18:00:: - if ever the world was any man's oyster it was his .
The light supper---supper%1:13:00:: over , Claire---person%1:03:00:: went to him and , slipping an arm---arm%1:08:00:: about his shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: , sat on his knee---knee%1:08:00:: .
He drew her close and , hand---hand%1:08:00:: on cheek---cheek%1:08:00:: , turned her face---face%1:08:00:: to his .
Her lips---lip%1:08:00:: , moist and parted , spoke his name---name%1:10:00:: .
`` Byron---person%1:03:00:: '' !
His hand---hand%1:08:00:: went to her shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: and pushed aside the knotted scarf---scarf%1:06:00:: that surmounted the striped poplin---poplin%1:06:00:: gown---gown%1:06:00:: ; then , to better purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: , he took hold of the knot---knot%1:06:00:: and with dextrous fingers---finger%1:08:00:: , untied it .
The bodice---bodice%1:06:00:: beneath was buttoned and , withdrawing his lips---lip%1:08:00:: from hers , he set her upright on his knee---knee%1:08:00:: and started to undo it , unhurriedly as if she were a child---child%1:18:00:: .
But , kindled by his kiss---kiss%1:04:00:: , his caressing hand---hand%1:08:00:: , her desire---desire%1:26:00:: was aflame .
She sprang up and went swiftly to the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: .
Lord Byron---person%1:03:00:: poured himself another glass---glass%1:23:00:: of wine---wine%1:13:00:: and held it up to the candle flame---candle_flame%1:19:00:: admiring the rich color---color%1:07:00:: .
He drank slowly with due appreciation---appreciation%1:04:00:: .
It was an excellent vintage---vintage%1:13:00:: .
He rose and went to the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: .
Pausing in the doorway---doorway%1:06:00:: he said : `` The form---form%1:08:00:: of the human female---female%1:18:00:: , unlike her mind---mind%1:09:00:: and her spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: , is the most challenging loveliness---loveliness%1:07:00:: in all nature---nature%1:17:00:: '' .
When Claire---person%1:03:00:: returned to Bishopsgate she longed to tell them she had become Byron---person%1:03:00:: 's mistress---mistress%1:18:01:: .
By odd coincidence---coincidence%1:11:00:: , on the evening---evening%1:28:00:: of her return---return%1:04:01:: Shelley---person%1:03:00:: chose to read Parisina , which was the latest of the titled poet---poet%1:18:00:: 's successes---success%1:04:00:: .
As he declaimed the sonorous measures---measure%1:10:01:: , it was as much as Claire---person%1:03:00:: could do to restrain herself from bursting out with her dramatic tidings---tidings%1:10:00:: .
`` Although it is not the best of which he is capable '' , said Shelley---person%1:03:00:: as he closed the book---book%1:06:00:: , `` it is still poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: of a high order---order%1:07:01:: '' .
`` If he would only leave the East---location%1:03:00:: '' , said Mary---person%1:03:00:: .
`` I am tired of sultans---sultan%1:18:00:: and scimitars---scimitar%1:06:00:: '' .
`` The hero---hero%1:09:00:: of his next poem---poem%1:10:00:: is Napoleon Bonaparte---person%1:03:00:: '' , said Claire---person%1:03:00:: , with slightly overdone carelessness---carelessness%1:07:00:: .
`` How do you know that '' ? demanded Mary---person%1:03:00:: .
`` I was told it on good authority '' , Claire---person%1:03:00:: answered darkly .
Winter---winter%1:28:00:: came , and with it Mary---person%1:03:00:: 's baby---baby%1:18:00:: - a boy---boy%1:18:03:: as she had wished .
William---person%1:03:00:: , he was called , in honor---honor%1:26:00:: of the man---man%1:18:00:: who was at once Shelley---person%1:03:00:: 's pensioner---pensioner%1:18:00:: and his most bitter detractor---detractor%1:18:00:: .
With a pardonable irony---irony%1:10:01:: Shelley---person%1:03:00:: wrote to the father---father%1:18:00:: who had publicly disowned his daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: :
`` Fanny---person%1:03:00:: and Mrs. Godwin---person%1:03:00:: will probably be glad to hear that Mary---person%1:03:00:: has safely recovered from a very favorable confinement---confinement%1:26:01:: , and that her child---child%1:18:01:: is well '' .
At the same time another child---child%1:18:01:: - this one of Shelley---person%1:03:00:: 's brain---brain%1:09:00:: - was given to the world---world%1:17:01:: : Alastor , a poem---poem%1:10:00:: of pervading beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: in which the reader---reader%1:18:00:: may gaze into the still depths---depth%1:07:00:: of a fine mind---mind%1:09:00:: 's musings---musing%1:09:00:: .
Shelley---person%1:03:00:: sent a copy---copy%1:10:01:: to Southey---person%1:03:00:: , a former friend---friend%1:18:00:: , and another to Godwin---person%1:03:00:: .
Neither acknowledged the gift---gift%1:21:00:: .
Only Mary---person%1:03:00:: 's praise---praise%1:10:00:: sustained him in his disappointment---disappointment%1:12:00:: .
Not a thought---thought%1:09:01:: nor a cadence---cadence%1:10:01:: was missed in her summary---summary%1:10:00:: of appreciation---appreciation%1:09:00:: .
`` You have made the labor---labor%1:04:00:: worth while '' , he said to her , smiling---smiling%1:10:00:: .
`` And in the future---future%1:28:00:: , since I write for a public---public%1:14:00:: of one---one%1:23:00:: , I can save the poor publishers---publisher%1:14:00:: from wasting their money---money%1:21:00:: '' .
`` A public---public%1:14:00:: of one---one%1:23:00:: '' , Mary---person%1:03:00:: echoed reprovingly .
`` how can you say such a thing---thing%1:10:00:: ?
There will be thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: who will thrill to the loveliness---loveliness%1:07:00:: of Alastor .
What about that dear , clever Mr. Thynne---person%1:03:00:: ?
I am sure he is in raptures---rapture%1:26:00:: '' .
`` Poor Mr. Thynne---person%1:03:00:: , he always has to be trotted out for my encouragement---encouragement%1:04:00:: '' .
`` There are other Mr. Thynnes---person%1:03:00:: .
Not everyone is bewitched by Byron---person%1:03:00:: 's caliphs---caliph%1:18:00:: and harem---harem%1:06:00:: beauties---beauty%1:18:00:: '' .
Mary---person%1:03:00:: 's super critical attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: toward Byron---person%1:03:00:: had nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to do with his moral disrepute---disrepute%1:26:00:: .
She was resentful of his easy success---success%1:26:00:: as compared with Shelley---person%1:03:00:: 's failure---failure%1:04:00:: .
The same month---month%1:28:01:: that Alastor was published , Murray sold twenty thousand---thousand%1:23:00:: copies---copy%1:10:01:: of The Siege of Corinth , a slovenly bit---bit%1:17:00:: of Byronism that even Shelley---person%1:03:00:: 's generosity---generosity%1:07:00:: rebelled at .
The lordly poet---poet%1:18:00:: was at low-water mark---low-water_mark%1:26:00:: .
The careless writing---writing%1:04:02:: was in keeping---keeping%1:04:01:: with his mood---mood%1:12:00:: of savage discontent---discontent%1:12:00:: .
On all sides---side%1:09:00:: doors---door%1:07:00:: were being slammed in his face---face%1:08:00:: .
The previous scandals---scandal%1:11:00:: , gaily diverting as they were , had only served to increase his popularity---popularity%1:07:00:: .
Now , under the impact---impact%1:19:00:: of his wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's disclosures---disclosure%1:10:00:: , he was brought suddenly to the realization---realization%1:09:00:: that there was a limit---limit%1:28:00:: to tolerance---tolerance%1:07:04:: , however brilliant , however far-famed the offender---offender%1:18:00:: might be .
He tried defiance---defiance%1:07:00:: and openly flaunted his devotion---devotion%1:12:00:: to his half sister---half_sister%1:18:00:: , but he soon saw , as did she , that this course---course%1:04:00:: if persisted in would involve them in a common ruin---ruin%1:26:00:: .
For the moment there was no woman---woman%1:18:00:: in his life---life%1:26:02:: , and it was this vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: that had given Claire---person%1:03:00:: her opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: .
But the liaison---liaison%1:26:00:: successfully started in the last days---day%1:28:00:: of autumn---autumn%1:28:00:: was now languishing .
Byron---person%1:03:00:: , since the separation---separation%1:11:00:: from his wife---wife%1:18:00:: had been living in a smallish house---house%1:06:00:: in Piccadilly Terrace .
He refused to bring Claire---person%1:03:00:: to it even as an occasional visitor---visitor%1:18:00:: , claiming that his every move---move%1:04:03:: was watched by spies---spy%1:18:00:: of the Milbankes .
He brought with him a mixture---mixture%1:27:00:: of myrrh and aloes---aloes%1:06:00:: , of about a hundred pounds---pound%1:23:09:: ' weight---weight%1:07:00:: .
They took Jesus---jesus%1:18:00:: 's body---body%1:08:00:: , then , and wrapped it in winding-clothes---winding-clothes%1:06:00:: with the spices---spice%1:27:00:: ; that is how the Jews---jew%1:18:00:: prepare a body---body%1:08:00:: for burial---burial%1:11:00:: .
Listed as present at the Descent---descent%1:11:00:: were Mary---person%1:03:00:: , Mary---person%1:03:00:: 's sister---sister%1:18:00:: , Mary Magdalene---mary_magdalene%1:18:00:: , John---person%1:03:00:: , Joseph of Arimathea---person%1:03:00:: , Nicodemus---person%1:03:00:: .
Search as he might , he could find no place---place%1:10:00:: where the Bible---bible%1:10:00:: spoke of a moment---moment%1:28:00:: when Mary---person%1:03:00:: could have been alone with Jesus---jesus%1:18:00:: .
Mostly the scene---scene%1:15:00:: was crowded with mourners---mourner%1:18:00:: , such as the dramatic Dell'Arca Lamentation in Bologna---location%1:03:00:: , where the grief-stricken spectators---spectator%1:18:00:: had usurped Mary---person%1:03:00:: 's last poignant moment---moment%1:28:00:: .
In his concept---concept%1:09:00:: there could be no one else present .
His first desire---desire%1:12:00:: was to create a mother---mother%1:18:00:: and son---son%1:18:00:: alone in the universe---universe%1:17:00:: .
When might Mary---person%1:03:00:: have had that moment---moment%1:28:00:: to hold her child---child%1:18:01:: on her lap---lap%1:08:00:: ?
Perhaps after the soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: had laid him on the ground---ground%1:17:00:: , while Joseph of Arimathea---person%1:03:00:: was at Pontius Pilate---person%1:03:00:: 's asking for Christ---christ%1:18:00:: 's body---body%1:08:00:: , Nicodemus---person%1:03:00:: was gathering his mixture---mixture%1:27:00:: of myrrh and aloes---aloes%1:06:00:: , and the others had gone home to mourn .
Those who saw his finished Pieta would take the place---place%1:04:01:: of the biblical witnesses---witness%1:18:01:: .
They would feel what Mary---person%1:03:00:: was undergoing .
There would be no halos---halo%1:07:00:: , no angels---angel%1:18:00:: .
These would be two human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: , whom God---god%1:18:00:: had chosen .
He felt close to Mary---person%1:03:00:: , having spent so long concentrating on the beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: of her journey---journey%1:04:00:: .
Now she was intensely alive , anguished ; her son---son%1:18:00:: was dead .
Even though he would later be resurrected , he was at this moment---moment%1:28:00:: dead indeed , the expression---expression%1:07:00:: on his face---face%1:08:00:: reflecting what he had gone through on the cross---cross%1:06:01:: .
In his sculpture---sculpture%1:06:00:: therefore it would not be possible for him to project anything of what Jesus---jesus%1:18:00:: felt for his mother---mother%1:18:00:: ; only what Mary---person%1:03:00:: felt for her son---son%1:18:00:: .
Jesus---jesus%1:18:00:: ' inert body---body%1:08:00:: would be passive , his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: closed .
Mary---person%1:03:00:: would have to carry the human communication---communication%1:03:00:: .
It was a relief---relief%1:12:00:: to shift in his mind---mind%1:09:00:: to technical problems---problem%1:10:00:: .
Since his Christ---christ%1:18:00:: was to be life size , how was Mary---person%1:03:00:: to hold him on her lap---lap%1:08:00:: without the relationship---relationship%1:26:00:: seeming ungainly ?
His Mary---person%1:03:00:: would be slender of limb---limb%1:08:00:: and delicate of proportion---proportion%1:25:00:: , yet she must hold this full-grown man---man%1:18:00:: as securely and convincingly as she would a child---child%1:18:01:: .
There was only one way---way%1:04:01:: to accomplish this : by design---design%1:04:00:: , by drawing diagrams---diagram%1:06:00:: and sketches---sketch%1:06:00:: in which he probed the remotest corner---corner%1:15:02:: of his mind---mind%1:09:00:: for creative ideas---idea%1:09:00:: to carry his concept---concept%1:09:00:: .
He started by making free sketches---sketch%1:06:00:: to loosen up his thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: so that images---image%1:09:00:: would appear on paper---paper%1:27:00:: .
At the same time he started walking the streets---street%1:06:00:: , peering at the people---people%1:14:00:: passing or shopping at the stalls---stall%1:06:01:: , storing up fresh impressions---impression%1:09:00:: of what they looked like , how they moved .
In particular he sought the gentle , sweet-faced nuns---nun%1:18:00:: , with head coverings---head_covering%1:06:00:: and veils---veil%1:06:00:: coming to the middle---middle%1:15:00:: of their foreheads---forehead%1:08:00:: , remembering their expressions---expression%1:07:00:: until he reached home---home%1:15:04:: and set them down on paper---paper%1:27:00:: .
Discovering that draperies---drapery%1:06:00:: could be designed to serve structural purposes---purpose%1:07:00:: , he began a study---study%1:06:01:: of the anatomy---anatomy%1:04:00:: of folds---fold%1:25:00:: .
He improvised as he went along , completing a life-size clay---clay%1:27:00:: figure---figure%1:06:00:: , then bought yards---yard%1:23:00:: of an inexpensive material---material%1:06:00:: from a draper---draper%1:18:00:: , wet the lightweight cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: in a basin---basin%1:06:00:: and covered it over with clay---clay%1:27:00:: that Argiento---person%1:03:00:: brought from the bank---bank%1:17:01:: of the Tiber , to the consistency---consistency%1:07:00:: of thick mud---mud%1:27:00:: .
No fold---fold%1:25:00:: could be accidental , each turn---turn%1:11:00:: of the drapery---drapery%1:06:00:: had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna---person%1:03:00:: 's slender legs---leg%1:25:00:: and feet---foot%1:08:01:: so that they would give substantive support---support%1:06:01:: to Christ---christ%1:18:00:: 's body---body%1:08:00:: , to intensify her inner turmoil---turmoil%1:12:00:: .
No fold could be accidental , each turn of the drapery had to serve organically , to cover the Madonna 's slender legs---leg%1:08:01:: and feet so that they would give substantive support to Christ 's body , to intensify her inner turmoil .
When the cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: dried and stiffened , he saw what adjustments---adjustment%1:04:00:: had to be made .
`` So that 's sculpture---sculpture%1:06:00:: '' , commented Argiento---person%1:03:00:: wryly , when he had sluiced down the floor---floor%1:06:00:: for a week---week%1:28:00:: , `` making mud---mud%1:27:00:: pies---pie%1:13:00:: '' .
Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: grinned .
`` See , Argiento---person%1:03:00:: , if you control the way---way%1:07:01:: these folds---fold%1:25:00:: are bunched , like this , or made to flow , you can enrich the body---body%1:08:00:: attitudes---attitude%1:07:01:: .
They can have as much tactile appeal---appeal%1:07:00:: as flesh and bone '' .
He went into the Jewish quarter---location%1:03:00:: , wanting to draw Hebraic faces---face%1:08:00:: so that he could reach a visual understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of how Christ---christ%1:18:00:: might have looked .
The Jewish section---section%1:15:01:: was in Trastevere---location%1:03:00:: , near the Tiber at the church---church%1:06:00:: of San Francesco a Ripa---group%1:03:00:: .
The colony---colony%1:14:00:: had been small until the Spanish Inquisition of 1492 drove many Jews---jew%1:18:00:: into Rome---location%1:03:00:: .
Here , for the most part , they were well treated , as a `` reminder---reminder%1:09:00:: of the Old Testament---old_testament%1:10:00:: heritage---heritage%1:09:00:: of Christianity---christianity%1:09:00:: '' ; many of their gifted members---member%1:18:00:: were prominent in the Vatican---vatican%1:06:00:: as physicians---physician%1:18:00:: , musicians---musician%1:18:01:: , bankers---banker%1:18:00:: .
The men---man%1:18:00:: did not object to his sketching them while they went about their work---work%1:04:01:: , but no one could be persuaded to come to his studio---studio%1:06:00:: to pose .
He was told to ask for Rabbi Melzi---person%1:03:00:: at the synagogue---synagogue%1:06:00:: on Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: .
Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: found the rabbi---rabbi%1:18:00:: in the room---room%1:06:00:: of study---study%1:09:01:: , a gentle old man---old_man%1:18:02:: with a white beard---beard%1:08:00:: and luminous grey eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , robed in black gabardine---gabardine%1:06:00:: with a skullcap---skullcap%1:06:00:: on his head---head%1:08:00:: .
He was reading from the Talmud with a group---group%1:03:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: from his congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: .
When Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: explained why he had come , Rabbi Melzi---person%1:03:00:: replied gravely :
`` The Bible---bible%1:10:00:: forbids us to bow down to or to make graven images---graven_image%1:06:00:: .
That is why our creative people---people%1:14:00:: give their time---time%1:28:05:: to literature---literature%1:10:00:: , not to painting---painting%1:04:00:: or sculpture---sculpture%1:06:00:: '' .
`` But , Rabbi Melzi---person%1:03:00:: , you do n't object to others creating works of art---work_of_art%1:06:00:: '' ?
Each religion---religion%1:14:00:: has its own tenets---tenet%1:10:00:: '' .
`` I am carving a Pieta from white Carrara---location%1:03:00:: marble---marble%1:27:00:: .
I wish to make Jesus---jesus%1:18:00:: an authentic Jew---jew%1:18:00:: .
The rabbi---rabbi%1:18:00:: said thoughtfully , `` I would not want my people---people%1:14:00:: to get in trouble with the Church---church%1:14:00:: '' .
`` I am working for the Cardinal---cardinal%1:18:00:: of San Dionigi---location%1:03:00:: .
`` What kind---kind%1:09:00:: of models---model%1:18:00:: would you prefer '' ?
`` Workmen---workman%1:18:00:: .
In their mid thirties---mid-thirties%1:28:00:: .
Not bulky laborers---laborer%1:18:00:: , but sinewy men---man%1:18:00:: .
With intelligence---intelligence%1:09:00:: .
And sensitivity---sensitivity%1:12:00:: '' .
Rabbi Melzi---person%1:03:00:: smiled at him with infinitely old but merry eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
`` Leave me your address---address%1:15:00:: .
I will send you the best the quarter---quarter%1:15:00:: has to offer '' .
Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: hurried to Sangallo---person%1:03:00:: 's solitary bachelor---bachelor%1:18:00:: room---room%1:06:00:: with his sketches---sketch%1:06:00:: , asked the architect---architect%1:18:00:: to design a stand---stand%1:06:00:: which would simulate the seated Madonna---person%1:03:00:: .
Sangallo---person%1:03:00:: studied the drawings---drawing%1:10:00:: and improvised a trestle---trestle%1:06:01:: couch---couch%1:06:00:: .
Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: bought some scrap lumber---lumber%1:27:00:: .
Together he and Argiento---person%1:03:00:: built the stand---stand%1:06:00:: , covering it with blankets---blanket%1:06:00:: .
His first model---model%1:18:00:: arrived at dusk---dusk%1:28:00:: .
He hesitated for a moment---moment%1:28:00:: when Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: asked him to disrobe , so Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: gave him a piece---piece%1:06:00:: of toweling---toweling%1:06:00:: to wrap around his loins---loins%1:08:00:: , led him to the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: to take off his clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: .
He then draped him over the rough stand---stand%1:06:00:: , explained that he was supposed to be recently dead , and was being held on his mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's lap---lap%1:08:00:: .
The model---model%1:18:00:: quite plainly thought Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: crazy ; only the instructions---instruction%1:10:04:: from his rabbi---rabbi%1:18:00:: kept him from bolting .
But at the end---end%1:11:00:: of the sitting---sitting%1:04:01:: , when Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: showed him the quick , free drawings---drawing%1:06:00:: , with the mother---mother%1:18:00:: roughed in , holding her son---son%1:18:00:: , the model---model%1:18:00:: grasped what Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: was after , and promised to speak to his friends---friend%1:18:00:: .
He worked for two hours---hour%1:28:00:: a day---day%1:28:00:: with each model---model%1:18:00:: sent by the rabbi---rabbi%1:18:00:: .
Mary---person%1:03:00:: presented quite a different problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
Though this sculpture---sculpture%1:06:00:: must take place thirty-three years---years%1:28:00:: after her moment---moment%1:28:00:: of decision---decision%1:04:00:: , he could not conceive of her as a woman---woman%1:18:00:: in her mid-fifties---mid-fifties%1:28:00:: , old , wrinkled , broken in body---body%1:08:00:: and face---face%1:08:00:: by labor---labor%1:04:00:: or worry---worry%1:12:00:: .
His image---image%1:09:00:: of the Virgin---the_virgin%1:18:00:: had always been that of a young woman---young_woman%1:18:00:: , even as had his memory---memory%1:09:01:: of his mother---mother%1:18:00:: .
Jacopo Galli---person%1:03:00:: introduced him into several Roman homes---home%1:06:00:: .
Here he sketched , sitting in their flowing gowns---gown%1:06:00:: of linen---linen%1:06:01:: and silk---silk%1:06:00:: , young girls---young_girl%1:18:00:: not yet twenty , some about to be married , some married a year---year%1:28:01:: or two .
Since the Santo Spirito hospital---group%1:03:00:: had taken only men---man%1:18:00:: , he had had no experience---experience%1:09:00:: in the study---study%1:09:02:: of female anatomy---anatomy%1:09:00:: ; but he had sketched the women---woman%1:18:00:: of Tuscany---location%1:03:00:: in their fields---field%1:15:00:: and homes---home%1:06:00:: .
He was able to discern the body---body%1:08:00:: lines---line%1:25:00:: of the Roman women---woman%1:18:00:: under their robes---robe%1:06:00:: .
He spent concentrated weeks---week%1:28:00:: putting his two figures---figure%1:06:00:: together : a Mary---person%1:03:00:: who would be young and sensitive , yet strong enough to hold her son---son%1:18:00:: on her lap---lap%1:08:00:: ; and a Jesus---jesus%1:18:00:: who , though lean , was strong even in death---death%1:26:00:: - a look---look%1:07:00:: he remembered well from his experience---experience%1:09:00:: in the dead room---dead_room%1:06:00:: of Santo Spirito---group%1:03:00:: .
He drew toward the composite design---design%1:06:01:: from his meticulously accurate memory---memory%1:09:01:: , without need---need%1:26:00:: to consult his sketches---sketch%1:06:00:: .
Soon he was ready to go into a three-dimensional figure---three-dimensional_figure%1:25:00:: in clay---clay%1:27:00:: .
Here he would have free expression---expression%1:10:01:: because the material---material%1:27:00:: could be moved to distort forms---form%1:07:01:: .
When he wanted to emphasize , or get greater intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: , he added or subtracted clay---clay%1:27:00:: .
Next he turned to wax---wax%1:27:00:: because there was a similarity---similarity%1:07:00:: of wax---wax%1:27:00:: to marble---marble%1:27:00:: in tactile quality---quality%1:09:00:: and translucence---translucence%1:07:00:: .
He respected each of these approach---approach%1:04:02:: techniques---technique%1:09:01:: , and kept them in character---character%1:09:00:: :
his quill---quill%1:06:00:: drawings---drawing%1:10:00:: had a scratchiness---scratchiness%1:07:00:: , suggesting skin---skin%1:08:00:: texture---texture%1:07:00:: ; the clay---clay%1:27:00:: he used plastically to suggest soft moving flesh---flesh%1:08:02:: , as in an abdomen---abdomen%1:08:00:: , in a reclining torso---torso%1:08:00:: ; the wax---wax%1:27:00:: he smoothed over to give the body---body%1:08:00:: surface---surface%1:06:00:: an elastic pull---pull%1:19:00:: .
Yet he never allowed these models---model%1:06:00:: to become fixed in his mind---mind%1:09:00:: ; they remained rough starting points---starting_point%1:28:00:: .
When carving he was charged with spontaneous energy---energy%1:07:02:: ; too careful or detailed studies---study%1:06:01:: in clay---clay%1:27:00:: and wax---wax%1:27:00:: would have glued him down to a mere enlarging of his model---model%1:06:00:: .
The true surge---surge%1:11:00:: had to be inside the marble---marble%1:27:00:: itself .
Drawing---drawing%1:10:00:: and models---model%1:06:00:: were his thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: .
Carving was action---action%1:04:02:: .
The arrangement---arrangement%1:09:01:: with Argiento---person%1:03:00:: was working well , except that sometimes Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: could not figure who was master---master%1:18:03:: and who apprentice---apprentice%1:18:00:: .
Argiento---person%1:03:00:: had been trained so rigorously by the Jesuits---jesuit%1:18:00:: that Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: was unable to change his habits---habit%1:04:02:: : up before dawn---dawn%1:28:00:: to scrub the floors---floor%1:06:00:: , whether they were dirty or not ; water---water%1:27:00:: boiling on the fire---fire%1:22:00:: for washing laundry---laundry%1:06:01:: every day , the pots---pot%1:06:00:: scoured with river---river%1:17:00:: sand---sand%1:27:00:: after each meal---meal%1:13:00:: .
`` Argiento---person%1:03:00:: , this is senseless '' , he complained , not liking to work on the wet floors---floor%1:06:00:: , particularly in cold weather---cold_weather%1:19:00:: .
Scrub the studio---studio%1:06:00:: once a week---week%1:28:00:: .
`` No '' , said Argiento---person%1:03:00:: stolidly .
Before dawn---dawn%1:28:00:: .
`` And God---god%1:18:01:: help anyone who tries to unteach you '' !
grumbled Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: ; yet he knew that he had nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to grumble about , for Argiento---person%1:03:00:: made few demands---demand%1:10:00:: on him .
The boy---boy%1:18:00:: was becoming acquainted with the contadini families---family%1:14:02:: that brought produce---produce%1:13:00:: into Rome---location%1:03:00:: .
On Sundays---sunday%1:28:00:: he would walk miles---mile%1:23:01:: into the campagna to visit with them , and in particular to see their horses---horse%1:05:00:: .
The one thing---thing%1:06:01:: he missed from his farm---farm%1:06:00:: in the Po Valley---location%1:03:00:: was the animals---animal%1:03:00:: ; frequently he would take his leave of Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: by announcing :
`` Today---today%1:28:00:: I go see the horses---horse%1:05:00:: '' .
It took a piece---piece%1:11:00:: of bad luck---bad_luck%1:19:00:: to show Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: that the boy---boy%1:18:00:: was devoted to him .
He was crouched over his anvil---anvil%1:06:00:: in the courtyard---courtyard%1:06:00:: getting his chisels---chisel%1:06:00:: into trim---trim%1:26:00:: , when a splinter---splinter%1:17:00:: of steel---steel%1:27:00:: flew into his eye---eye%1:08:00:: and imbedded itself in his pupil---pupil%1:08:00:: .
He stumbled into the house---house%1:06:00:: , eyes---eye%1:08:00:: burning like fire---fire%1:22:00:: .
Argiento---person%1:03:00:: made him lie down on the bed---bed%1:06:00:: , brought a pan---pan%1:06:01:: of hot water---water%1:27:00:: , dipped some clean white linen---linen%1:06:01:: cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: and applied it to extract the splinter---splinter%1:17:00:: .
Though the pain---pain%1:26:00:: was considerable Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: was not too concerned .
He assumed he could blink the splinter---splinter%1:17:00:: out .
Argiento---person%1:03:00:: never left his side---side%1:15:02:: , keeping the water---water%1:27:00:: boiled , applying hot compresses---compress%1:06:00:: throughout the night---night%1:28:00:: .
By the second day---day%1:28:02:: Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: began to worry ; and by the second night---night%1:28:00:: he was in a state---state%1:03:00:: of panic---panic%1:12:00:: : he could see nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: out of the afflicted eye---eye%1:08:00:: .
At dawn---dawn%1:28:00:: Argiento---person%1:03:00:: went to Jacopo Galli---person%1:03:00:: .
Galli---person%1:03:00:: arrived with his family---family%1:14:02:: surgeon---surgeon%1:18:00:: , Maestro Lippi---person%1:03:00:: .
The surgeon---surgeon%1:18:00:: carried a cage---cage%1:06:00:: of live pigeons---pigeon%1:05:00:: .
He told Argiento---person%1:03:00:: to take a bird---bird%1:05:00:: out of the cage---cage%1:06:00:: , cut a large vein---vein%1:08:00:: under its wing---wing%1:06:00:: , let the blood---blood%1:08:00:: gush into Michelangelo---person%1:03:00:: 's injured eye---eye%1:08:00:: .
The surgeon---surgeon%1:18:00:: came back at dusk---dusk%1:28:00:: , cut the vein---vein%1:08:00:: of a second pigeon---pigeon%1:05:00:: , again washed out the eye---eye%1:08:00:: .
An analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of the election---election%1:04:01:: falls naturally in four parts---part%1:24:00:: .
First is the long and still somewhat obscure process---process%1:04:00:: of preparation---preparation%1:04:02:: , planning---planning%1:04:00:: and discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: .
Preparation---preparation%1:04:02:: began slightly more than a year---year%1:28:01:: after independence---independence%1:26:00:: with the first steps---first_step%1:04:00:: to organize rural communes---commune%1:15:00:: .
All political interests---interest%1:14:00:: supported electoral planning---planning%1:09:00:: , although there are some signs---sign%1:10:05:: that the inherent uncertainties---uncertainty%1:09:00:: of a popular judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: led to some procrastination---procrastination%1:04:00:: .
The second major aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: of the election---election%1:04:01:: is the actual procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: of registration---registration%1:04:00:: , nomination---nomination%1:04:00:: and voting---voting%1:04:00:: .
Considerable technical skill---skill%1:09:00:: was used and the administration---administration%1:04:00:: of the elections---election%1:04:01:: was generally above reproach---reproach%1:10:00:: .
However , the regionally differentiated results---result%1:11:00:: , which appear below in tables---table%1:14:00:: , are interesting evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: of the problems---problem%1:26:00:: of developing self-government---self-government%1:26:00:: under even the most favorable circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: .
A third aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: , and probably the one open to most controversy---controversy%1:10:00:: , is the results---result%1:11:00:: of the election---election%1:04:01:: .
The electoral procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: prevented the ready identification---identification%1:04:00:: of party---party%1:14:01:: affiliation---affiliation%1:04:00:: , but all vitally interested parties---party%1:14:01:: , including the government---government%1:14:00:: itself , were busily engaged in determining the party---party%1:14:01:: identifications---identification%1:04:00:: of all successful candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: the month---month%1:28:01:: following the elections---election%1:04:01:: .
The fourth and concluding point---point%1:10:01:: will be to estimate the long-run significance---significance%1:07:00:: of the elections---election%1:04:01:: and how they figure in the current pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: of internal politics---politics%1:24:00:: .
Elections---election%1:04:01:: have figured prominently in nearly every government---government%1:14:00:: program---program%1:10:04:: and official address---address%1:10:00:: since independence---independence%1:26:00:: .
They were stressed in the speeches---speech%1:10:01:: of Si Mubarak Bekkai---person%1:03:00:: when the first Council of Ministers---group%1:03:00:: was formed and again when the Istiqlal took a leading role---role%1:04:00:: in the second Council---group%1:03:00:: .
King Muhammad---person%1:03:00:: /5 , was known to be most sympathetic to the formation---formation%1:04:01:: of local self-government---self-government%1:26:00:: and made the first firm promise---promise%1:10:00:: of elections---election%1:04:01:: on May Day---may_day%1:28:00:: , 1957 .
There followed a long and sometimes bitter discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: of the feasibility---feasibility%1:07:00:: of elections---election%1:04:01:: for the fall---fall%1:28:00:: of 1957 , in which it appears that the Minister of the Interior---person%1:03:00:: took the most pessimistic view---view%1:09:02:: and that the Istiqlal was something less than enthusiastic .
Since the complicated process---process%1:04:00:: of establishing new communes---commune%1:15:00:: and reviewing the rudimentary plan---plan%1:09:01:: left by the French did not even begin until the fall---fall%1:28:00:: of 1957 , this goal---goal%1:09:00:: appears somewhat ambitious .
From the very beginning---beginning%1:28:00:: the electoral discussions---discussion%1:10:02:: raised fundamental issues---issue%1:09:01:: in Moroccan politics---politics%1:24:00:: , precisely the type---type%1:09:00:: of questions---question%1:10:01:: that were most difficult to resolve in the new government---government%1:14:00:: .
Until the Charter of Liberties was issued in the fall---fall%1:28:00:: of 1958 , there were no guarantees---guarantee%1:10:00:: of the right---right%1:07:00:: to assemble or to organize for political purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: .
The Istiqlal was still firmly united in 1957 , but the P.D.I.---group%1:03:00:: ( Parti Democratique de l'Independance---group%1:03:00:: ) , the most important minor party---party%1:14:01:: at the time---time%1:28:00:: , objected to the Istiqlal 's predominance---predominance%1:26:00:: in the civil service---civil_service%1:14:00:: and influence---influence%1:07:00:: in Radio Maroc .
There were rumors---rumor%1:10:00:: that the Ministry of the Interior---group%1:03:00:: favored an arbitrary , `` non-political '' process---process%1:04:00:: , which were indirectly affirmed when the King---king%1:18:00:: personally intervened in the planned meetings---meeting%1:14:00:: .
The day---day%1:28:01:: following his intervention---intervention%1:04:00:: the palace---palace%1:14:00:: issued a statement---statement%1:10:00:: reassuring the citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: that `` the possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: of introducing appeals---appeal%1:10:00:: concerning the establishment---establishment%1:04:00:: of electoral lists---list%1:10:00:: , lists---list%1:10:00:: of candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: and finally the holding---holding%1:04:00:: of the consultation---consultation%1:10:00:: itself '' would be supported by the King---king%1:18:00:: himself .
The Ifni crisis---crisis%1:11:00:: in the fall---fall%1:28:00:: of 1957 postponed further consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: of elections---election%1:04:01:: , but French---french%1:18:00:: consultants---consultant%1:18:00:: were called in and notices---notice%1:10:00:: of further investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: appeared from time to time .
In January---january%1:28:00:: , 1958 , the Minister of the Interior---person%1:03:00:: announced that an election---election%1:04:01:: law---law%1:10:00:: was ready to be submitted to the King---king%1:18:00:: , the rumors---rumor%1:10:00:: of election---election%1:04:01:: dates---date%1:28:00:: appeared once again , first for spring---spring%1:28:00:: of 1958 and later for the summer---summer%1:28:00:: .
Although the government---government%1:14:00:: was probably prepared for elections---election%1:04:01:: by mid - 1958 , the first decision---decision%1:04:00:: was no doubt made more difficult as party---party%1:14:01:: strife---strife%1:26:00:: multiplied .
In late 1957 the M.P. ( Mouvement Populaire ) appeared and in the spring---spring%1:28:00:: of 1958 the internal strains---strain%1:19:00:: of the Istiqlal was revealed when the third Council of Government---group%1:03:00:: under Balafrej---person%1:03:00:: was formed without support---support%1:04:04:: from progressive elements---element%1:15:00:: in the party---party%1:14:01:: .
The parties---party%1:14:01:: were on the whole unprepared for elections---election%1:04:01:: , while the people---people%1:14:00:: were still experiencing post independence---independence%1:26:00:: let-down---letdown%1:12:00:: and suffering the after effects---aftereffect%1:19:00:: of poor harvests---harvest%1:20:00:: in 1957 .
Despite the internal and international crises---crisis%1:11:00:: that harassed Morocco---morocco%1:15:00:: the elections---election%1:04:01:: remained a central issue---issue%1:09:01:: .
They figured prominently in the Balafrej---person%1:03:00:: government---government%1:14:00:: of May---may%1:28:00:: , 1958 , which the King---king%1:18:00:: was reportedly determined to keep in office---office%1:04:01:: until elections---election%1:04:01:: could be held .
But the eagerly sought `` homogeneity---homogeneity%1:07:00:: '' of the Balafrej---location%1:03:00:: Council of Government---group%1:03:00:: was never achieved as the Istiqlal quarreled over foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: , labor---labor%1:14:00:: politics---politics%1:24:00:: and economic development---development%1:04:01:: .
By December---december%1:28:00:: , 1958 , when ' Abdallah Ibrahim---person%1:03:00:: became President of the Council---person%1:03:00:: , elections---election%1:04:01:: had even greater importance---importance%1:07:00:: .
They were increasingly looked upon as a means---means%1:04:00:: of establishing the new rural communes---commune%1:15:00:: as the focus---focus%1:09:00:: of a new , constructive national effort---effort%1:04:00:: .
To minimize the chances---chance%1:04:00:: of repeating the Balafrej---person%1:03:00:: debacle---debacle%1:11:02:: the Ibrahim---person%1:03:00:: government---government%1:14:00:: was formed a titer personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: and a special office---office%1:04:01:: was created in the Ministry of the Interior---group%1:03:00:: to plan and to conduct the elections---election%1:04:01:: .
By this time---time%1:11:00:: there is little doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: but what election---election%1:04:01:: plans---plan%1:09:00:: were complete .
There remained only the delicate task---task%1:04:00:: of maneuvering the laws---law%1:10:00:: through the labyrinth---labyrinth%1:06:00:: of Palace---palace%1:14:00:: politics---politics%1:24:00:: and making a small number---number%1:23:00:: of policy---policy%1:09:00:: decisions---decision%1:04:00:: .
From the rather tortuous history---history%1:28:00:: of electoral planning---planning%1:09:00:: in Morocco---morocco%1:15:00:: an important point---point%1:10:01:: emerges concerning the first elections---election%1:04:01:: in a developing country---country%1:14:00:: and evaluating their results---result%1:11:00:: .
In the new country---country%1:14:00:: the electoral process---process%1:04:00:: is considered as a means---means%1:04:00:: of resolving fundamental , and sometimes bitter , differences---difference%1:10:00:: among leaders---leaders%1:14:00:: and also as a source---source%1:09:00:: of policy---policy%1:09:00:: guidance---guidance%1:04:01:: .
In the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of a reservoir---reservoir%1:23:00:: of political consensus---consensus%1:26:00:: each organized political group---group%1:03:00:: hopes that the elections---election%1:04:01:: will give them new prominence---prominence%1:26:00:: , but in a system---system%1:14:00:: where there is as yet no place---place%1:09:00:: for the less prominent .
Lacking the respected and effective institutions---institution%1:14:00:: that consensus---consensus%1:26:00:: helps provide , minority---minority%1:14:00:: parties---party%1:14:01:: , such as the P.D.I. in 1957 and the progressive Istiqlal faction---faction%1:14:01:: in 1958 , clamor for elections---election%1:04:01:: when out of power---power%1:26:00:: , but are not at all certain they wish to be controlled by popular choice---choice%1:09:00:: when in power---power%1:26:00:: .
Those in power---power%1:26:00:: tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process---process%1:04:00:: .
The tendency---tendency%1:12:00:: to treat elections---election%1:04:01:: as an instrument---instrument%1:04:00:: of self-interest---self-interest%1:07:01:: rather than an instrument---instrument%1:04:00:: of national interest---interest%1:07:01:: had two important effects---effect%1:19:00:: on electoral planning---planning%1:09:00:: in Morocco---morocco%1:15:00:: .
At the central level---level%1:26:01:: the scrutin uninominal voting system---scrutin_uninominal_voting_system%1:09:00:: was selected over some form---form%1:09:01:: of the scrutin de liste system---scrutin_de_liste_system%1:09:00:: , even though the latter had been recommended by Duverger---person%1:03:00:: and favored by all political parties---political_party%1:14:00:: .
The choice---choice%1:09:00:: of the single member---member%1:24:00:: district---district%1:15:00:: was dictated to a certain extent---extent%1:07:00:: by problems---problem%1:26:00:: of communication---communication%1:10:01:: and understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: in the more remote areas---area%1:15:01:: of the country---country%1:15:00:: , but it also served to minimize the national political value---value%1:07:00:: of the elections---election%1:04:01:: .
Although the elections---election%1:04:01:: were for local officials---official%1:18:01:: , it was not necessary to conduct the elections---election%1:04:01:: so as to prevent parties---party%1:14:01:: from publicly identifying their candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: .
With multiple member---member%1:24:00:: districts---district%1:15:00:: the still fragmentary local party---party%1:14:01:: organizations---organization%1:14:01:: could have operated more effectively and parties---party%1:14:01:: might have been encouraged to state their positions---position%1:09:00:: more clearly .
Both parties---party%1:14:01:: and the Ministry of the Interior---group%1:03:00:: were busily at work after the elections---election%1:04:01:: trying to unearth the political affiliations---affiliation%1:26:00:: of the successful candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: and , thereby , give the elections---election%1:04:01:: a confidential but known degree---degree%1:07:00:: of national political significance---significance%1:07:00:: .
Since a national interpretation---interpretation%1:09:01:: cannot be avoided it is unfortunate that the elections---election%1:04:01:: were not held in a way---way%1:07:01:: to maximize party---party%1:14:01:: responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: and the educational effect---effect%1:19:00:: of mass political participation---participation%1:04:00:: .
The general setting---setting%1:26:00:: of the Moroccan election---election%1:04:01:: may also encourage the deterioration---deterioration%1:26:00:: of local party---party%1:14:01:: organization---organization%1:14:01:: .
The concentration---concentration%1:11:00:: of effective power---power%1:07:00:: in Rabat---rabat%1:15:00:: leads not only to party---party%1:14:01:: bickering---bickering%1:10:00:: , but to distraction---distraction%1:09:00:: from local activity---activity%1:04:00:: that might have had many auxiliary benefits---benefit%1:07:00:: in addition to contributing to more meaningful elections---election%1:04:01:: .
Interesting evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: can be found in the results---result%1:11:00:: of the Chamber of Commerce---chamber_of_commerce%1:14:00:: elections---election%1:04:01:: , which took place three weeks---week%1:28:00:: before national elections---election%1:04:01:: .
The Istiqlal sponsored U.M.C.I.A.---group%1:03:00:: ( L'Union Marocaine des Commercants---group%1:03:00:: , Industrialistes et Artisans---group%1:03:00:: ) was opposed by candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: of the new U.N.F.P.---group%1:03:00:: ( L'Union National des Forces Populaires---group%1:03:00:: ) in nearly all urban centers---urban_center%1:15:00:: .
As the more conservative group---group%1:03:00:: with strong backing---backing%1:04:00:: from wealthy businessmen---businessmen%1:14:00:: , the U.M.C.I.A.---group%1:03:00:: was generally favored against the more progressive , labor---labor%1:14:00:: based U.N.F.P.---group%1:03:00:: The newer party---party%1:14:01:: campaigned heavily , while the older , more confident party---party%1:14:01:: expected the Moroccan merchants---merchant%1:18:00:: and small businessmen---small_businessman%1:18:00:: to support them as they had done for many years---year%1:28:01:: .
The local Istiqlal and U.M.C.I.A.---group%1:03:00:: offices---office%1:14:01:: did not campaign and lost heavily .
The value---value%1:07:00:: of the elections---election%1:04:01:: was lost , both as an experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: in increased political participation---participation%1:04:00:: and as a reliable indicator---indicator%1:10:01:: of commercial interest---interest%1:07:01:: , as shown in Table---table%1:14:00:: /1 , .
The chamber of Commerce---group%1:03:00:: elections---election%1:04:01:: were , of course , an important event---event%1:03:00:: in the preparation---preparation%1:04:02:: for rural commune---commune%1:15:00:: elections---election%1:04:01:: .
The U.N.F.P.---group%1:03:00:: learned that its urban organization---organization%1:14:00:: , which depends heavily on U.M.T.---group%1:03:00:: support---support%1:04:04:: , was most effective .
The Istiqlal found that the spontaneous solidarity---solidarity%1:07:00:: of the independence---independence%1:26:00:: struggle---struggle%1:04:00:: was not easily transposed to the more concrete , precise problems---problem%1:26:00:: of internal politics---politics%1:24:00:: .
The overall effect---effect%1:19:00:: was probably to stimulate more party---party%1:14:01:: activity---activity%1:04:00:: in the communal elections---election%1:04:01:: than might have otherwise taken place .
A second major point---point%1:10:01:: of this essay---essay%1:10:00:: is to examine the formal arrangements---arrangement%1:09:00:: for the elections---election%1:04:01:: .
Although a somewhat technical subject---subject%1:10:00:: , it has important political implications---implication%1:09:01:: as the above discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: of the voting system---voting_system%1:09:00:: indicated .
Furthermore , the problems---problem%1:10:00:: and solutions---solution%1:10:00:: devised in the electoral experiences---experience%1:11:00:: of the rapidly changing countries---country%1:14:00:: are often of comparative value---value%1:07:00:: and essential to evaluating election---election%1:04:01:: results---result%1:11:00:: .
The sine qua non---sine_qua_non%1:09:00:: of the elections---election%1:04:01:: was naturally an impartial and standardized procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: .
As the background---background%1:09:01:: discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: indicated there were frequently expressed doubts---doubt%1:09:00:: that a government---government%1:14:00:: dominated by either party---party%1:14:01:: could fairly administer elections---election%1:04:01:: .
The P.D.I. and later the Popular Movement protected the Istiqlal 's `` privileged position---position%1:04:01:: '' until the fall---fall%1:04:02:: of Balafrej---person%1:03:00:: , and then the Istiqlal used the same argument---argument%1:10:02:: , which it had previously ignored , against the pro U.N.F.P.---group%1:03:00:: tendencies---tendency%1:12:00:: of the Ibrahim---person%1:03:00:: government---government%1:14:00:: .
The bulk---bulk%1:07:02:: of the preparation---preparation%1:04:02:: had , of course , proceeded under the supervision---supervision%1:04:00:: of the Ministry of the Interior---group%1:03:00:: , whose officials---official%1:18:01:: are barred from party---party%1:14:01:: activity---activity%1:04:00:: and probably generally disinterested in party---party%1:14:01:: politics---politics%1:24:00:: .
Apart from some areas---area%1:15:01:: of recurring trouble---trouble%1:11:00:: , like Bani Mellal---location%1:03:00:: , where inexperienced officials---official%1:18:01:: had been appointed , there is little evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that local officials---official%1:18:01:: intervened in the electoral process---process%1:04:00:: .
Centrally , however , the administrative problem---problem%1:10:00:: was more complex and the sheer prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: of office---office%1:04:01:: was very likely an unfair advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: .
The King---king%1:18:00:: decided to remove Ibrahim---person%1:03:00:: a week---week%1:28:00:: before elections---election%1:04:01:: and to institute a non-party Council of Government---group%1:03:00:: under his personal direction---direction%1:04:01:: .
Although the monarch---monarch%1:18:00:: had frequently asserted that the elections---election%1:04:01:: were to be without party---party%1:14:01:: significance---significance%1:07:00:: , his action---action%1:04:02:: was an implicit admission---admission%1:10:00:: that party---party%1:14:01:: identifications---identification%1:04:00:: were a factor---factor%1:11:00:: .
The new Council---council%1:14:01:: was itself inescapably of political meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: , which was most clearly revealed in the absence---absence%1:04:00:: of any U.N.F.P.---group%1:03:00:: members---member%1:18:00:: and the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of several Istiqlal leaders---leaders%1:14:00:: .
Since the details---detail%1:09:00:: of the elections---election%1:04:01:: were settled the change---change%1:04:00:: of government---government%1:14:00:: had no direct effect---effect%1:19:00:: on the technical aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: of the elections---election%1:04:01:: , and may have been more important as an indication---indication%1:10:00:: of royal displeasure---displeasure%1:12:00:: with the U.N.F.P.
Voting---voting%1:04:00:: preparations---preparation%1:04:02:: began in the fall---fall%1:28:00:: of 1959 , although the actual demarcation---demarcation%1:15:00:: and planning---planning%1:04:00:: for the rural communes---commune%1:15:00:: was completed in 1958 .
There were three major administrative tasks---task%1:04:00:: : the fixing---fixing%1:04:00:: of electoral districts---district%1:15:00:: , the registration---registration%1:04:00:: of voters---voter%1:18:00:: and the registration---registration%1:04:00:: of candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: .
Voter---voter%1:18:00:: registration---registration%1:04:00:: began in late November---november%1:28:00:: 1959 and continued until early January---january%1:28:00:: , 1960 .
The government---government%1:14:00:: was most anxious that there be a respectable response---response%1:19:00:: .
Periodic bulletins---bulletin%1:10:00:: of the accomplishment---accomplishment%1:04:00:: in each province---province%1:15:00:: made the registration---registration%1:04:00:: process---process%1:04:00:: into a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of competition---competition%1:11:00:: among provincial officials---official%1:18:01:: .
A goal---goal%1:09:00:: was fixed , as given in Table---table%1:14:00:: 2---2%1:23:00:: , and attention---attention%1:09:00:: focused on its fulfillment---fulfillment%1:04:00:: .
The qualifications---qualification%1:07:00:: to vote were kept very simple .
Both men---man%1:18:00:: and women---woman%1:18:00:: of twenty-one years---years%1:28:00:: of age could register and vote upon presenting proof---proof%1:10:00:: of residence---residence%1:15:00:: and identification---identification%1:10:01:: .
There were liberal provisions---provision%1:10:00:: for dispensation---dispensation%1:04:01:: where documents---document%1:10:00:: or records---record%1:21:00:: were lacking .
The police---police%1:14:00:: were disqualified along with certain categories---category%1:14:00:: of naturalized citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: , criminals---criminal%1:18:00:: and those punished for Protectorate---protectorate%1:15:00:: activities---activity%1:04:00:: .
The registration---registration%1:04:00:: figures---figure%1:23:00:: given in Table---table%1:14:00:: 2---2%1:23:00:: must be interpreted with caution---caution%1:09:00:: since the estimate---estimate%1:10:01:: for eligible electors---elector%1:18:00:: were made without the benefit---benefit%1:07:00:: of a reliable census---census%1:04:00:: .
Burly leathered men---man%1:18:00:: and wrinkled women---woman%1:18:00:: in drab black rags---rag%1:06:00:: carried on in a primitive way---way%1:04:00:: , almost unchanged from feudal times---times%1:28:01:: .
Peasants---peasant%1:18:00:: puzzled Andrei---person%1:03:00:: .
He wondered how they could go on in poverty---poverty%1:26:00:: , superstition---superstition%1:09:00:: , ignorance---ignorance%1:09:00:: , with a complete lack---lack%1:26:00:: of desire---desire%1:12:00:: to make either their land---land%1:21:01:: or their lives---life%1:26:01:: flourish .
Andrei---person%1:03:00:: remembered a Bathyran meeting---meeting%1:14:01:: long ago .
Tolek Alterman---person%1:03:00:: had returned from the colonies---colony%1:14:00:: in Palestine---location%1:03:00:: and , before the national leadership---leadership%1:14:00:: , exalted the miracles---miracle%1:11:00:: of drying up swamps---swamp%1:17:00:: and irrigating the desert---desert%1:15:00:: .
A fund-raising drive---fund-raising_drive%1:04:00:: to buy tractors---tractor%1:06:00:: and machinery---machinery%1:06:00:: was launched .
Andrei---person%1:03:00:: remembered that his own reaction---reaction%1:04:00:: had been one of indifference---indifference%1:12:00:: .
Had he found the meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: too late ?
The land---land%1:17:01:: of the Lublin Uplands---location%1:03:00:: was rich , but no one seemed to care .
In the unfertile land---land%1:17:01:: in Palestine---location%1:03:00:: humans broke their backs pushing will power---willpower%1:07:00:: to the brink---brink%1:25:00:: .
He had sat beside Alexander Brandel---person%1:03:00:: at the rostrum---rostrum%1:06:00:: of a congress---congress%1:14:00:: of Zionists---zionist%1:18:00:: .
All of them were there in this loosely knit association---association%1:14:00:: of diversified ideologies---ideology%1:09:01:: , and each berated the other and beat his breast---breast%1:08:01:: for his own approaches---approach%1:04:02:: .
When Alexander Brandel---person%1:03:00:: rose to speak , the hall---hall%1:06:02:: became silent .
`` I do not care if your beliefs---belief%1:09:00:: take you along a path---path%1:04:00:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: or a path---path%1:04:00:: of labor---labor%1:04:00:: or a path---path%1:04:00:: of activism---activism%1:09:00:: .
We are here because all our paths---path%1:04:00:: travel a blind course---course%1:15:00:: through a thick forest---forest%1:14:00:: , seeking human dignity---dignity%1:07:00:: .
Beyond the forest---forest%1:14:00:: all our paths---path%1:04:00:: merge into a single great highway---highway%1:06:00:: which ends in the barren , eroded hills of Judea---location%1:03:00:: .
This is our singular goal---goal%1:09:00:: .
How we travel through the forest---forest%1:14:00:: is for each man---man%1:18:00:: 's conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: .
Where we end our journey---journey%1:04:00:: is always the same .
We all seek the same thing---thing%1:26:00:: through different ways---way%1:04:01:: - an end---end%1:28:00:: to this long night---night%1:28:00:: of two thousand years---years%1:28:00:: of darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: and unspeakable abuses---abuse%1:04:02:: which will continue to plague us until the Star of David---star_of_david%1:10:00:: flies over Zion---location%1:03:00:: '' .
This was how Alexander Brandel---person%1:03:00:: expressed pure Zionism---zionism%1:10:00:: .
It had sounded good to Andrei---person%1:03:00:: , but he did not believe it .
In his heart---heart%1:09:00:: he had no desire---desire%1:12:00:: to go to Palestine---palestine%1:15:01:: .
He loathed the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of drying up swamps---swamp%1:17:00:: or the chills---chill%1:26:01:: of malaria---malaria%1:26:00:: or of leaving---leaving%1:04:00:: his natural birthright---birthright%1:07:00:: .
Before he went into battle---battle%1:04:00:: Andrei---person%1:03:00:: had told Alex---person%1:03:00:: , `` I only want to be a Pole---pole%1:18:00:: .
Warsaw---warsaw%1:15:00:: is my city---city%1:15:00:: , not Tel Aviv---tel_aviv%1:15:00:: '' .
And now Andrei---person%1:03:00:: sat on a train---train%1:06:00:: on the way to Lublin---location%1:03:00:: and wondered if he was not being punished for his lack---lack%1:26:00:: of belief---belief%1:09:00:: .
Warsaw---warsaw%1:15:00:: !
He saw the smug eyes---eye%1:08:00:: of the Home Army---group%1:03:00:: chief---chief%1:18:00:: , Roman---roman%1:18:00:: , and all the Romans---roman%1:18:00:: and the faces---face%1:08:00:: of the peasants---peasant%1:18:00:: who held only hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: for him .
They had let this black hole---black_hole%1:17:00:: of death---death%1:26:00:: in Warsaw---warsaw%1:15:00:: 's heart---heart%1:15:00:: exist without a cry---cry%1:10:04:: of protest---protest%1:10:00:: .
Once there had been big glittering rooms---room%1:06:00:: where Ulanys---person%1:03:00:: bowed and kissed the ladies---lady%1:18:01:: ' hands---hand%1:08:00:: as they flirted from behind their fans---fan%1:06:00:: .
Warsaw---warsaw%1:15:00:: !
Warsaw---warsaw%1:15:00:: !
`` Miss Rak---person%1:03:00:: .
I am a Jew---jew%1:18:00:: '' .
Day by day , week by week , month by month , the betrayal---betrayal%1:04:00:: gnawed at Andrei---person%1:03:00:: 's heart---heart%1:09:00:: .
He ground his teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: together .
I hate Warsaw---warsaw%1:15:00:: , he said to himself .
I hate Poland---poland%1:15:00:: and all the goddamned mothers---mother%1:18:00:: ' sons---son%1:18:00:: of them .
All of Poland---poland%1:15:00:: is a coffin---coffin%1:06:00:: .
The terrible vision---vision%1:09:03:: of the ghetto---ghetto%1:15:00:: streets---street%1:06:00:: flooded his mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
What is beyond this fog---fog%1:26:01:: ?
Only Palestine---palestine%1:15:01:: , and I will never live to see Palestine---palestine%1:15:01:: because I did not believe .
By late afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: the train---train%1:06:00:: inched into the marshaling yards---yard%1:15:00:: in the railhead---railhead%1:06:00:: at Lublin---location%1:03:00:: , which was filled with lines---line%1:14:01:: of cars---car%1:06:01:: poised to pour the tools---tool%1:06:00:: of war---war%1:04:00:: to the Russian front---front%1:15:01:: .
At a siding---siding%1:06:01:: , another train---train%1:06:00:: which was a familiar sight---sight%1:09:01:: these days---day%1:28:03:: .
Deportees---deportee%1:18:00:: .
Jews---jew%1:18:00:: .
Andrei---person%1:03:00:: 's skilled eye---eye%1:08:00:: sized them up .
They were not Poles---pole%1:18:00:: .
He guessed by their appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: that they were Rumanians---rumanian%1:10:00:: .
He walked toward the center---center%1:15:01:: of the city---city%1:15:00:: to keep his rendezvous---rendezvous%1:04:00:: with Styka---person%1:03:00:: .
Of all the places---place%1:15:01:: in Poland---poland%1:15:00:: , Andrei---person%1:03:00:: hated Lublin---location%1:03:00:: the most .
Few of the native Jews---jew%1:18:00:: who had lived in Lublin---location%1:03:00:: were still in the ghetto---ghetto%1:15:00:: .
From the moment---moment%1:28:00:: of the occupation---occupation%1:04:01:: Lublin---location%1:03:00:: became a focal point---focal_point%1:19:00:: .
He and Ana---person%1:03:00:: watched it carefully .
Lublin---location%1:03:00:: generally was the forerunner---forerunner%1:10:00:: of what would happen elsewhere .
Early in 1939 , Odilo Globocnik---person%1:03:00:: , the Gauleiter---person%1:03:00:: of Vienna---vienna%1:15:00:: , established SS headquarters---headquarters%1:14:00:: for all of Poland---poland%1:15:00:: .
The Bathyrans ran a check---check%1:09:01:: on Globocnik---person%1:03:00:: and had only to conclude that he was in a tug of war---tug-of-war%1:04:00:: with Hans Frank---person%1:03:00:: and the civilian administrators---administrator%1:18:00:: .
Globocnik---person%1:03:00:: built the Death's-Head Corps---group%1:03:00:: .
Lublin---location%1:03:00:: was the seed of action---action%1:26:00:: for the `` final solution---solution%1:10:00:: '' of the Jewish problem---problem%1:10:00:: .
As the messages---message%1:10:00:: from Himmler---person%1:03:00:: , Heydrich---person%1:03:00:: , and Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: came in through Alfred Funk---person%1:03:00:: , Lublin---location%1:03:00:: 's fountainhead---fountainhead%1:10:00:: spouted .
A bevy---bevy%1:14:01:: of interlacing lagers---lager%1:06:00:: , work camps---work_camp%1:06:00:: , concentration camps---concentration_camp%1:06:00:: erupted in the area---area%1:15:01:: .
Sixty thousand Jewish prisoners of war---prisoner_of_war%1:18:00:: disappeared into Lublin---location%1:03:00:: 's web---web%1:06:00:: .
Plans---plan%1:09:00:: went in and out of Lublin---location%1:03:00:: , indicating German confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: .
A tale---tale%1:10:00:: of a massive reservation---reservation%1:15:00:: in the Uplands---location%1:03:00:: to hold several million Jews---jew%1:18:00:: .
A tale---tale%1:10:00:: of a plan---plan%1:09:00:: to ship all Jews---jew%1:18:00:: to the island---island%1:17:00:: of Madagascar---location%1:03:00:: .
Stories---story%1:10:03:: of the depravity---depravity%1:07:00:: of the guards---guard%1:18:03:: at Globocnik---location%1:03:00:: 's camps---concentration_camp%1:06:00:: struck a chord of terror---terror%1:12:00:: at the mere mention---mention%1:10:01:: of their names---name%1:10:00:: .
Lipowa 7---location%1:03:00:: , Sobibor---location%1:03:00:: , Chelmno---location%1:03:00:: , Poltawa---location%1:03:00:: , Belzec---location%1:03:00:: , Krzywy-Rog---location%1:03:00:: , Budzyn---location%1:03:00:: , Krasnik---location%1:03:00:: .
Ice---ice%1:27:00:: baths---bath%1:04:00:: , electric shocks---electric_shock%1:04:01:: , lashings---lashing%1:04:00:: , wild dogs---wild_dog%1:05:00:: , testicle---testicle%1:08:00:: crushers---crusher%1:06:00:: .
The Death's-Head Corps---group%1:03:00:: took in Ukrainian---ukrainian%1:10:00:: and Baltic Auxiliaries---group%1:03:00:: , and the Einsatzkommandos waded knee-deep in blood---blood%1:08:00:: and turned into drunken , dope---dope%1:06:00:: ridden maniacs---maniac%1:18:00:: .
Lublin---location%1:03:00:: was their heart---heart%1:07:01:: .
In the spring---spring%1:28:00:: of 1942 Operation Reinhard began in Lublin---location%1:03:00:: .
The ghetto---ghetto%1:15:00:: , a miniature---miniature%1:06:01:: of Warsaw---location%1:03:00:: 's , was emptied into the camp---concentration_camp%1:06:00:: in the Majdan-Tartarski---location%1:03:00:: suburb---suburb%1:15:00:: called Majdanek---location%1:03:00:: .
As the camp---concentration_camp%1:06:00:: emptied , it was refilled by a draining---drain%1:04:00:: of the camps---concentration_camp%1:06:00:: and towns---town%1:15:00:: around Lublin---location%1:03:00:: , then by deportees---deportee%1:18:00:: from outside Poland---poland%1:15:00:: .
In and in and in they poured through the gates---gate%1:06:00:: of Majdanek---location%1:03:00:: , but they never left , and Majdanek---location%1:03:00:: was not growing any larger .
What was happening in Majdanek---location%1:03:00:: ?
Was Operation Reinhard the same pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: for the daily trains---train%1:06:00:: now leaving the Umschlagplatz---location%1:03:00:: in Warsaw---warsaw%1:15:00:: ?
Was there another Majdanek---location%1:03:00:: in the Warsaw---warsaw%1:15:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: , as they suspected ?
Andrei---person%1:03:00:: stopped at Litowski Place---location%1:03:00:: and looked around quickly at the boundary---boundary%1:15:00:: of civil buildings---building%1:06:00:: .
His watch---watch%1:06:00:: told him he was still early .
Down the boulevard---boulevard%1:06:00:: he could see a portion---portion%1:24:00:: of the ghetto---ghetto%1:15:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
He found an empty bench---bench%1:06:00:: , opened a newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: , and stretched his legs---leg%1:08:01:: before him .
Krakow Boulevard---location%1:03:00:: was filled with black Nazi---nazi%1:18:00:: uniforms---uniform%1:06:00:: and the dirty brownish ones of their Auxiliaries---group%1:03:00:: .
`` Captain Androfski---person%1:03:00:: '' !
Andrei---person%1:03:00:: glanced up over the top---top%1:15:01:: of the paper---paper%1:27:00:: and looked into the mustached , homely face---face%1:08:00:: of Sergeant Styka---person%1:03:00:: .
Styka---person%1:03:00:: sat beside him and pumped his hand---hand%1:08:00:: excitedly .
`` I have been waiting across the street---street%1:06:00:: at the post office---post_office%1:14:01:: since dawn---dawn%1:28:00:: .
I thought you might get in on a morning train---train%1:06:00:: '' .
`` It 's good to see you again , Styka---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Styka---person%1:03:00:: studied his captain---captain%1:18:05:: .
He almost broke into tears---tears%1:04:00:: .
To him , Andrei Androfski---person%1:03:00:: had always been the living symbol---symbol%1:10:00:: of a Polish officer---officer%1:18:03:: .
His captain---captain%1:18:05:: was thin and haggard and his beautiful boots---boot%1:06:00:: were worn and shabby .
`` Remember to call me Jan---person%1:03:00:: '' , Andrei---person%1:03:00:: said .
Styka---person%1:03:00:: nodded and sniffed and blew his nose---nose%1:08:00:: vociferously .
`` When that woman---woman%1:18:00:: found me and told me that you needed me I was never so happy since before the war---war%1:04:00:: '' .
`` I'm lucky that you were still living in Lublin---location%1:03:00:: '' .
Styka---person%1:03:00:: grumbled about fate---fate%1:11:00:: .
`` For a time---time%1:28:05:: I thought of trying to reach the Free Polish Forces---group%1:03:00:: , but one thing---thing%1:11:00:: led to another .
I got a girl---girl%1:18:01:: in trouble and we had to get married .
Not a bad girl---girl%1:18:01:: .
So we have three children---child%1:18:01:: and responsibilities---responsibility%1:04:00:: .
I work at the granary---granary%1:06:00:: .
Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: like the old days---day%1:28:03:: in the army---army%1:14:00:: , but I get by .
Many times---time%1:11:00:: I tried to reach you , but I never knew how .
I came to Warsaw---location%1:03:00:: twice , but there was that damned ghetto---ghetto%1:15:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: '' .
Styka---person%1:03:00:: blew his nose---nose%1:08:00:: again .
`` Were you able to make the arrangements---arrangement%1:09:01:: '' ?
Andrei---person%1:03:00:: asked .
`` There is a man---man%1:18:00:: named Grabski---person%1:03:00:: who is the foreman---foreman%1:18:00:: in charge of the bricklayers---bricklayer%1:18:00:: at Majdanek---location%1:03:00:: .
I told him you are on orders---order%1:10:03:: from the Home Army---group%1:03:00:: to get inside Majdanek---location%1:03:00:: so you can make a report---report%1:10:03:: to the government in exile---government%1:14:00:: in London---london%1:15:00:: '' .
`` His answer---answer%1:10:00:: '' ?
`` Ten thousand---ten_thousand%1:23:00:: zlotys---zloty%1:23:00:: '' .
`` He is aware he will not live for twenty-four hours---twenty-four_hours%1:28:00:: if he betrays you '' .
`` Good man---man%1:18:00:: , Styka---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` Captain Jan---person%1:03:00:: , must you go inside Majdanek---location%1:03:00:: ?
The stories---story%1:10:03:: .
`` Not everyone , Styka---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` What good---good%1:07:00:: will it really do '' ?
Perhaps - perhaps - there is a shred---shred%1:23:00:: of conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: left in the human race .
Perhaps if they know the story---story%1:10:03:: there will be a massive cry---cry%1:10:00:: of indignation---indignation%1:12:00:: '' .
`` Do you really believe that , Jan---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Styka---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: slowly .
`` I am only a simple soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: .
I cannot think things---thing%1:26:00:: out too well .
Until I was transferred into the Seventh Ulanys---group%1:03:00:: I was like every other Pole---pole%1:18:00:: in my feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: about Jews---jew%1:18:00:: .
But my captain---captain%1:18:05:: might have been a Jew---jew%1:18:00:: , but he was n't a Jew---jew%1:18:00:: .
What I mean is , he was a Pole---pole%1:18:00:: and the greatest soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: in the Ulanys---group%1:03:00:: .
Hell , sir---sir%1:18:00:: .
The men---man%1:18:03:: of our company---company%1:14:03:: had a dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: fights---fight%1:04:02:: defending your name---name%1:26:00:: .
You never knew about it , but by God---god%1:18:00:: , we taught them respect---respect%1:26:00:: for Captain Androfski---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Andrei---person%1:03:00:: smiled .
`` Since the war---war%1:04:00:: I have seen the way---way%1:07:01:: the Germans---german%1:18:00:: have behaved and I think , Holy Mother , we have behaved like this for hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of years---years%1:28:00:: .
`` How can you tell an insane man---man%1:18:00:: to reason or a blind man to see '' ?
The men---man%1:18:03:: of your company---company%1:14:03:: would not allow your name---name%1:26:00:: dishonored .
Why do we let the Germans---german%1:18:00:: do this '' ?
`` I have sat many hours---hour%1:28:00:: with this , Styka---person%1:03:00:: .
All I ever wanted was to be a free man---freeman%1:18:00:: in my own country---country%1:15:00:: .
I 've lost faith---faith%1:09:01:: , Styka---person%1:03:00:: .
I used to love this country---country%1:15:00:: and believe that someday we 'd win our battle---battle%1:04:01:: for equality---equality%1:07:00:: .
`` And do you really think that the world---world%1:14:02:: outside Poland---location%1:03:00:: will care any more than we do '' ?
The question---question%1:10:00:: frightened Andrei---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Please do n't go inside Majdanek---location%1:03:00:: '' .
`` I'm still a soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: in a very small way---way%1:07:01:: , Styka---person%1:03:00:: '' .
It was an answer---answer%1:10:00:: that Styka---person%1:03:00:: understood .
Grabski---person%1:03:00:: 's shanty---shanty%1:06:00:: was beyond the bridge---bridge%1:06:00:: over the River Bystrzyca---location%1:03:00:: near the rail---rail%1:06:03:: center---center%1:06:00:: .
Grabski---person%1:03:00:: sat in a sweat---sweat%1:08:00:: saturated undershirt---undershirt%1:06:00:: , cursing the excessive heat---heat%1:09:00:: which clamped an uneasy stillness---stillness%1:26:00:: before sundown---sundown%1:28:00:: .
He was a square brick---brick%1:18:00:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: with a moon round face---face%1:08:00:: and sunken Polish features---feature%1:08:00:: .
Flies---fly%1:05:00:: swarmed around the bowl---bowl%1:06:00:: of lentils---lentil%1:13:00:: in which he mopped thick black bread---black_bread%1:13:00:: .
Half---half%1:23:00:: of it dripped down his chin---chin%1:08:00:: .
He washed it down with beer---beer%1:13:00:: and produced a deep-seated belch---belch%1:04:00:: .
Andrei---person%1:03:00:: demanded .
Grabski---person%1:03:00:: looked at the pair---pair%1:14:00:: of them .
He grunted a sort of `` yes---yes%1:10:00:: '' answer---answer%1:10:00:: .

Andrei---person%1:03:00:: and Styka---person%1:03:00:: were silent .
Rather than being deceived , the eye---eye%1:09:00:: is puzzled ; instead of seeing objects---object%1:03:00:: in space---space%1:03:00:: , it sees nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: more than - a picture---picture%1:06:00:: .
Through 1911 and 1912 , as the Cubist facet-plane---facet_plane%1:25:00:: 's tendency---tendency%1:12:00:: to adhere to the literal surface---surface%1:15:00:: became harder and harder to deny , the task---task%1:04:00:: of keeping the surface---surface%1:06:00:: at arm's length---arm's_length%1:07:00:: fell all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivances---contrivance%1:09:01:: .
To reinforce , and sometimes to replace , the simulated typography---typography%1:04:00:: , Braque---person%1:03:00:: and Picasso---person%1:03:00:: began to mix sand---sand%1:27:00:: and other foreign substances---substance%1:03:00:: with their paint---paint%1:06:00:: ; the granular texture---texture%1:07:00:: thus created likewise called attention to the reality---reality%1:26:01:: of the surface---surface%1:15:00:: and was effective over much larger areas---area%1:15:01:: .
In certain other pictures---picture%1:06:01:: , however , Braque---person%1:03:00:: began to paint areas---area%1:15:01:: in exact simulation---simulation%1:04:01:: of wood---wood%1:27:00:: graining---graining%1:07:00:: or marbleizing---marbleizing%1:07:00:: .
These areas---area%1:15:01:: by virtue of their abrupt density---density%1:07:01:: of pattern---pattern%1:06:00:: , stated the literal surface---surface%1:15:00:: with such new and superior force---force%1:07:00:: that the resulting contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: drove the simulated printing---printing%1:10:01:: into a depth---depth%1:07:00:: from which it could be rescued - and set to shuttling again - only by conventional perspective---perspective%1:07:00:: ; that is , by being placed in such relation---relation%1:03:00:: to the forms---form%1:03:00:: depicted within the illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: that these forms---form%1:03:00:: left no room---room%1:23:00:: for the typography---typography%1:10:00:: except near the surface---surface%1:06:00:: .
The accumulation---accumulation%1:04:00:: of such devices---device%1:06:00:: , however , soon had the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of telescoping , even while separating , surface---surface%1:15:00:: and depth---depth%1:07:00:: .
The process of flattening seemed inexorable , and it became necessary to emphasize the surface---surface%1:06:00:: still further in order to prevent it from fusing with the illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: .
It was for this reason---reason%1:16:00:: , and no other that I can see , that in September---september%1:28:00:: 1912 , Braque---person%1:03:00:: took the radical and revolutionary step---step%1:04:02:: of pasting actual pieces---piece%1:06:00:: of imitation woodgrain---woodgrain%1:07:00:: wallpaper---wallpaper%1:27:00:: to a drawing---drawing%1:10:00:: on paper---paper%1:27:00:: , instead of trying to simulate its texture---texture%1:07:00:: in paint---paint%1:06:00:: .
Picasso---person%1:03:00:: says that he himself had already made his first collage---collage%1:06:00:: toward the end---end%1:28:00:: of 1911 , when he glued a piece---piece%1:06:00:: of imitation caning---caning%1:06:00:: oilcloth---oilcloth%1:06:00:: to a painting---painting%1:06:00:: on canvas---canvas%1:06:00:: .
It is true that his first collage---collage%1:06:00:: looks more Analytical---analytical_cubism%1:14:00:: than Braque---person%1:03:00:: 's , which would confirm the date---date%1:28:00:: he assigns it .
But it is also true that Braque---person%1:03:00:: was the consistent pioneer---pioneer%1:18:01:: in the use---use%1:04:00:: of simulated textures---texture%1:07:00:: as well as of typography---typography%1:04:00:: ; and moreover , he had already begun to broaden and simplify the facet-planes---facet_plane%1:25:00:: of Analytical Cubism---analytical_cubism%1:14:00:: as far back as the end---end%1:28:00:: of 1910 .
When we examine what each master---master%1:18:00:: says was his first collage---collage%1:06:00:: we see that much the same thing---thing%1:04:00:: happens in each .
( It makes no real difference---difference%1:07:00:: that Braque---person%1:03:00:: 's collage---collage%1:06:00:: is on paper and eked out in charcoal---charcoal%1:06:00:: , while Picasso---person%1:03:00:: 's is on canvas---canvas%1:06:00:: and eked out in oil---oil%1:06:01:: . )
By its greater corporeal presence---presence%1:26:00:: and its greater extraneousness---extraneousness%1:24:00:: , the affixed paper---paper%1:27:00:: or cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: serves for a seeming moment---moment%1:28:01:: to push everything else into a more vivid idea---idea%1:09:00:: of depth---depth%1:07:00:: than the simulated printing---printing%1:10:01:: or simulated textures---texture%1:07:00:: had ever done .
But here again , the surface---surface%1:15:00:: declaring device---device%1:06:00:: both overshoots and falls short of its aim---aim%1:09:00:: .
For the illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: of depth---depth%1:07:00:: created by the contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: between the affixed material---material%1:06:00:: and everything else gives way immediately to an illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: of forms---form%1:03:00:: in bas-relief , which gives way in turn , and with equal immediacy---immediacy%1:07:02:: , to an illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: that seems to contain both - or neither .
Because of the size---size%1:07:00:: of the areas---area%1:15:01:: it covers , the pasted paper---paper%1:27:00:: establishes undepicted flatness---flatness%1:07:00:: bodily , as more than an indication---indication%1:10:00:: or sign---sign%1:10:05:: .
Literal flatness---flatness%1:07:00:: now tends to assert itself as the main event---event%1:03:00:: of the picture---picture%1:06:01:: , and the device---device%1:06:00:: boomerangs : the illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: of depth---depth%1:07:00:: is rendered even more precarious than before .
Instead of isolating the literal flatness---flatness%1:07:00:: by specifying and circumscribing it , the pasted paper---paper%1:27:00:: or cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: releases and spreads it , and the artist---artist%1:18:00:: seems to have nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: left but this undepicted flatness---flatness%1:07:00:: with which to finish as well as start his picture---picture%1:06:01:: .
The actual surface---surface%1:06:00:: becomes both ground---ground%1:09:00:: and background---background%1:09:00:: , and it turns out - suddenly and paradoxically - that the only place---place%1:04:01:: left for a three-dimensional illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: is in front of , upon , the surface---surface%1:06:00:: .
In their very first collages---collage%1:06:00:: , Braque---person%1:03:00:: and Picasso---person%1:03:00:: draw or paint over and on the affixed paper---paper%1:27:00:: or cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: , so that certain of the principal features---feature%1:09:00:: of their subjects---subject%1:06:00:: as depicted seem to thrust out into real , bas-relief space---space%1:25:00:: - or to be about to do so - while the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the subject---subject%1:06:00:: remains imbedded in , or flat upon , the surface---surface%1:06:00:: .
And the surface---surface%1:06:00:: is driven back , in its very surfaceness , only by this contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: .
In the upper center---center%1:15:01:: of Braque---person%1:03:00:: 's first collage---collage%1:06:00:: , Fruit Dish ( in Douglas Cooper---person%1:03:00:: 's collection---collection%1:14:00:: ) , a bunch---bunch%1:14:00:: of grapes---grape%1:13:00:: is rendered with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect---effect%1:07:00:: as to lift it practically off the picture plane---picture_plane%1:25:00:: .
The trompe-l'oeil---trompe_l'oeil%1:06:00:: illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: here is no longer enclosed between parallel flatnesses---flatness%1:07:00:: , but seems to thrust through the surface---surface%1:06:00:: of the drawing paper---drawing_paper%1:27:00:: and establish depth---depth%1:07:00:: on top of it .
Yet the violent immediacy---immediacy%1:07:02:: of the wallpaper---wallpaper%1:27:00:: strips---strip%1:17:00:: pasted to the paper---paper%1:27:00:: , and the only lesser immediacy---immediacy%1:07:02:: of block capitals---block_capital%1:10:00:: that simulate window---window%1:06:02:: lettering---lettering%1:10:00:: , manage somehow to push the grape---grape%1:13:00:: cluster---cluster%1:14:00:: back into place---place%1:04:01:: on the picture plane---picture_plane%1:25:00:: so that it does not `` jump '' .
At the same time , the wallpaper---wallpaper%1:27:00:: strips---strip%1:17:00:: themselves seem to be pushed into depth---depth%1:07:00:: by the lines---line%1:10:01:: and patches---patch%1:07:00:: of shading---shading%1:07:00:: charcoaled upon them , and by their placing---placement%1:07:00:: in relation to the block capitals---block_capital%1:10:00:: ; and these capitals---capital%1:10:00:: seem in turn to be pushed back by their placing---placement%1:07:00:: , and by contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: with the corporeality---corporeality%1:07:00:: of the woodgraining---woodgraining%1:07:00:: .
Thus every part---part%1:06:00:: and plane---plane%1:25:00:: of the picture---picture%1:06:01:: keeps changing place---place%1:15:00:: in relative depth---depth%1:07:00:: with every other part---part%1:06:00:: and plane---plane%1:25:00:: ; and it is as if the only stable relation---relation%1:03:00:: left among the different parts---part%1:06:00:: of the picture---picture%1:06:01:: is the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each has with the surface---surface%1:06:00:: .
And the same thing---thing%1:10:00:: , more or less , can be said of the contents---content%1:14:00:: of Picasso---person%1:03:00:: 's first collage---collage%1:06:00:: .
In later collages---collage%1:06:00:: of both masters---master%1:18:00:: , a variety---variety%1:14:01:: of extraneous materials---material%1:06:00:: are used , sometimes in the same work---work%1:06:00:: , and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device---device%1:06:00:: they can think of .
The area---area%1:15:01:: adjacent to one edge---edge%1:15:00:: of a piece---piece%1:06:00:: of affixed material---material%1:06:00:: - or simply of a painted in form---form%1:07:01:: - will be shaded to pry that edge---edge%1:15:00:: away from the surface---surface%1:06:00:: , while something will be drawn , painted or even pasted over another part---part%1:06:00:: of the same shape---shape%1:07:00:: to drive it back into depth---depth%1:07:00:: .
Planes---plane%1:25:00:: defined as parallel to the surface---surface%1:06:00:: also cut through it into real space---space%1:03:00:: , and a depth---depth%1:07:00:: is suggested optically which is greater than that established pictorially .
All this expands the oscillation---oscillation%1:22:00:: between surface---surface%1:15:00:: and depth---depth%1:07:00:: so as to encompass fictive space---space%1:03:00:: in front of the surface---surface%1:06:00:: as well as behind it .
Flatness---flatness%1:07:00:: may now monopolize everything , but it is a flatness---flatness%1:07:00:: become so ambiguous and expanded as to turn into illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: itself - at least an optical if not , properly speaking , a pictorial illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: .
Depicted , Cubist flatness---flatness%1:07:00:: is now almost completely assimilated to the literal , undepicted kind---kind%1:09:00:: , but at the same time it reacts upon and largely transforms the undepicted kind---kind%1:09:00:: - and it does so , moreover , without depriving the latter of its literalness---literalness%1:07:00:: ; rather , it underpins and reinforces that literalness---literalness%1:07:00:: , re-creates it .
Out of this re-created literalness---literalness%1:07:00:: , the Cubist---group%1:03:00:: subject---subject%1:06:00:: reemerged .
For it had turned out , by a further paradox---paradox%1:10:00:: of Cubism---cubism%1:14:00:: , that the means---means%1:06:00:: to an illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: of depth---depth%1:07:00:: and plasticity---plasticity%1:07:00:: had now become widely divergent from the means---means%1:06:00:: of representation---representation%1:06:00:: or imaging---imaging%1:09:00:: .
In the Analytical---analytical_cubism%1:14:00:: phase---phase%1:28:00:: of their Cubism , Braque---person%1:03:00:: and Picasso---person%1:03:00:: had not only had to minimize three-dimensionality---three-dimensionality%1:07:00:: simply in order to preserve it ; they had also had to generalize it - to the point---point%1:10:01:: , finally , where the illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: of depth---depth%1:07:00:: and relief became abstracted from specific three-dimensional entities---entity%1:03:00:: and was rendered largely as the illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: of depth---depth%1:07:00:: and relief as such : as a disembodied attribute---attribute%1:03:00:: and expropriated property---property%1:07:00:: detached from everything not itself .
In order to be saved , plasticity---plasticity%1:07:00:: had had to be isolated ; and as the aspect---aspect%1:09:01:: of the subject---subject%1:06:00:: was transposed into those clusters---cluster%1:14:00:: of more or less interchangeable and contour---contour%1:07:00:: obliterating facet-planes---facet_plane%1:25:00:: by which plasticity---plasticity%1:07:00:: was isolated under the Cubist method---method%1:09:00:: , the subject---subject%1:06:00:: itself became largely unrecognizable .
Cubism---cubism%1:14:00:: , in its 1911 - 1912 phase---phase%1:28:00:: ( which the French , with justice---justice%1:07:00:: , call `` hermetic '' ) was on the verge---verge%1:25:00:: of abstract art---abstract_art%1:06:00:: .
It was then that Picasso---person%1:03:00:: and Braque---person%1:03:00:: were confronted with a unique dilemma---dilemma%1:09:00:: : they had to choose between illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: and representation---representation%1:06:00:: .
If they opted for illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: , it could only be illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: per se - an illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: of depth---depth%1:07:00:: , and of relief , so general and abstracted as to exclude the representation---representation%1:06:00:: of individual objects---object%1:03:00:: .
If , on the other hand , they opted for representation---representation%1:06:00:: , it had to be representation---representation%1:06:00:: per se - representation---representation%1:06:00:: as image---image%1:06:00:: pure and simple , without connotations---connotation%1:09:00:: ( at least , without more than schematic ones ) of the three-dimensional space---space%1:03:00:: in which the objects---object%1:03:00:: represented originally existed .
It was the collage---collage%1:06:00:: that made the terms---term%1:10:01:: of this dilemma---dilemma%1:09:00:: clear : the representational could be restored and preserved only on the flat and literal surface---surface%1:06:00:: now that illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: and representation---representation%1:06:00:: had become , for the first time , mutually exclusive alternatives---alternative%1:09:00:: .
In the end , Picasso---person%1:03:00:: and Braque---person%1:03:00:: plumped for the representational , and it would seem they did so deliberately .
( This provides whatever real justification---justification%1:10:00:: there is for the talk---talk%1:10:00:: about `` reality---reality%1:26:01:: '' . )
But the inner , formal logic---formal_logic%1:09:00:: of Cubism---cubism%1:14:00:: , as it worked itself out through the collage---collage%1:06:00:: , had just as much to do with shaping their decision---decision%1:04:00:: .
When the smaller facet-planes---facet_plane%1:25:00:: of Analytical Cubism---analytical_cubism%1:14:00:: were placed upon or juxtaposed with the large , dense shapes---shape%1:07:00:: formed by the affixed materials---material%1:06:00:: of the collage---collage%1:06:00:: , they had to coalesce - become `` synthesized '' - into larger planar shapes---shape%1:07:00:: themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity---integrity%1:26:00:: of the picture plane---picture_plane%1:25:00:: .
Left in their previous atom-like smallness---smallness%1:07:00:: , they would have cut away too abruptly into depth---depth%1:07:00:: ; and the broad , opaque shapes---shape%1:07:00:: of pasted paper---paper%1:27:00:: would have been isolated in such a way---way%1:07:01:: as to make them jump out of plane---plane%1:25:00:: .
Large planes---plane%1:25:00:: juxtaposed with other large planes---plane%1:25:00:: tend to assert themselves as independent shapes---shape%1:07:00:: , and to the extent that they are flat , they also assert themselves as silhouettes---silhouette%1:15:00:: ; and independent silhouettes---silhouette%1:15:00:: are apt to coincide with the recognizable contours---contour%1:10:00:: of the subject---subject%1:06:00:: from which a picture---picture%1:06:01:: starts ( if it does start from a subject---subject%1:06:00:: ) .
It was because of this chain-reaction---chain_reaction%1:22:01:: as much as for any other reason---reason%1:16:00:: - that is , because of the growing independence---independence%1:26:00:: of the planar unit---unit%1:09:00:: in collage---collage%1:06:00:: as a shape---shape%1:07:00:: - that the identity---identity%1:09:00:: of depicted objects---depicted_object%1:06:00:: , or at least parts---part%1:06:00:: of them , re-emerged in Braque---person%1:03:00:: 's and Picasso---person%1:03:00:: 's papiers colles and continued to remain more conspicuous there - but only as flattened silhouettes---silhouette%1:15:00:: - than in any of their paintings---painting%1:06:00:: done wholly in oil---oil%1:06:01:: before the end---end%1:28:00:: of 1913 .
Analytical Cubism---analytical_cubism%1:14:00:: came to an end---end%1:26:00:: in the collage---collage%1:06:00:: , but not conclusively ; nor did Synthetic Cubism---synthetic_cubism%1:14:00:: fully begin there .
Only when the collage---collage%1:06:00:: had been exhaustively translated into oil---oil%1:06:01:: , and transformed by this translation---translation%1:10:00:: , did Cubism---cubism%1:14:00:: become an affair---affair%1:09:00:: of positive color---color%1:07:00:: and flat , interlocking silhouettes---silhouette%1:15:00:: whose legibility---legibility%1:07:01:: and placement---placement%1:07:00:: created allusions---allusion%1:10:00:: to , if not the illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: of , unmistakable three-dimensional identities---identity%1:09:00:: .
Synthetic Cubism---synthetic_cubism%1:14:00:: began with Picasso---person%1:03:00:: alone , late in 1913 or early in 1914 ; this was the point at which he finally took the lead---lead%1:07:02:: in Cubist innovation---innovation%1:09:00:: away from Braque---person%1:03:00:: , never again to relinquish it .
But even before that , Picasso---person%1:03:00:: had glimpsed and entered , for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: , a certain revolutionary path in which no one had preceded him .
It was as though , in that instant---instant%1:28:01:: , he had felt the flatness---flatness%1:07:00:: of collage---collage%1:06:00:: as too constricting and had suddenly tried to escape all the way back - or forward - to literal three-dimensionality---three-dimensionality%1:07:00:: .
This he did by using utterly literal means---means%1:06:00:: to carry the forward push---push%1:19:00:: of the collage---collage%1:06:00:: ( and of Cubism---cubism%1:14:00:: in general ) literally into the literal space---space%1:03:00:: in front of the picture plane---picture_plane%1:25:00:: .
Some time---time%1:11:00:: in 1912 , Picasso---person%1:03:00:: cut out and folded a piece of paper---piece_of_paper%1:10:00:: in the shape---shape%1:07:00:: of a guitar---guitar%1:06:00:: ; to this he glued and fitted other pieces of paper---piece_of_paper%1:10:00:: and four taut strings---string%1:06:03:: , thus creating a sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: of flat surfaces---surface%1:15:00:: in real and sculptural space---space%1:03:00:: to which there clung only the vestige---vestige%1:10:00:: of a picture plane---picture_plane%1:25:00:: .
The affixed elements---element%1:06:00:: of collage---collage%1:06:00:: were extruded , as it were , and cut off from the literal pictorial surface---surface%1:06:00:: to form a bas-relief---bas_relief%1:06:00:: .
The lyric beauties---beauty%1:07:00:: of Schubert---person%1:03:00:: 's Trout Quintet - its elemental rhythms---rhythm%1:10:01:: and infectious melodies---melody%1:10:00:: - make it a source---source%1:15:00:: of pure pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: for almost all music---music%1:10:00:: listeners---listener%1:18:00:: .
But for students---student%1:18:01:: of musical forms---form%1:09:00:: and would-be classifiers---classifier%1:18:00:: , the work---work%1:06:00:: presents its problems---problem%1:26:00:: .
Since it requires only five players---player%1:18:02:: , it would seem to fall into the category---category%1:14:00:: of chamber music---chamber_music%1:10:00:: - yet it calls for a double bass---double_bass%1:06:00:: , an instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: generally regarded as symphonic .
Moreover , the piece---piece%1:10:01:: is written in five movements---movement%1:10:00:: , rather than the conventional four of most quintets---quintet%1:10:00:: , and this gives the opus---opus%1:10:00:: a serenade---serenade%1:10:01:: or divertimento---divertimento%1:10:00:: flavor---flavor%1:26:00:: .
The many and frequent performances---performance%1:04:01:: of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature---nature%1:07:01:: of its writing---writing%1:04:02:: .
Some renditions---rendition%1:10:00:: are of symphonic dimensions---dimension%1:09:00:: , with the contrabass---contrabass%1:06:00:: given free rein---free_rein%1:26:00:: .
Other interpretations---interpretation%1:04:02:: present the music---music%1:10:00:: as an essentially intimate creation---creation%1:06:00:: .
In these readings---reading%1:10:01:: , the double bass---double_bass%1:06:00:: is either kept discreetly in the background---background%1:11:01:: , or it is dressed in clown---clown%1:18:00:: 's attire---attire%1:06:00:: - the musical equivalent---equivalent%1:09:00:: of a bull in a china shop .
Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches---approach%1:04:02:: , when in the course---course%1:14:00:: of one afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: and evening---evening%1:28:00:: I listened to no fewer than ten different performances---performance%1:04:01:: .
The occasion---occasion%1:16:00:: for this marathon---marathon%1:04:00:: : Angel---group%1:03:00:: 's long awaited reissue---reissue%1:10:00:: in its `` Great Recordings of the Century '' series---series%1:10:00:: of the Schnabel-Pro Arte version---version%1:10:01:: .
Let me say at the outset---outset%1:28:00:: that the music---music%1:10:00:: sounded as sparkling on the last playing---playing%1:04:01:: as it did on the first .
Whether considered alone or in relation to other editions---edition%1:10:02:: , COLH 40 is a document---document%1:06:00:: of prime importance---importance%1:07:00:: .
Artur Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: was one of the greatest Schubert-Beethoven-Mozart---person%1:03:00:: players---player%1:18:02:: of all time , and any commentary---commentary%1:10:00:: of his on this repertory---repertory%1:06:00:: is valuable .
But Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: was a great teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: in addition to being a great performer---performer%1:18:00:: , and the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that four of the ten versions---version%1:10:01:: I listened to are by Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: pupils---pupil%1:18:00:: ( Clifford Curzon---person%1:03:00:: , Frank Glazer---person%1:03:00:: , Adrian Aeschbacher---person%1:03:00:: , and Victor Babin---person%1:03:00:: ) also sheds light on the master---master%1:18:00:: 's pedagogical skills---skill%1:09:01:: .
Certain pianistic traits---trait%1:07:00:: are common to all five Schnabelian---person%1:03:00:: renditions---rendition%1:10:00:: , most notably the `` Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: trill---trill%1:10:00:: '' ( which differs from the conventional trill---trill%1:10:00:: in that the two notes---note%1:10:04:: are struck simultaneously ) .
But the most impressive testimony---testimony%1:10:02:: to Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: 's distinction---distinction%1:26:00:: as a teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: is reflected by the individuality---individuality%1:07:00:: which marks each student---student%1:18:00:: 's approach---approach%1:04:02:: as distinctly his own .
Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: 's emphasis---emphasis%1:07:00:: on structural clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: , his innate rhythmic vibrancy---vibrancy%1:07:00:: , and impetuous intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: all tend to stamp his reading---reading%1:10:01:: as a symphonic one .
Yet no detail---detail%1:09:00:: was too small to receive attention---attention%1:04:01:: from this master---master%1:18:00:: , and as a result---result%1:19:00:: the playing---playing%1:04:01:: here has humor---humor%1:07:01:: , delicacy---delicacy%1:07:00:: , and radiant humanity---humanity%1:07:00:: .
This is a serious minded interpretation---interpretation%1:04:02:: , but it is never strait-laced .
And although Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: 's pianism---pianism%1:10:00:: bristles with excitement---excitement%1:04:00:: , it is meticulously faithful to Schubert---person%1:03:00:: 's dynamic markings---marking%1:07:00:: and phrase---phrase%1:10:01:: indications---indication%1:10:00:: .
The piano---piano%1:06:00:: performance---performance%1:04:01:: on this Trout---person%1:03:00:: is one that really demands a search---search%1:04:00:: for superlatives---superlative%1:10:00:: .
About the Pro Arte---group%1:03:00:: 's contribution---contribution%1:04:02:: I am less happy .
I , for one , rather regret that Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: did n't collaborate with the Budapest Quartet---group%1:03:00:: , whose rugged , athletic playing---playing%1:04:01:: was a good deal---good_deal%1:23:00:: closer to this pianist---pianist%1:18:00:: 's interpretative outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: than the style---style%1:07:00:: of the Belgian group---group%1:03:00:: .
From a technical standpoint---standpoint%1:09:00:: , the string---string%1:06:05:: playing---playing%1:04:01:: is good , but the Pro Arte---group%1:03:00:: people---people%1:14:00:: fail to enter into the spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: of things---thing%1:09:00:: here .
The violinist---violinist%1:18:00:: , in particular---particular%1:09:00:: , is very indulgent with swoops---swoop%1:10:00:: and slides---slide%1:10:00:: , and his tone---tone%1:07:01:: is pinched and edgy .
The twenty-five year---year%1:28:01:: old recording---recording%1:06:00:: offers rather faded string---string%1:06:05:: tone---tone%1:07:01:: , but the balance---balance%1:21:00:: between the instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: is good and the transfer---transfer%1:04:03:: is very quiet .
There is a break---break%1:11:00:: in continuity---continuity%1:26:00:: just before the fourth variation---variation%1:10:00:: in the `` Forellen '' movement---movement%1:10:00:: , and I suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing---splicing%1:06:00:: between sides---side%1:15:02:: of the original---original%1:06:00:: SPs .
Turning to the more modern versions---version%1:10:01:: , Curzon---person%1:03:00:: 's ( London---london%1:15:00:: ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard---keyboard%1:06:01:: work---work%1:04:00:: .
Every detail---detail%1:09:00:: in his interpretation---interpretation%1:04:02:: has been beautifully thought out , and of these I would especially cite the delicious landler---landler%1:10:00:: touch---touch%1:07:01:: the pianist---pianist%1:18:00:: brings to the fifth variation---variation%1:10:00:: ( an obvious indication---indication%1:10:00:: that he is playing with Viennese musicians---musician%1:18:01:: ) , and the gossamer shading---shade%1:10:00:: throughout .
Some of Curzon---person%1:03:00:: 's playing---playing%1:04:01:: strikes me as finicky , however .
Why , for example , does he favor two tempos---tempo%1:28:01:: , rather than one , for the third movement---movement%1:10:00:: ?
The assisting musicians---musician%1:18:01:: from the Vienna Octet---group%1:03:00:: are somewhat lacking in expertise---expertise%1:09:00:: , but their contribution---contribution%1:04:02:: is rustic and appealing .
( Special compliments---compliment%1:10:00:: to the double bass---double_bass%1:06:00:: playing---playing%1:04:01:: of Johann Krumpp---person%1:03:00:: :
his scrawny , tottering sound---sound%1:07:00:: adds a delightful hilarity---hilarity%1:12:00:: to the performance---performance%1:04:01:: . )
The Glazer-Fine Arts edition---edition%1:14:00:: ( Concert-Disc ) is a model---model%1:09:01:: of lucidity---lucidity%1:07:00:: and organization---organization%1:09:00:: .
It is , moreover , a perfectly integrated ensemble---ensemble%1:14:02:: effort---effort%1:04:00:: .
But having lived with the disc---disc%1:06:01:: for some time---time%1:28:00:: now , I find the performance---performance%1:04:01:: less exciting than either Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: 's or Fleisher---person%1:03:00:: 's ( whose superb performance---performance%1:04:01:: with the Budapest Quartet---group%1:03:00:: has still to be recorded ) and a good deal---good_deal%1:23:00:: less filled with humor---humor%1:12:00:: than Curzon---person%1:03:00:: 's .
Aeschbacher---person%1:03:00:: 's work---work%1:06:00:: is very much akin to Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: 's , but the sound---sound%1:10:00:: on his Decca disc---disc%1:06:01:: is dated , and you will have a hard time---hard_time%1:26:00:: locating a copy---copy%1:06:00:: of it .
The Hephzibah Menuhin-Amadeus Quartet---group%1:03:00:: ( Angel---group%1:03:00:: ) and Victor Babin-Festival Quartet---group%1:03:00:: ( RCA Victor---group%1:03:00:: ) editions---edition%1:14:00:: give us superlative string---string%1:06:05:: playing---playing%1:04:01:: ( both in symphonic style---style%1:07:00:: ) crippled by unimaginative piano---piano%1:06:00:: playing---playing%1:04:01:: .
( Babin---person%1:03:00:: has acquired some of Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: 's keyboard---keyboard%1:06:01:: manner---manner%1:07:02:: , but his playing---playing%1:04:01:: is of limited insight---insight%1:12:00:: . )
Badura-Skoda-Vienna Konzerthaus ( Westminster---group%1:03:00:: ) and Demus-Schubert Quartet---group%1:03:00:: ( Deutsche Grammophon---group%1:03:00:: ) are both warm toned , pleasantly lyrical , but rather slack and tensionless .
Helmut Roloff---person%1:03:00:: , playing with a group---group%1:03:00:: of musicians---musician%1:18:01:: from the Bayreuth Ensemble---group%1:03:00:: , gives a sturdy reading---reading%1:10:01:: , in much the same vein---vein%1:10:00:: as that of the last mentioned pianists---pianist%1:18:00:: .
Telefunken---group%1:03:00:: has accorded him beautiful sound---sound%1:07:00:: , and this bargain-priced disc---disc%1:06:01:: ( it sells for $ 2.98 ) is worthy of consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: .
Returning once again to the Schnabel---person%1:03:00:: reissue , I am beguiled anew by the magnificence---magnificence%1:07:02:: of this pianist---pianist%1:18:00:: 's musical penetration---penetration%1:09:00:: .
Here is truly a `` Great Recording---recording%1:06:00:: of the Century---century%1:28:00:: '' , and its greatness---greatness%1:07:00:: is by no means diminished by the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that it is not quite perfect .
This recording---recording%1:06:00:: surely belongs in everyone 's collection---collection%1:14:00:: .
Must records---record%1:06:00:: always sound like records---record%1:06:00:: ?
From the beginning---beginning%1:28:00:: of commercial recording---recording%1:04:00:: , new discs---disc%1:06:01:: purported to be indistinguishable from The Real Thing---real_thing%1:07:00:: have regularly been put in circulation---circulation%1:10:00:: .
Seen in perspective---perspective%1:09:00:: , many of these releases---release%1:06:00:: have a genuine claim---claim%1:07:02:: to be milestones---milestone%1:11:00:: .
Although lacking absolute verisimilitude---verisimilitude%1:07:00:: , they supply the ear---ear%1:09:00:: and the imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: with all necessary materials---material%1:10:00:: for re-creation---re-creation%1:04:00:: of the original---original%1:06:00:: .
On the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso---person%1:03:00:: sang , appreciate the distinctive qualities---quality%1:07:01:: of Parsifal---person%1:03:00:: under Karl Muck---person%1:03:00:: 's baton---baton%1:06:00:: , or sense the type---type%1:09:00:: of ensemble---ensemble%1:14:02:: Toscanini---person%1:03:00:: created in his years---year%1:28:01:: with the New York Philharmonic---group%1:03:00:: .
Since the concept---concept%1:09:00:: of high fidelity---high_fidelity%1:04:00:: became important some dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: years---year%1:28:01:: ago , the claims---claim%1:10:00:: of technical improvements---improvement%1:04:00:: have multiplied tenfold .
In many cases---case%1:11:00:: the revolutionary production---production%1:10:00:: has offered no more than sensational effects---effect%1:09:00:: :
the first hearing---hearing%1:04:00:: was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap---gap%1:07:00:: between sound---sound%1:10:00:: and substance---substance%1:09:01:: became clearer .
Other innovations---innovation%1:06:00:: with better claims---claim%1:07:02:: to musical interest---interest%1:09:00:: survived rehearing---rehearing%1:04:00:: to acquire in time the status---status%1:26:00:: of classics---classic%1:06:00:: .
If we return to them today , we have no difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: spotting their weaknesses---weakness%1:26:00:: but we find them still pleasing .
Records---record%1:06:00:: sound like records---record%1:06:00:: because they provide a different sort---sort%1:09:00:: of experience---experience%1:09:00:: than live music---music%1:10:00:: .
This difference---difference%1:07:00:: is made up of many factors---factor%1:11:00:: .
Some of them are obvious , such as the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that we associate recorded and live music---music%1:10:00:: with our responses---response%1:04:01:: and behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: in different types---type%1:09:00:: of environments---environment%1:26:00:: and social settings---setting%1:26:00:: .
( Music---music%1:04:00:: often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre---theatre%1:06:00:: seat---seat%1:15:01:: . )
From the technical standpoint---standpoint%1:09:00:: , records---record%1:06:00:: differ from live music---music%1:10:00:: to the degree---degree%1:26:01:: that they fail to convey the true color---color%1:07:02:: , texture---texture%1:07:02:: , complexity---complexity%1:07:00:: , range---range%1:07:00:: , intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: , pulse---pulse%1:11:01:: , and pitch---pitch%1:07:00:: of the original---original%1:06:00:: .
Any alteration---alteration%1:11:00:: of one of these factors---factor%1:11:00:: is distortion---distortion%1:11:00:: , although we generally use that word---word%1:10:00:: only for effects---effect%1:19:00:: so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of standard tests---test%1:04:02:: .
Yet it is the accumulation---accumulation%1:14:00:: of distortion---distortion%1:11:00:: , the fitting together of fractional bits---bit%1:23:01:: until the total---total%1:06:00:: reaches the threshold---threshold%1:09:00:: of our awareness---awareness%1:09:00:: , that makes records---record%1:06:00:: sound like records---record%1:06:00:: .
The sound---sound%1:07:00:: may be good ; but if you know The Real Thing---real_thing%1:07:00:: , you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation---imitation%1:06:00:: .
Command---group%1:03:00:: 's new Brahms---person%1:03:00:: Second is a major effort---effort%1:04:00:: to make a record---record%1:06:00:: that sounds like a real orchestra---orchestra%1:14:00:: rather than a copy---copy%1:06:00:: of one .
Like the recent Scheherazade from London---group%1:03:00:: ( High Fidelity , Sept.---sept%1:28:00:: 1961 ) , it is successful because emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: has been placed on good musical and engineering---engineering%1:04:01:: practices---practice%1:04:00:: rather than on creating sensational effects---effect%1:09:00:: .
Because of this , only those with truly fine equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: will be able to appreciate the exact degree---degree%1:07:00:: of the engineers---engineer%1:18:00:: ' triumph---triumph%1:11:00:: .
The easiest way---way%1:04:01:: to describe this release---release%1:06:00:: is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg---person%1:03:00:: performance---performance%1:04:01:: with minimal alteration---alteration%1:11:00:: of its musical values---value%1:07:00:: .
The engineering---engineering%1:04:01:: as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: .
The effect---effect%1:07:00:: of the recording---recording%1:06:00:: is very open and natural , with the frequency---frequency%1:28:00:: emphasis---emphasis%1:07:00:: exactly what you would expect from a live performance---performance%1:04:01:: .
This absence---absence%1:26:00:: of peaky highs---high%1:07:00:: and beefed-up bass---bass%1:07:01:: not only produces greater fidelity---fidelity%1:07:02:: , but it eliminates listener---listener%1:18:00:: fatigue---fatigue%1:26:00:: .
A contributing factor---factor%1:11:00:: is the perspective---perspective%1:09:00:: , the uniform aesthetic distance---distance%1:07:00:: which is maintained .
The orchestra---orchestra%1:14:00:: is far enough away from you that you miss the bow---bow%1:06:00:: scrapes---scrape%1:11:00:: , valve---valve%1:06:01:: clicks---click%1:11:00:: , and other noises---noise%1:11:00:: incidental to playing---playing%1:04:01:: .
Yet you feel the orchestra---orchestra%1:14:00:: is near at hand , and the individual instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: have the same firm presence---presence%1:09:00:: associated with listening from a good seat---seat%1:15:01:: in an acoustically perfect hall---hall%1:06:02:: .
Command---group%1:03:00:: has achieved the ideal amount---amount%1:07:00:: of reverberation---reverberation%1:07:00:: .
The music---music%1:10:00:: is always allowed the living space---living_space%1:23:00:: needed to attain its full sonority---sonority%1:07:00:: ; yet the hall---hall%1:06:02:: never intrudes as a quasi performer---performer%1:18:00:: .
The timbre---timbre%1:07:00:: remains that of the instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: unclouded by resonance---resonance%1:19:00:: .
All of this would be wasted , of course , if the performance---performance%1:04:01:: lacked authority---authority%1:09:00:: and musical distinction---distinction%1:26:00:: .
For me it has more of both elements---element%1:09:00:: than the majority---majority%1:07:00:: of its competitors---competitor%1:18:00:: .
Steinberg---person%1:03:00:: seems to have gone directly back to the score---score%1:10:00:: , discounting tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: , and has built his performance---performance%1:04:01:: on the intention---intention%1:09:00:: to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms---person%1:03:00:: set down on paper .
Those accustomed to broader , more romantic statements---statement%1:10:04:: of the symphony---symphony%1:10:00:: can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one .
Without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm---rhythm%1:10:01:: , the pacing---pacing%1:28:00:: is firm and the over-all performance---performance%1:04:01:: has a tightly knit quality---quality%1:07:01:: that makes for maximum cumulative effect---effect%1:19:00:: .
The Presto ma non assai of the first trio---trio%1:10:00:: of the scherzo---scherzo%1:10:00:: is taken literally and may shock you , as the real Allegro con spirito---allegro_con_spirito%1:28:00:: of the finale---finale%1:10:00:: is likely to bring you to your feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
In the end , however , the thing---thing%1:07:00:: about this performance---performance%1:04:01:: that is most striking is the way---way%1:07:01:: it sings .
Steinberg---person%1:03:00:: obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element---element%1:09:00:: which must dominate in this score---score%1:10:00:: , and he manages at times to create the effect---effect%1:07:00:: of the whole orchestra---orchestra%1:14:00:: bursting into song---song%1:04:00:: .
The engineering---engineering%1:09:00:: provides exactly the support---support%1:04:04:: needed for such a result---result%1:19:00:: .
Too many records---record%1:06:00:: seem to reduce a work---work%1:06:00:: of symphonic complexity---complexity%1:07:00:: to a melody---melody%1:10:00:: and its accompaniment---accompaniment%1:10:00:: .
The Command---group%1:03:00:: technique---technique%1:09:00:: invites you to listen to the depth---depth%1:07:01:: of the orchestration---orchestration%1:10:00:: .
Your ear---ear%1:09:00:: takes you into the ensemble---ensemble%1:14:02:: , and you may well become aware of instrumental details---detail%1:09:00:: which previously were apparent only in the score---score%1:10:00:: .
It is this sort---sort%1:09:00:: of experience---experience%1:11:00:: that makes the concept---concept%1:09:00:: of high fidelity---high_fidelity%1:04:00:: of real musical significance---significance%1:07:00:: for the home music---music%1:10:00:: listener---listener%1:18:00:: .
The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope---scope%1:07:00:: since Feyer---person%1:03:00:: 's four-sided LP---lp%1:06:00:: edition---edition%1:10:02:: of 1958 for Angel---group%1:03:00:: ) , this set---set%1:14:00:: is , I'm afraid , likely to provide more horrid fascination---fascination%1:26:00:: than enjoyment---enjoyment%1:12:00:: .
The already faded pastel charms---charm%1:07:00:: of the naive music---music%1:10:00:: itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari---person%1:03:00:: 's melodramatic contrasts---contrast%1:24:00:: between ultra vehement brute power---power%1:07:00:: and chilly , if suave , sentimentality---sentimentality%1:07:00:: .
And in its engineers---engineer%1:18:00:: ' frantic attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: to achieve maximum dynamic impact---impact%1:19:00:: and earsplitting brilliance---brilliance%1:07:01:: , the recording---recording%1:06:00:: sounds as though it had been `` doctored for super high fidelity---high_fidelity%1:04:00:: '' .
The home listener---listener%1:18:00:: is overpowered , all right , but the experience---experience%1:11:00:: is a far from pleasant one .
As with the penultimate Giselle release---release%1:06:00:: ( Wolff---person%1:03:00:: 's abridgment---abridgment%1:10:00:: for RCA Victor---group%1:03:00:: ) I find the cleaner , less razor---razor%1:06:00:: edged monophonic version---version%1:10:01:: , for all its lack---lack%1:26:00:: of big stage---stage%1:06:00:: spaciousness---spaciousness%1:07:00:: , the more aurally tolerable - but this may be the result---result%1:19:00:: of processing---process%1:04:00:: defects---defect%1:26:00:: in my SD copies---copy%1:06:00:: .
Northern liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: are the chief supporters---supporter%1:18:00:: of civil rights and of integration---integration%1:04:00:: .
They have also led the nation---nation%1:14:00:: in the direction---direction%1:09:00:: of a welfare state---welfare_state%1:14:00:: .
And both in their objectives---objective%1:09:00:: of non-discrimination---non-discrimination%1:07:00:: and of social progress---progress%1:04:01:: they have had ranged against them the Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: who are called Bourbons---bourbon%1:18:01:: .
The name---name%1:10:00:: presumably derives from the French royal house---royal_house%1:14:00:: which never learned and never forgot ; since Bourbon---bourbon%1:13:00:: whiskey---whiskey%1:13:00:: , though of Kentucky---kentucky%1:15:00:: origin---origin%1:15:00:: , is at least as much favored by liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: in the North---north%1:15:02:: as by conservatives---conservative%1:18:00:: in the South---south%1:15:01:: .
The nature---nature%1:07:02:: of the opposition---opposition%1:24:02:: between liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: and Bourbons---bourbon%1:18:01:: is too little understood in the North---north%1:15:02:: .
The race problem---race_problem%1:26:00:: has tended to obscure other , less emotional , issues---issue%1:09:01:: which may fundamentally be even more divisive .
It is these other differences---difference%1:07:00:: between North---north%1:15:02:: and South---south%1:15:01:: - other , that is , than those which concern discrimination---discrimination%1:04:00:: or social welfare---social_welfare%1:04:00:: - which I chiefly discuss herein .
I write about Northern liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: from considerable personal experience---experience%1:09:01:: .
A Southerner---southerner%1:18:00:: married to a New Englander---new_englander%1:18:00:: , I have lived for many years---year%1:28:01:: in a Connecticut---connecticut%1:15:00:: commuting---commuting%1:04:00:: town---town%1:15:00:: with a high percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of artists---artist%1:18:00:: , writers---writer%1:18:00:: , publicity men---publicity_man%1:18:00:: , and business executives---business_executive%1:18:00:: of egghead---egghead%1:18:00:: tastes---taste%1:12:02:: .
Most of them are Democrats---democrat%1:18:01:: and nearly all consider themselves , and are viewed as , liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: .
This is puzzling to an outsider---outsider%1:18:00:: conscious of the classic tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: of liberalism---liberalism%1:09:01:: , because it is clear that these Democrats---democrat%1:18:01:: who are left-of-center are at opposite poles---pole%1:09:00:: from the liberal Jefferson---person%1:03:00:: , who held that the best government---government%1:04:00:: was the least government---government%1:04:00:: .
Yet paradoxically my liberal friends---friend%1:18:00:: continue to view Jefferson---person%1:03:00:: as one of their patron saints---patron_saint%1:18:00:: .
When I question them as to what they mean by concepts---concept%1:09:00:: like liberty---liberty%1:26:01:: and democracy---democracy%1:09:00:: , I find that they fall into two categories---category%1:14:00:: : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths---shibboleth%1:10:01:: of their faith---faith%1:09:01:: without analysis---analysis%1:09:00:: ; and the intelligent , cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things---thing%1:09:02:: do n't count any more in the world---world%1:09:00:: of to-day---today%1:28:00:: .
I am naive , they say , to make use---use%1:04:00:: of such words---word%1:10:00:: .
- liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: considers that the need---need%1:26:00:: for a national economy---economy%1:14:00:: with controls---control%1:24:00:: that will assure his conception---conception%1:09:00:: of social justice---justice%1:07:00:: is so great that individual and local liberties---liberty%1:26:01:: as well as democratic processes---process%1:04:00:: may have to yield before it .
This seems like an attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: favoring a sort---sort%1:09:00:: of totalitarian bureaucracy---bureaucracy%1:14:00:: which , under a President---president%1:18:00:: of the same stamp---stamp%1:14:00:: , would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress---congress%1:14:01:: or Supreme Court---supreme_court%1:14:00:: .
As for states---state%1:15:01:: ' rights---right%1:07:00:: , they have never counted in the thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: of my liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: friends---friend%1:18:00:: except as irritations---irritation%1:26:00:: of a minor and immoral nature---nature%1:07:02:: which exist now only as anachronisms---anachronism%1:28:00:: .
The American liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: may , in the world---world%1:09:00:: of to-day---today%1:28:00:: , have a strong case---case%1:10:01:: ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy---hypocrisy%1:10:00:: that it is not an honest one .
Why , in the first place , call himself a liberal---liberal%1:18:01:: if he is against laissez-faire---laissez_faire%1:09:00:: and favors an authoritarian central government---government%1:14:00:: with womb-to-tomb controls---control%1:24:00:: over everybody ?
If he attaches little importance---importance%1:07:00:: to personal liberty---liberty%1:26:01:: , why not make this known to the world---world%1:14:02:: ?
And if he is so scornful of the rights---right%1:07:00:: of states---state%1:15:01:: , why not advocate a different sort---sort%1:09:00:: of constitution---constitution%1:10:00:: that he could more sincerely support ?
I am concerned here , however , with the Northern liberal---liberal%1:18:00:: 's attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: toward the South---south%1:15:01:: .
It appears to be one of intense dislike---dislike%1:09:00:: , which he makes little effort---effort%1:04:00:: to conceal even in the presence---presence%1:15:00:: of Southern friends---friend%1:18:00:: .
His assumption---assumption%1:09:00:: seems to be that any such friends---friend%1:18:00:: , being tolerable humans , must be more liberal than most Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views---view%1:09:04:: .
Time---group%1:03:00:: 's editor---editor%1:18:00:: , Thomas Griffith---person%1:03:00:: , in his book---book%1:10:00:: , The Waist---waist%1:08:00:: High Culture---culture%1:14:00:: , wrote : `` most of what was different about it ( the Deep South---deep_south%1:15:00:: ) I found myself unsympathetic to '' .
This , for the liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: I know , would be an understatement---understatement%1:10:00:: .
Theirs is no mere lack---lack%1:26:00:: of sympathy---sympathy%1:09:00:: , but something closer to the passionate hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: that was directed against Fascism---fascism%1:09:00:: .
I do not think that my experience---experience%1:09:00:: would be typical for Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: living in the North---north%1:15:02:: .
In business---business%1:14:00:: circles---circle%1:14:00:: , usually conservative , this sort---sort%1:09:00:: of atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: would hardly be found .
But in our case---case%1:26:00:: - and neither my wife---wife%1:18:00:: nor I have extreme views---view%1:09:04:: on integration---integration%1:04:00:: , nor are we given to emotional outbursts---outburst%1:10:00:: - the situation---situation%1:26:00:: has ruined one or two valued friendships---friendship%1:26:00:: and come close to wrecking several more .
In fact it has caused us to give serious thought---thought%1:09:00:: to moving our residence---residence%1:15:00:: south , because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner---southerner%1:18:00:: to sit calmly by when his host---host%1:18:02:: is telling a roomful---roomful%1:23:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: that the only way---way%1:04:01:: to deal with Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: who oppose integration---integration%1:04:00:: is to send in troops---troops%1:14:00:: and shoot the bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: down .
Accounts---account%1:10:03:: have been published of Northern liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: in the South---south%1:15:01:: up against segregationist---segregationist%1:18:00:: prejudice---prejudice%1:09:01:: , especially in state-supported universities---university%1:06:00:: where pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: may be strong to uphold the majority---majority%1:07:00:: view---view%1:09:04:: .
But these accounts---account%1:10:03:: do not show that Northerners---northerner%1:18:00:: have been subjected to embarrassment---embarrassment%1:12:00:: or provocation---provocation%1:04:00:: by Yankee hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: displayed in social gatherings---gathering%1:04:00:: .
From my wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's experience---experience%1:09:00:: and other sources---source%1:18:01:: , this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles---circle%1:14:00:: .
The strong feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: is certainly there ; but there is a leavening---leavening%1:09:00:: of liberalism---liberalism%1:09:00:: among college---college%1:14:00:: graduates---graduate%1:18:00:: throughout the South---south%1:15:01:: , especially among those who studied in the North---north%1:15:02:: .
And social relations---social_relation%1:03:00:: arising out of business---business%1:04:01:: ties---tie%1:26:01:: impose courtesy---courtesy%1:04:00:: , if not sympathy---sympathy%1:12:00:: , toward resident and visiting Northerners---northerner%1:18:00:: .
Also , among the latter a large percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: on most social problems---problem%1:10:00:: .
There are of course many Souths---south%1:15:01:: ; but for this discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: the most important division---division%1:10:00:: is between those who have been reconstructed and those who have n't .
My definition---definition%1:10:00:: of this much abused adjective---adjective%1:10:00:: is that a reconstructed rebel---rebel%1:18:02:: is one who is glad that the North---north%1:15:01:: won the War---war%1:04:00:: .
Nobody knows how many Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: there are in this category---category%1:14:00:: .
I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North---north%1:15:02:: likes to believe .
I never heard of a poll---poll%1:09:00:: being taken on the question---question%1:10:01:: .
No doubt such a thing---thing%1:04:00:: would be considered unpatriotic .
Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority---majority%1:07:00:: of Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: would have voted against the Confederacy---confederacy%1:15:00:: .
Since the Supreme Court---supreme_court%1:14:00:: 's decision---decision%1:04:00:: of that year---year%1:28:01:: this is more doubtful ; and if a poll---poll%1:09:00:: had been taken immediately following the dispatch---dispatch%1:04:00:: of troops---troops%1:14:00:: to Little Rock---little_rock%1:15:00:: I believe the majority---majority%1:07:00:: would have been for the Old South---old_south%1:15:00:: .
Belief---belief%1:09:00:: in the traditional way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: persists much more in the older states---state%1:15:01:: than in the new ones .
Probably a larger percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of Virginians---virginian%1:18:00:: and South Carolinians---south_carolinian%1:18:00:: remain unreconstructed than elsewhere , with Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: , North Carolina---north_carolina%1:15:00:: , and Alabama---alabama%1:15:00:: following along after them .
Old attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater---tidewater%1:15:00:: than the Piedmont---piedmont%1:15:01:: ; so that a line---line%1:15:00:: running down the length---length%1:07:00:: of the South---south%1:15:01:: marking the upper limits---upper_limit%1:15:00:: of tidewater---tidewater%1:17:00:: would roughly divide the Old South---old_south%1:15:00:: from the new , but with , of course , important minority---minority%1:14:00:: enclaves---enclave%1:15:00:: .
The long settled areas---area%1:15:01:: of states---state%1:15:01:: like Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: and South Carolina---south_carolina%1:15:00:: developed the ante-bellum culture---culture%1:14:00:: to its richest flowering---flowering%1:22:01:: , and there the memory---memory%1:09:02:: is more precious , and the consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: of loss---loss%1:07:00:: the greater .
Also , we should not even to-day---today%1:28:00:: discount the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that a region---region%1:15:00:: such as the coastal lowlands---lowland%1:17:00:: centering on Charleston---charleston%1:15:01:: had closer ties---tie%1:26:01:: with England---england%1:15:00:: and the West Indies---west_indies%1:15:00:: than with the North---north%1:15:02:: even after independence---independence%1:11:00:: .
The social and psychological consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: of this continue to affect the area---area%1:15:01:: .
In certain respects---respect%1:09:00:: defeat---defeat%1:11:00:: increased the persistent Anglophilia---anglophilia%1:12:00:: of the Old South---old_south%1:15:00:: .
Poor where they had once been rich , humbled where they had been arrogant , having no longer any hope---hope%1:09:00:: of sharing in the leadership---leadership%1:26:00:: of the nation---nation%1:14:00:: , the rebels---rebel%1:18:00:: who would not surrender in spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: drew comfort---comfort%1:04:00:: from the sympathy---sympathy%1:12:00:: they felt extended to them by the mother country---mother_country%1:15:00:: .
And no doubt many people---people%1:14:00:: in states---state%1:15:01:: like the Carolinas---location%1:03:00:: and Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: , which were among the most Tory---tory%1:18:01:: in sentiment---sentiment%1:09:00:: in the eighteenth century---century%1:28:00:: , bitterly regretted the revolt---revolt%1:04:00:: against the Crown---crown%1:10:01:: .
Among Bourbons---bourbon%1:18:01:: the racial issue---issue%1:09:01:: may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors---factor%1:11:00:: .
All Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: agree that slavery---slavery%1:26:00:: had to go ; but many historians---historian%1:18:00:: maintain that except for Northern meddling---meddling%1:04:00:: it would have ended in states---state%1:15:01:: like Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: years---year%1:28:01:: before it did .
Southern resentment---resentment%1:12:00:: has been over the method---method%1:09:00:: of its ending---ending%1:04:00:: , the invasion---invasion%1:04:00:: , and Reconstruction---reconstruction%1:28:00:: ; their fears---fear%1:12:00:: now are of miscegenation---miscegenation%1:04:00:: and Negro political control---control%1:26:00:: in many counties---county%1:15:00:: .
But apart from racial problems---problem%1:10:00:: , the old unreconstructed South---south%1:15:01:: - to use the moderate words---word%1:10:00:: favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith---person%1:03:00:: - finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: of the North---north%1:15:02:: .
And this , in effect , means most of modern America---america%1:15:00:: .
It is hard to see how the situation---situation%1:26:00:: could be otherwise .
And therein , I feel , many Northerners---northerner%1:18:00:: delude themselves about the South---south%1:15:01:: .
For one thing , this is not a subject---subject%1:10:00:: often discussed or analyzed .
There seems to be almost a conspiracy---conspiracy%1:09:00:: of silence---silence%1:07:01:: veiling it .
I suppose the reason---reason%1:10:01:: is a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of wishful thinking---wishful_thinking%1:09:00:: : do n't talk about the final stages---stage%1:26:00:: of Reconstruction---reconstruction%1:28:00:: and they will take care of themselves .
Or else the North---north%1:15:02:: really believes that all Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: except a few quaint old characters---character%1:18:00:: have come around to realizing the errors---error%1:04:02:: of their past---past%1:28:00:: , and are now at heart sharers---sharer%1:18:00:: of the American Dream---american_dream%1:12:00:: , like everybody else .
If the circumstances---circumstance%1:26:02:: are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true .
The situation---situation%1:26:00:: of the South---south%1:15:01:: since 1865 has been unique in the western world---world%1:14:01:: .
Regardless of rights---right%1:07:01:: and wrongs---wrong%1:07:01:: , a population---population%1:14:00:: and an area---area%1:15:01:: appropriate to a pre World War I---world_war_i%1:04:00:: , great power---great_power%1:14:00:: have been , following conquest---conquest%1:04:01:: , ruled against their will---will%1:09:00:: by a neighboring people---people%1:14:00:: , and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls---control%1:24:00:: they dislike---dislike%1:09:00:: .
And the great majority---majority%1:07:00:: of these people---people%1:14:00:: are of Anglo-Saxon---anglo-saxon%1:18:00:: or Celtic descent---descent%1:07:00:: .
This is the only case---case%1:11:00:: in modern history---history%1:28:00:: of a people of Britannic origin---origin%1:07:00:: submitting without continued struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: to what they view as foreign domination---domination%1:04:00:: .
The fact---fact%1:09:01:: is due mainly to international wars---war%1:04:00:: , both hot---hot_war%1:26:00:: and cold---cold_war%1:26:00:: .
In every war---war%1:04:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: since the Civil War---civil_war%1:04:00:: the South---south%1:15:01:: was more belligerent than the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the country---country%1:15:00:: .
So instead of being tests---test%1:09:02:: of the South---south%1:15:01:: 's loyalty---loyalty%1:07:00:: , the Spanish War---spanish-american_war%1:04:00:: , the two World Wars---world_war%1:04:00:: , and the Korean War---korean_war%1:04:00:: all served to overcome old grievances---grievance%1:12:00:: and cement reunion---reunion%1:04:00:: .
And there is no section---section%1:15:01:: of the nation more ardent than the South---south%1:15:01:: in the cold war---cold_war%1:26:00:: against Communism---communism%1:14:00:: .
Had the situation---situation%1:26:00:: been reversed , had , for instance , England---england%1:15:00:: been the enemy---enemy%1:14:01:: in 1898 because of issues---issue%1:09:01:: of concern---concern%1:09:00:: chiefly to New England---new_england%1:15:00:: , there is little doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: that large numbers---large_number%1:23:00:: of Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms---uniform%1:06:00:: to fight as allies---ally%1:18:00:: of Britain---britain%1:15:00:: .
It is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: should have been as docile as they have .
The North---north%1:15:02:: should thank its stars that such has been the case---case%1:09:00:: ; but at the same time it should not draw false inferences---inference%1:09:00:: therefrom .
The two main charges---charge%1:10:00:: levelled against the Bourbons---bourbon%1:18:01:: by liberals---liberal%1:18:00:: is that they are racists---racist%1:18:00:: and social reactionaries---reactionary%1:18:00:: .
There is much truth---truth%1:07:01:: in both these charges---charge%1:10:00:: , and not many Bourbons---bourbon%1:18:01:: deny them .
Whatever their faults---fault%1:26:00:: , they are not hypocrites---hypocrite%1:18:00:: .
Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-Saxon---anglo-saxon%1:18:00:: is the best race---race%1:14:00:: in the world and that it should remain pure .
Many Northerners---northerner%1:18:01:: believe this , too , but few of them will say so publicly .
The Bourbon---bourbon%1:18:01:: economic philosophy---philosophy%1:09:01:: , moreover , is not very different from that of Northern conservatives---conservative%1:18:00:: .
But those among the Bourbons---bourbon%1:18:01:: who remain unreconstructed go much further than this .
They believe that if the South---south%1:15:01:: had been let alone it would have produced a civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: superior to that of modern America---america%1:15:00:: .
As it is , they consider that the North---north%1:15:02:: is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism---egalitarianism%1:09:00:: , that in spite of its high standard of living---standard_of_living%1:26:00:: the `` American way---way%1:04:00:: '' has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways---way%1:04:00:: , although they disapprove of the socialistic features---feature%1:09:00:: of the latter .
The South---south%1:15:01:: 's antipathy---antipathy%1:12:00:: to Northern civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: includes such charges---charge%1:10:00:: as poor manners---manners%1:07:00:: , harsh accents---accent%1:10:01:: , lack---lack%1:26:00:: of appreciation---appreciation%1:09:00:: of the arts---art%1:09:00:: of living---living%1:09:00:: like gastronomy and the use---use%1:04:00:: of leisure---leisure%1:04:00:: .
Their own easier , slower tempo---tempo%1:28:00:: is especially dear to Southerners---southerner%1:18:00:: ; and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half---half%1:23:00:: or a third---third%1:23:00:: as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits---habit%1:09:00:: of their home town---hometown%1:15:00:: .
Mickie---person%1:03:00:: sat over his second whisky-on-the-rocks---whisky_on_the_rocks%1:13:00:: in a little bar---bar%1:06:04:: next to the funeral parlor---funeral_parlor%1:06:00:: on Pennsylvania Avenue---location%1:03:00:: .
Al 's Little Cafe---group%1:03:00:: was small , dark , narrow , and filled with the mingled scent---scent%1:09:01:: of beer---beer%1:13:00:: , tobacco---tobacco%1:06:00:: smoke---smoke%1:19:00:: , and Italian cooking .
Hanging over the bar---bar%1:06:04:: was an oil painting---oil_painting%1:06:00:: of a nude---nude%1:06:00:: Al---person%1:03:00:: had accepted from a student---student%1:18:00:: at the Corcoran Gallery---group%1:03:00:: who needed to eat and drink and was broke .
The nude---nude%1:06:00:: was small and black-haired and elfin , and was called `` Eloise---person%1:03:00:: '' .
This was one place---place%1:15:00:: where Moonan---person%1:03:00:: could go for a drink---drink%1:13:04:: in a back booth---booth%1:06:02:: without anyone noticing him , or at least coming up and hanging around and wanting to know all the low-down---low-down%1:10:00:: .
The other patrons---patron%1:18:00:: were taxi drivers---taxidriver%1:18:00:: and art students---art_student%1:18:00:: and small shopkeepers---shopkeeper%1:18:00:: .
The reporters---reporter%1:18:00:: had not yet discovered that this was his hideaway---hideaway%1:15:00:: .
His friend---friend%1:18:00:: Jane---person%1:03:00:: was with him .
She was wise enough to realize a man---man%1:18:00:: could be good company---company%1:18:00:: even if he did weigh too much and did n't own the mint---mint%1:23:00:: .
She was the widow---widow%1:18:00:: of a writer---writer%1:18:01:: who had died in an airplane---airplane%1:06:00:: crash---crash%1:11:00:: , and Mickie---person%1:03:00:: had found her a job---job%1:04:00:: as head---head%1:18:00:: of the historical section---section%1:09:00:: of the Treasury---group%1:03:00:: .
This meant sorting out press clippings---press_clipping%1:10:00:: and the like---the_like%1:09:00:: .
Jane---person%1:03:00:: sat receptive and interested .
Mickie---person%1:03:00:: had a pleasant glow---glow%1:26:00:: as he said , `` You see , both of them , I mean the President---president%1:18:00:: and Jeff Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: , are romantics---romantic%1:18:00:: .
A romantic---romantic%1:18:00:: is one who thinks the world---world%1:17:01:: is divinely inspired and all he has to do is find the right key---key%1:06:00:: , and then divine justice---justice%1:07:00:: and altruism---altruism%1:07:00:: will appear .
It 's like focusing a camera---camera%1:06:00:: ; the distant ship---ship%1:06:00:: is n't there until you get the focus---focus%1:07:01:: .
I'm sure all girls---girl%1:18:00:: feel this way---way%1:07:01:: about men---man%1:18:00:: until they live with them .
`` But when it comes to war---war%1:04:00:: , the Colonel---colonel%1:18:00:: knows what it is and Jeff---person%1:03:00:: does n't .
Mr. Christiansen---person%1:03:00:: knows that a soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: will get the Distinguished Service Medal---distinguished_service_medal%1:10:00:: for conduct---conduct%1:04:00:: that would land him in prison---prison%1:06:00:: for life---life%1:28:02:: or the electric chair---electric_chair%1:06:00:: as a civilian---civilian%1:18:00:: .
He had a mean , unbroken sheer bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: in his outfit---outfit%1:14:00:: , and someone---someone%1:03:00:: invented the name---name%1:10:00:: Trig---person%1:03:00:: for him .
He 'd shoot at anything if it was the rear end---rear_end%1:08:00:: of a horse---horse%1:05:00:: or his own sentry---sentry%1:18:00:: .
He was a wiry , inscrutable , silent country boy---boy%1:18:00:: from the red clay---red_clay%1:27:00:: of rural Alabama---alabama%1:15:00:: , and he spoke with the broad drawl---drawl%1:10:00:: that others normally make fun of .
But not in front of Trig---person%1:03:00:: .
I heard of some that tried it back in the States---location%1:03:00:: , and he 'd knock them clear across the room---room%1:06:00:: .
There 'd been a pretty bad incident---incident%1:11:00:: back at the Marine---marine%1:18:00:: base---base%1:06:04:: .
A New York---new_york%1:15:01:: kid---kid%1:18:00:: , a refugee---refugee%1:18:00:: from one of the Harlem---harlem%1:15:00:: gangs---gang%1:14:01:: , made fun of Trig---person%1:03:00:: 's accent---accent%1:10:01:: , and drew a knife---knife%1:06:01:: .
Before the fight---fight%1:04:02:: was over , the Harlem---harlem%1:15:00:: boy---boy%1:18:00:: had a concussion---concussion%1:11:00:: and Trig---person%1:03:00:: was cut up badly .
They caught Trig---person%1:03:00:: stealing liquor---liquor%1:13:00:: from the officers---officer%1:18:03:: ' mess---mess%1:06:00:: , and he got a couple of girls---girl%1:18:02:: in trouble .
The fear---fear%1:12:00:: of punishment---punishment%1:04:00:: just did n't bother him .
This is why he made such a magnificent soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: .
He was n't troubled with the ordinary , rank-and-file---rank_and_file%1:14:00:: fear---fear%1:12:00:: that overcomes and paralyzes and sends individual soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: and whole companies---company%1:14:03:: under fire running in panic---panic%1:12:00:: .
It just did n't occur to Trig---person%1:03:00:: that anything serious would happen to him .
Do you get the picture of the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of fellow---fellow%1:18:00:: he was '' ?
Jane---person%1:03:00:: nodded with a pleasant smile---smile%1:10:00:: .
There was a sniper---sniper%1:18:00:: 's nest---nest%1:06:00:: in a mountain cave---cave%1:17:00:: , and it was picking off our men---man%1:18:03:: with devilish accuracy---accuracy%1:07:02:: .
The Colonel---colonel%1:18:00:: ordered that it be wiped out , and I suggested , ' You ask for volunteers---volunteer%1:18:01:: , and promise each man---man%1:18:00:: on the patrol---patrol%1:14:00:: a quart---quart%1:23:01:: of whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: , ten dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: and a week-end---weekend%1:28:00:: pass---pass%1:28:00:: to Davao---location%1:03:00:: ' .
Trig---person%1:03:00:: was one---one%1:23:00:: of the five volunteers---volunteer%1:18:01:: .
The patrol---patrol%1:14:00:: snaked around in back of the cave---cave%1:17:00:: , approached it from above and dropped in suddenly with wild howls---howl%1:10:00:: .
You could hear them from our outpost---outpost%1:06:00:: .
There was a lot of shooting---shooting%1:04:01:: .
We knew the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: was subdued , because a flare---flare%1:10:00:: was fired as the signal---signal%1:10:00:: .
Two of our men---man%1:18:03:: were killed , a third was wounded .
Trig---person%1:03:00:: and a very black colored boy---boy%1:18:00:: from Detroit---detroit%1:15:00:: had killed or put out of action---action%1:04:03:: ten guerrillas---guerrilla%1:18:00:: by grenades---grenade%1:06:00:: and hand-to-hand fighting---fighting%1:04:00:: .
When we got there , Trig---person%1:03:00:: and the Negro---negro%1:18:00:: were quarreling over possession---possession%1:04:00:: of a gold crucifix---crucifix%1:06:00:: around the neck---neck%1:08:00:: of a wounded Filipino---filipino%1:18:00:: .
The colored boy---boy%1:18:00:: had it , and Trig---person%1:03:00:: lunged at him with a knife---knife%1:06:01:: and said , ' Give that to me , you black bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: .
We do n't ' low nigras---nigra%1:18:00:: to walk---walk%1:04:00:: on the same sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: with white men---white_man%1:18:00:: where I come from ' .
`` The Negro---negro%1:18:00:: got a bad slice---slice%1:26:00:: on his chest---chest%1:08:00:: from the knife---knife%1:06:01:: wound---wound%1:26:00:: '' .
`` What did the Colonel---colonel%1:18:00:: do about the men---man%1:18:03:: '' ?
Jane---person%1:03:00:: asked in her placid , interested way---way%1:04:00:: .
Mickie---person%1:03:00:: laughed .
`` He recommended both of them for the DSM and the Detroit---detroit%1:15:00:: fellow---fellow%1:18:00:: for the Purple Heart---purple_heart%1:10:00:: , too , for a combat---combat%1:04:00:: inflicted wound---wound%1:11:00:: .
So you see Mr. Christiansen---person%1:03:00:: knows what it 's all about .
But not Jeff Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: .
When he was in the war---war%1:04:00:: , he was in Law---law%1:04:00:: or Supplies or something like that , and an old buddy---buddy%1:18:00:: of his told me he would come down on Sundays---sunday%1:28:00:: to the Pentagon---pentagon%1:06:00:: and read the citations---citation%1:10:00:: for medals---medal%1:10:00:: - just like the one we sent in for Trig---person%1:03:00:: - and go away with a real glow---glow%1:26:00:: .
These were heroes---hero%1:18:00:: nine feet---foot%1:23:00:: tall to him '' .
Jefferson Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: was alone at the small , perfectly appointed table---table%1:06:02:: by the window---window%1:06:00:: looking out over the river---river%1:17:00:: .
He had dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: and sat there over his coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: watching the winding pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: of traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: as it crossed the bridge---bridge%1:06:00:: and spread out like a serpent---serpent%1:05:00:: with two heads---head%1:08:00:: .
Open beside him was Mrs. Dalloway---person%1:03:00:: .
He thought how this dainty , fragile older woman---woman%1:18:00:: threading her way---way%1:23:00:: through the streets---street%1:06:00:: of Westminster---location%1:03:00:: on a day---day%1:28:01:: in June---june%1:28:00:: , enjoying the flowers---flower%1:20:00:: in the shops---shop%1:06:00:: , the greetings---greeting%1:10:00:: from old friends---friend%1:18:00:: , but never really drawing a deep , passionate breath---breath%1:04:00:: , was so like himself .
He , and Mrs. Dalloway---person%1:03:00:: , too , had never permitted themselves the luxury---luxury%1:07:01:: of joys---joy%1:09:00:: that dug into the bone marrow---bone_marrow%1:08:00:: of the spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: .
Poverty---poverty%1:26:00:: imposes a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of chastity---chastity%1:04:00:: on the ambitious .
They cannot stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat---seat%1:06:01:: of cars---car%1:06:00:: along a dark country lane---lane%1:06:00:: .
No---no%1:10:00:: , they must look the other way and climb one more painful step---step%1:23:00:: up the ladder---ladder%1:06:00:: .
He made the decision---decision%1:04:00:: with his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: open , or so he thought .
At any cost---cost%1:07:01:: , he must leave the dreary Pennsylvania---pennsylvania%1:15:00:: mining---mining%1:04:00:: town---town%1:15:00:: where his father---father%1:18:00:: was a pharmacist---pharmacist%1:18:00:: .
At State College---group%1:03:00:: , he had no time---time%1:28:05:: to walk---walk%1:04:00:: among the violets---violet%1:20:00:: on the water 's edge---edge%1:15:00:: .
From his room---room%1:23:00:: he could look out in springtime---springtime%1:28:00:: and see the couples---couple%1:14:00:: hand in hand walking slowly , deliciously , across the campus---campus%1:15:00:: , and he could smell the sweet vernal winds---wind%1:19:00:: .
He was not stone---stone%1:27:00:: .
He had to teach himself patiently that these traps---trap%1:06:00:: were not for him .
He must mentally pull the blinds---blind%1:06:00:: and close the window---window%1:06:00:: , so that all that existed was in the books---book%1:06:00:: before him .
At law school---law_school%1:14:00:: , the same .
More of this stamping down of human emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: as a young lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: in New York---new_york%1:15:00:: .
By the time---time%1:11:00:: he was prosperous enough - his goals---goal%1:09:00:: were high - he was bald and afraid of women---woman%1:18:00:: .
The only one who would have him was his cripple---cripple%1:18:00:: , the strange unhappy woman---woman%1:18:00:: who became his wife---wife%1:18:00:: .
He had dared to defy nature , to turn his back---back%1:08:00:: to the Lorelei---lorelei%1:18:00:: , and he was punished .
Like Mrs. Dalloway---person%1:03:00:: , with her regrets---regret%1:12:00:: about Peter Walsh---person%1:03:00:: , he had his moments---moment%1:28:01:: of melancholy---melancholy%1:12:00:: over a youth---youth%1:28:00:: too well spent .
If he had had a son---son%1:18:00:: , he would tell him , `` Gather ye rosebuds---rosebud%1:20:00:: while ye may .
This same flower---flower%1:20:00:: that smiles today---today%1:28:00:: tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:00:: will be dying '' .
But then his son---son%1:18:00:: could afford it .
Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: was waiting for Bill Boxell---person%1:03:00:: .
The Vice President---vice_president%1:18:00:: had called and asked if he could see the Secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: at his home---home%1:15:04:: .
He said the matter---matter%1:09:01:: was urgent .
The Secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: was uneasy about the visit---visit%1:14:00:: .
He did not like Boxell---person%1:03:00:: .
Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: could not put his finger---finger%1:08:00:: on it precisely , and this worried him .
When you disliked or distrusted a man---man%1:18:00:: , you should have a reason---reason%1:16:00:: .
Human nature---nature%1:07:02:: was not a piece---piece%1:13:00:: of meat---meat%1:13:01:: you could tell was bad by its smell---smell%1:07:00:: .
Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: stared a minute---minute%1:28:00:: at the lighted ribbon---ribbon%1:17:00:: of traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: , hoping that a clue---clue%1:10:00:: to his dislike---dislike%1:09:00:: of the Vice President---vice_president%1:18:00:: would appear .
Therefore , he decided he was unfair to the young man---young_man%1:18:01:: and should make an effort---effort%1:04:00:: to understand and sympathize with his point of view---point_of_view%1:09:00:: .
A half hour---half-hour%1:28:00:: later the Vice President---vice_president%1:18:00:: arrived .
He looked very carefully at every piece---piece%1:06:05:: of furnishing , as though hoping to store this information---information%1:09:00:: carefully in his mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
He observed the Florentine vase---vase%1:06:00:: in the hall---hall%1:06:05:: , the Renoir---person%1:03:00:: painting---painting%1:04:00:: in the library---library%1:06:01:: , as well as the long shelves---shelf%1:06:00:: of well-bound volumes---volume%1:06:00:: ; the pattern---pattern%1:06:00:: of the Oriental rug---rug%1:06:00:: , the delicate cut-glass---cut_glass%1:06:00:: chandelier---chandelier%1:06:00:: .
He said to the Secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: , `` I understand you came from a little Pennsylvania---pennsylvania%1:15:00:: town---town%1:15:00:: near Wilkes-Barre---location%1:03:00:: .
He waved his arm---arm%1:08:00:: around at the furnishings .
It was not a discourteous question---question%1:10:00:: , Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: decided .
This young man---young_man%1:18:01:: had so little time---time%1:28:05:: to learn he had to be curious ; he had to find out .
The Secretary---secretary%1:18:01:: did not tell him at what cost---cost%1:07:01:: , at what loneliness---loneliness%1:12:00:: , he learned these things---thing%1:09:00:: .
He merely said , `` Any good decorator---decorator%1:18:00:: these days---day%1:28:03:: can make you a tasteful home---home%1:06:00:: '' .
The Vice President---vice_president%1:18:00:: said , `` If you hear of any names---name%1:10:00:: that would fix me cheap in return for advertising---advertising%1:10:00:: they decorated the Vice President---vice_president%1:18:00:: 's home---home%1:06:00:: , let me know .
I can do business---business%1:04:01:: with that kind---kind%1:09:00:: '' .
Again , Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: thought a little sadly , these were the fees---fee%1:21:00:: of poverty---poverty%1:26:00:: and ambition---ambition%1:07:00:: .
Boxell---person%1:03:00:: did not have the chance---chance%1:19:00:: to grow up graciously .
He had to acquire everything he was going to get in four years---year%1:28:01:: .
They had brandy---brandy%1:13:00:: in the library---library%1:06:01:: .
Boxell---person%1:03:00:: looked at Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: with a searching glance---glance%1:04:00:: , the kind---kind%1:09:00:: that a prosecuting attorney---prosecuting_attorney%1:18:00:: would give a man---man%1:18:00:: on trial .
What are your weaknesses---weakness%1:26:00:: ?
How best to destroy your peace---peace%1:26:00:: ?
The Vice President---vice_president%1:18:00:: said with a slight bluster---bluster%1:10:00:: , `` There is n't anyone who loves the President---president%1:18:00:: more than I do .
Old Chris---person%1:03:00:: is my ideal---ideal%1:18:00:: .
At the same time , you have to face facts---fact%1:10:01:: and realize that a man---man%1:18:00:: who 's been in the Marine Corps---marine_corps%1:14:00:: all his life---life%1:28:01:: does n't understand much about politics---politics%1:24:00:: .
What does a monk---monk%1:18:00:: know about sex---sex%1:04:00:: '' ?
Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: listened with the practiced , deceptive calm---calm%1:07:00:: of the lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: , but his face---face%1:07:00:: was in the shadow---shadow%1:26:01:: .
`` So , we have to protect the old man---old_man%1:18:02:: for his own good---good%1:07:01:: .
Congress---group%1:03:00:: is full of politicians---politician%1:18:01:: , and if you want to get along with them , you have to be politic .
This is why I say we just can't go ahead and disarm the Germans---german%1:18:00:: and pull down our own defenses---defense%1:04:00:: .
Let me tell you what happened to me today---today%1:28:00:: .
A fellow---fellow%1:18:00:: came up to me , a Senator---person%1:03:00:: , I do n't have to tell you his name---name%1:10:00:: , and he told me , ' I love the President---president%1:18:00:: like a brother---brother%1:18:00:: , but God damn it , he 's crucifying me .
I 've got a quarter---quarter%1:23:01:: of a million Germans---german%1:18:00:: in my state---state%1:15:01:: , and those krautheads---krauthead%1:18:00:: tune in on Father Werther---person%1:03:00:: every night , and if he tells them to go out and piss in the public square---public_square%1:15:00:: , that 's what they do .
He 's telling them now to write letters---letter%1:10:00:: to their Congressmen---congressman%1:18:00:: opposing the disarmament---disarmament%1:04:00:: of Germany---germany%1:15:00:: ' .
And another one comes to me and he says , ' Look here , there 's a mill---mill%1:06:01:: in my state---state%1:15:01:: employs five thousand people---people%1:14:00:: making uniforms---uniform%1:06:00:: for the Navy---navy%1:14:00:: .

A 5 - percent---percent%1:24:00:: royalty---royalty%1:21:00:: is paid on any production---production%1:06:00:: during the period---period%1:28:00:: the contract---contract%1:10:00:: is in effect ; if the Government---government%1:04:00:: certifies that production---production%1:04:00:: may be possible from the property---property%1:21:00:: , the royalty---royalty%1:21:00:: obligation---obligation%1:04:00:: continues for the 10 - year---year%1:28:01:: period---period%1:28:00:: usually specified in the contract---contract%1:10:00:: or until the Government---government%1:14:00:: 's contribution---contribution%1:21:01:: is repaid with interest---interest%1:21:00:: .
The royalty---royalty%1:21:00:: applies to both principal---principal%1:21:01:: and interest---interest%1:21:00:: , but it never exceeds 5 percent---percent%1:24:00:: .
Information---information%1:10:00:: , application forms---application_form%1:10:00:: , and assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: in filing may be obtained from the Office of Minerals Exploration---group%1:03:00:: , U.S. Department of the Interior---group%1:03:00:: , Washington---washington%1:15:01:: 25 , D.C.---district_of_columbia%1:15:00:: , or from the appropriate regional office---office%1:14:01:: listed below :
Some of the features---feature%1:09:00:: of the top portions---portion%1:24:00:: of Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 1 and Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 were mentioned in discussing Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 .
First , the Onset---onset%1:11:00:: Profile---profile%1:10:01:: spreads across approximately 12 years---year%1:28:01:: for boys---boy%1:18:00:: and 10 years---year%1:28:01:: for girls---girl%1:18:02:: .
In contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: , 20 of the 21 lines---line%1:10:01:: in the Completion Profile---profile%1:10:01:: ( excluding center---center%1:15:01:: 5 for boys---boy%1:18:00:: and 4 for girls---girl%1:18:02:: ) are bunched and extend over a much shorter period---period%1:28:00:: , approximately 30 months---month%1:28:00:: for boys---boy%1:18:00:: and 40 months---month%1:28:00:: for girls---girl%1:18:02:: .
The Maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: Chart---chart%1:10:00:: for each sex---sex%1:14:00:: demonstrates clearly that Onset---onset%1:11:00:: is a phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: of infancy---infancy%1:28:00:: and early childhood---early_childhood%1:28:00:: whereas Completion is a phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: of the later portion---portion%1:24:00:: of adolescence---adolescence%1:28:00:: .
Second , for both sexes---sex%1:14:00:: , the 21 transverse lines---line%1:10:01:: in the Onset---onset%1:11:00:: Profile---profile%1:10:01:: vary more in individual spread---spread%1:07:02:: than those in the Completion Profile---profile%1:10:01:: .
Although the standard deviation---standard_deviation%1:09:00:: values---value%1:09:00:: on which spread---spread%1:07:02:: of the lines---line%1:10:01:: are based are relatively larger for those centers---center%1:15:01:: which begin to ossify early ( Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 ) , there are considerable differences in this value---value%1:09:00:: between centers---center%1:15:01:: having the closely timed Onsets---onset%1:11:00:: .
Third , the process of calcification---calcification%1:22:00:: is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys---boy%1:18:00:: than for the girls---girl%1:18:02:: , a fact---fact%1:10:01:: which confirms data---data%1:14:00:: for other groups---group%1:03:00:: of children---child%1:18:00:: .
The Onset---onset%1:11:00:: Profile---profile%1:10:01:: and Completion Profile---profile%1:10:01:: are constructed to serve as norms---norm%1:24:00:: for children---child%1:18:00:: .
It is convenient to classify a child---child%1:18:00:: 's onset---onset%1:11:00:: ages---age%1:07:00:: and completion ages---age%1:07:00:: as `` advanced '' , `` moderate '' ( modal ) , or `` delayed '' according to whether the child---child%1:18:00:: 's age---age%1:07:00:: equivalent---equivalent%1:09:00:: `` dots---dot%1:25:00:: '' appeared to the left---left%1:15:00:: of , upon , or to the right---right%1:07:00:: of the appropriate short transverse line---line%1:10:01:: .
When a dot---dot%1:25:00:: appears close to the end---end%1:15:00:: of the transverse line---line%1:10:01:: , the `` moderate '' rating---rating%1:09:00:: may be further classified according to the position---position%1:07:00:: of the dot---dot%1:25:00:: with respect to the vertical marking---marking%1:10:00:: denoting the mean age---age%1:07:00:: .
Such classifications---classification%1:14:00:: may be called `` somewhat advanced '' or `` somewhat delayed '' , as the case---case%1:26:00:: may be , reserving `` moderate '' for dots---dot%1:25:00:: upon or close to the mean---mean%1:09:00:: .
In the lower portion---portion%1:24:00:: of each Chart---chart%1:10:00:: , the Skeletal Age---age%1:07:00:: ( Hand---hand%1:08:00:: ) of boy---boy%1:18:00:: 34 and girl---girl%1:18:02:: 2 may be similarly classified .
There the middle one of the three curves---curve%1:10:00:: denotes `` mean Skeletal Age---age%1:07:00:: '' for the Maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: Series---series%1:14:00:: boys---boy%1:18:00:: and girls---girl%1:18:02:: .
The upper curve---curve%1:10:00:: denotes the mean---mean%1:09:00:: plus one standard deviation---standard_deviation%1:09:00:: , and the lower curve---curve%1:10:00:: represents the mean---mean%1:09:00:: minus one standard deviation---standard_deviation%1:09:00:: .
Thus , a child---child%1:18:00:: 's Skeletal Age---age%1:07:00:: `` dots---dot%1:25:00:: '' may be classified as `` advanced '' when they appear above the middle curve---curve%1:10:00:: , `` moderate '' when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve---curve%1:10:00:: , and `` delayed '' when they appear below the lower curve---curve%1:10:00:: .
To summarize the purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: of the Skeletal Maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: Chart---chart%1:10:00:: : each contains two kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of skeletal maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: norms---norm%1:24:00:: which show two quite different methods---method%1:09:00:: of depicting developmental level---level%1:07:00:: of growth---growth%1:22:00:: centers---center%1:15:01:: .
First , the upper portion---portion%1:24:00:: requires series---series%1:14:00:: of films---film%1:06:01:: for every child---child%1:18:00:: , consisting of those from Hand---hand%1:08:00:: , Elbow---elbow%1:08:00:: , Shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: , Knee---knee%1:08:00:: , and Foot---foot%1:08:01:: .
The lower portion---portion%1:24:00:: necessitates only films---film%1:06:01:: of Hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
Second , the upper portion---portion%1:24:00:: permits comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: of maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: levels---level%1:07:00:: of an equal number---number%1:07:00:: of growth---growth%1:22:00:: centers---center%1:15:01:: from the long---long_bone%1:08:00:: , short---short_bone%1:08:00:: , and round bones---round_bone%1:08:00:: of the five regions---region%1:08:00:: .
The lower portion---portion%1:24:00:: permits comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: of maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: levels---level%1:07:00:: of short---short_bone%1:08:00:: and round bones---round_bone%1:08:00:: predominantly , since only two long bones---long_bone%1:08:00:: are included in Hand---hand%1:08:00:: and Wrist---wrist%1:08:00:: as a region---region%1:08:00:: .
Third , the upper portion---portion%1:24:00:: deals with only two indicators---indicator%1:10:00:: of developmental level---level%1:07:00:: , Onset---onset%1:11:00:: and Completion .
The lower portion---portion%1:24:00:: utilizes the full complement---full_complement%1:14:00:: of intermediate maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: indicators---indicator%1:10:00:: of each Hand---hand%1:08:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: as well as their Onset---onset%1:11:00:: and Completion .
Fourth , the two indicators---indicator%1:10:00:: are for the most part widely separated chronologically , with the extensive age---age%1:07:00:: gap---gap%1:07:00:: occurring during childhood---childhood%1:26:00:: for all but one growth---growth%1:22:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: .
The lower portion---portion%1:24:00:: provides a rating---rating%1:09:00:: at any stage---stage%1:26:00:: between infancy---infancy%1:28:00:: and adulthood---adulthood%1:28:00:: .
Onsets---onset%1:11:00:: , Completions , and Skeletal Ages---age%1:07:00:: ( Hand---hand%1:08:00:: ) of boy---boy%1:18:00:: 34 and girl---girl%1:18:02:: 2 may be directly compared and classified , using only those Skeletal Ages---age%1:07:00:: which appear immediately below the Onset---onset%1:11:00:: Profile---profile%1:10:01:: and the Completion Profile---profile%1:10:01:: .
It may be assumed that differences---difference%1:07:00:: in ratings---rating%1:09:00:: due to selection---selection%1:04:00:: of growth---growth%1:22:00:: centers---center%1:15:01:: from specific regions---region%1:08:00:: of the body---body%1:08:00:: will be small , according to existing tables---table%1:14:00:: of onset---onset%1:11:00:: age---age%1:07:00:: and completion age---age%1:07:00:: for centers---center%1:15:01:: throughout the body---body%1:08:00:: .
Accordingly , maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: level---level%1:07:00:: ratings---rating%1:09:00:: by means---means%1:04:00:: of the upper portion---portion%1:24:00:: and lower portion---portion%1:24:00:: of the Chart---chart%1:10:00:: , respectively , should be somewhat similar since Skeletal Age---age%1:07:00:: assessments---assessment%1:09:00:: are dependent upon Onsets---onset%1:11:00:: during infancy---infancy%1:28:00:: and upon Completions during adolescence---adolescence%1:28:00:: .
It is clear that there are some differences---difference%1:07:00:: in the ratings---rating%1:09:00:: , but there is substantial agreement---agreement%1:07:00:: .
Since a Skeletal Age---age%1:07:00:: rating---rating%1:09:00:: can be made at any age---age%1:07:00:: during growth---growth%1:22:00:: , from Elbow---elbow%1:08:00:: , Shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: , Knee---knee%1:08:00:: , or Foot---foot%1:08:01:: as well as Hand---hand%1:08:00:: , it seems to be the method of choice---method_of_choice%1:09:00:: when one wishes to study most aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: of skeletal developmental progress---progress%1:04:01:: during childhood---childhood%1:26:00:: .
As stated earlier in the paper---paper%1:10:01:: , Onsets---onset%1:11:00:: and Completions - particularly the former - provide a different tool---tool%1:04:00:: or indicator---indicator%1:10:00:: of expectancy---expectancy%1:09:00:: in osseous development---development%1:22:01:: , each within a limited age---age%1:07:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: .
Such an indicator---indicator%1:10:00:: , or indicators---indicator%1:10:00:: , are needed as means---means%1:04:00:: of recognizing specific periods---period%1:28:00:: of delay---delay%1:04:00:: in skeletal developmental progress---progress%1:04:01:: .
It was stated earlier that one purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of this study---study%1:04:00:: was to extend the analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of variability---variability%1:07:00:: of Onset---onset%1:11:00:: and Completion in each of the 21 growth---growth%1:22:00:: centers---center%1:15:01:: somewhat beyond that provided by the data---data%1:14:00:: in Tables---table%1:14:00:: 1 and 2 .
As one approach---approach%1:04:02:: to doing this , Figures---figure%1:10:00:: 3 and 4 have been constructed from the mean ages---age%1:07:00:: and the individual onset---onset%1:11:00:: and completion ages---age%1:07:00:: for boy---boy%1:18:00:: 34 and girl---girl%1:18:02:: 2 .
The differences between onset---onset%1:11:00:: age---age%1:07:00:: and completion age---age%1:07:00:: with respect to the corresponding mean age---age%1:07:00:: have been brought into juxtaposition---juxtaposition%1:04:00:: by means---means%1:04:00:: of a series---series%1:14:00:: of arrows---arrow%1:10:00:: .
The data---data%1:14:00:: for boy---boy%1:18:00:: 34 appear in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 , and for girl---girl%1:18:02:: 2 in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 4 .
The numbering---numbering%1:10:00:: system---system%1:09:02:: used in Tables---table%1:14:00:: 1 and 2 and Figures---figure%1:10:00:: 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth---growth%1:22:00:: centers---center%1:15:01:: .
The `` dot---dot%1:25:00:: '' on one end---end%1:15:00:: of each arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: indicates extent---extent%1:26:00:: of difference in months---month%1:28:00:: between the child---child%1:18:00:: 's onset---onset%1:11:00:: age---age%1:07:00:: and the corresponding mean age---age%1:07:00:: for the growth---growth%1:22:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: .
The `` tip---tip%1:15:00:: '' of the arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: represents extent---extent%1:26:00:: of difference between the child---child%1:18:00:: 's completion age---age%1:07:00:: and the corresponding mean age---age%1:07:00:: for the growth---growth%1:22:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: .
Thus , the alignment---alignment%1:07:00:: of the `` dots---dot%1:25:00:: '' and `` tips---tip%1:15:00:: '' , respectively , indicate individual variability---variability%1:07:00:: of the 21 growth---growth%1:22:00:: centers---center%1:15:01:: of each child---child%1:18:00:: with respect to the mean values---value%1:09:00:: for these boys---boy%1:18:00:: and girls---girl%1:18:02:: .
The direction---direction%1:24:00:: in which the arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: points shows how the maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: level---level%1:07:00:: of the growth---growth%1:22:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: was changed at Completion from the level---level%1:07:00:: at Onset---onset%1:11:00:: .
When the `` dot---dot%1:25:00:: '' and `` tip---tip%1:15:00:: '' coincide , the classification---classification%1:14:00:: used in this paper---paper%1:10:01:: is `` same schedule---schedule%1:09:00:: '' .
The length---length%1:07:00:: of the arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: indicates amount---amount%1:07:00:: of slowing---slowing%1:07:00:: or acceleration---acceleration%1:04:00:: at Completion over that at Onset---onset%1:11:00:: , and the difference in months---month%1:28:00:: can be read roughly by referring the arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: to the age---age%1:07:00:: scale---scale%1:24:03:: along the base---base%1:17:00:: of each figure---figure%1:10:00:: , or more precisely by referring to the original data---data%1:14:00:: in the appropriate tables---table%1:14:00:: .
The difference---difference%1:11:00:: between the sequence---sequence%1:07:00:: of Onset---onset%1:11:00:: of ossification---ossification%1:22:00:: for the sexes---sex%1:14:00:: governs the numbering---numbering%1:10:00:: sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: in Figures---figure%1:10:00:: 3 and 4 .
This difference---difference%1:11:00:: is readily clarified by referring to Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 .
For example , arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: 17 in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 portrays the proximal radial epiphysis---epiphysis%1:08:00:: for boy---boy%1:18:00:: 34 , whereas the same epiphysis---epiphysis%1:08:00:: for girl---girl%1:18:02:: 2 is portrayed by arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: 18 in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 4 .
For the boy---boy%1:18:00:: , this epiphysis---epiphysis%1:08:00:: was markedly delayed at Onset---onset%1:11:00:: but near the mean---mean%1:09:00:: at Completion .
Thus , the Span---span%1:28:00:: of its ossification---ossification%1:22:00:: was shortened and the center---center%1:15:01:: 's ability---ability%1:07:00:: to `` catch up '' in ossification---ossification%1:22:00:: is demonstrated .
In contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: , for the girl---girl%1:18:02:: the epiphysis---epiphysis%1:08:00:: was slightly advanced at Onset---onset%1:11:00:: and delayed at Completion .
Obviously , the slowing---slowing%1:07:00:: for her may have occurred at any point---point%1:28:00:: between Onset---onset%1:11:00:: and Completion .
The Skeletal Age---age%1:07:00:: curve---curve%1:10:00:: in the lower portion---portion%1:24:00:: of Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 shows that slowing---slowing%1:07:00:: may have occurred for her during the prepubescent period---period%1:28:00:: .
Length---length%1:07:00:: of the shaft---shaft%1:10:00:: of these arrows---arrow%1:10:00:: may be evaluated according to the standard deviation---standard_deviation%1:09:00:: values---value%1:09:00:: for each center---center%1:15:01:: in Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 .
We have attempted to simplify the extensive task---task%1:04:01:: of analyzing onset---onset%1:11:00:: ages---age%1:07:00:: and completion ages---age%1:07:00:: of each child---child%1:18:00:: - more than 1700 values---value%1:09:00:: for the entire group---group%1:03:00:: - by constructing figures---figure%1:10:00:: for each of the 21 centers---center%1:15:01:: so that the data---data%1:14:00:: for all 34 boys---boy%1:18:00:: and 34 of the girls---girl%1:18:02:: will appear together for each growth---growth%1:22:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: .
Figures---figure%1:10:00:: 5 and 6 are examples---example%1:09:00:: of our method---method%1:09:00:: of analyzing the results---result%1:10:00:: for each growth---growth%1:22:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: .
Forty other figures---figure%1:10:00:: similar to 5 and 6 and the original data---data%1:14:00:: used in the construction---construction%1:04:00:: of all figures---figure%1:10:00:: and tables---table%1:14:00:: in this monograph---monograph%1:10:00:: have been included in the Appendix---appendix%1:10:00:: .
The principles---principle%1:09:01:: used in making each arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: for Figures---figure%1:10:00:: 3 and 4 were applied to the construction---construction%1:04:00:: of Figures---figure%1:10:00:: 5 and 6 as well as all figures---figure%1:10:00:: in the Appendix---appendix%1:10:00:: .
One growth---growth%1:22:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: in a short bone---short_bone%1:08:00:: - distal phalanx---phalanx%1:08:00:: of the second finger---finger%1:08:00:: - was chosen as an example---example%1:09:00:: for discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: here , primarily because epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion---fusion%1:11:00:: , the maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: indicator---indicator%1:10:00:: for Completion in long---long_bone%1:08:00:: and short bones---short_bone%1:08:00:: , occurs in this center---center%1:15:01:: for girls---girl%1:18:02:: near the menarche---menarche%1:11:00:: and for boys---boy%1:18:00:: near their comparable pubescent stage---stage%1:26:00:: .
Its Completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity---maturity%1:26:00:: indicators---indicator%1:10:00:: to include in studies---study%1:04:00:: of growth---growth%1:22:00:: , dietary patterns---pattern%1:04:00:: , and health---health%1:26:00:: during adolescence---adolescence%1:28:00:: .
The following summary---summary%1:10:00:: , based on Figures---figure%1:10:00:: 5 and 6 , is an example---example%1:09:00:: of one way---way%1:04:01:: of interpreting the 42 figures---figure%1:10:00:: constructed from onset---onset%1:11:00:: ages---age%1:07:00:: and completion ages---age%1:07:00:: of individual children---child%1:18:00:: with respect to the appropriate mean age---age%1:07:00:: for each growth---growth%1:22:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: .
At the top---top%1:15:01:: of Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 5 , for example , the Onset---onset%1:11:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: and Completion range---range%1:07:00:: lines---line%1:10:01:: for the chosen growth---growth%1:22:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: have been drawn for girls---girl%1:18:02:: according to their mean---mean%1:09:00:: and standard deviation---standard_deviation%1:09:00:: values---value%1:09:00:: in Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 .
The 34 arrows---arrow%1:10:00:: , denoting onset---onset%1:11:00:: age---age%1:07:00:: plus completion age---age%1:07:00:: deviations---deviation%1:09:00:: , have been arrayed in an Onset---onset%1:11:00:: sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: which begins with girl---girl%1:18:02:: 18 who had the earliest Onset---onset%1:11:00:: of the 34 girls---girl%1:18:02:: .
The growth---growth%1:22:00:: center---center%1:15:01:: depicted here , in the distal phalanx---phalanx%1:08:00:: of the second finger---finger%1:08:00:: , is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones---short_bone%1:08:00:: .
The mean onset---onset%1:11:00:: age---age%1:07:00:: was 25.3 months---month%1:28:00:: ( Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 ) , and the average Span---span%1:28:00:: of the osseous stage---stage%1:28:00:: was 133 months---month%1:28:00:: .
The correlation---correlation%1:09:00:: ( Table---table%1:14:00:: 2 ) between onset---onset%1:11:00:: age---age%1:07:00:: and completion age---age%1:07:00:: was + .50 , and that between onset---onset%1:11:00:: age---age%1:07:00:: and Span---span%1:28:00:: was - .10 .
With due consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: for the limits---limit%1:07:00:: of precision---precision%1:07:00:: in assessing , expected rate---rate%1:28:00:: of change---change%1:24:00:: in ossification---ossification%1:22:00:: of girls---girl%1:18:02:: age---age%1:07:00:: 2 years---year%1:28:01:: , and the known variations---variation%1:11:01:: in rate---rate%1:28:00:: of ossification---ossification%1:22:00:: of these children---child%1:18:00:: as described in our preceding paper---paper%1:10:01:: in the Supplement---supplement%1:10:00:: , each arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: with a `` shaft---shaft%1:10:00:: length---length%1:07:00:: '' of four months---month%1:28:00:: or less was selected as indicating `` same schedule---schedule%1:09:00:: '' at Onset---onset%1:11:00:: and Completion , for this particular epiphysis---epiphysis%1:08:00:: .
Accordingly , girls---girl%1:18:02:: 31 , 29 , 33 , 21 , 26 , 13 , 3 , 4 , 14 , 32 , 24 , 25 , 34 , 23 , 6 , 15 , 22 , and 16 may be said to have the `` same schedule---schedule%1:09:00:: '' at Onset---onset%1:11:00:: and Completion .
It seems clear , from the counter-balanced shape---shape%1:07:00:: of the series---series%1:14:00:: of arrows---arrow%1:10:00:: in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 5 that there was about an equal number---number%1:23:00:: of early and late Onsets---onset%1:11:00:: and Completions for the 34 girls---girl%1:18:02:: .
Accordingly , if epiphyseal diaphyseal fusion---fusion%1:11:00:: occurs in this phalanx---phalanx%1:08:00:: near menarche---menarche%1:11:00:: , early and late menarches---menarche%1:11:00:: might have been forecast rather precisely at the time---time%1:28:00:: of Onset---onset%1:11:00:: of ossification---ossification%1:22:00:: for the 18 girls---girl%1:18:02:: with `` same schedule---schedule%1:09:00:: '' .
As an example---example%1:09:00:: of the interpretation---interpretation%1:09:00:: of an arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: in the figure---figure%1:10:00:: which exceeds four months---month%1:28:00:: in shaft---shaft%1:10:00:: length---length%1:07:00:: in conjunction---conjunction%1:07:00:: with its position---position%1:07:00:: in the figure---figure%1:10:00:: : girl---girl%1:18:02:: 2 had a delayed Onset---onset%1:11:00:: and further delayed Completion .
It is of interest---interest%1:09:00:: that her menarche---menarche%1:11:00:: was somewhat later than the average for the girls---girl%1:18:02:: in this group---group%1:03:00:: .
A similar analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 6 for the 34 boys---boy%1:18:00:: would necessitate quite a different conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: about the predictive value---value%1:07:00:: of onset---onset%1:11:00:: age---age%1:07:00:: in forecasting their attainment---attainment%1:04:01:: of the pubescent stage---stage%1:26:00:: .
Boys---boy%1:18:00:: 32 , 23 , 31 , 17 , 30 , 19 , and 24 had `` same schedule---schedule%1:09:00:: '' at Onset---onset%1:11:00:: and Completion ; thus early forecasting---forecasting%1:10:00:: of the pubescent stage---stage%1:26:00:: would appear possible for only seven boys---boy%1:18:00:: .
Boy---boy%1:18:00:: 34 , like girl---girl%1:18:02:: 2 , did not have `` same schedule---schedule%1:09:00:: '' ; his arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: crosses the line---line%1:10:01:: denoting the mean---mean%1:09:00:: .
The `` dot---dot%1:25:00:: '' on his arrow---arrow%1:10:00:: indicates early Onset---onset%1:11:00:: and the `` tip---tip%1:15:00:: '' indicates relatively later Completion .
After the 42 figures---figure%1:10:00:: had been drawn like Figures---figure%1:10:00:: 5 and 6 , classifications---classification%1:14:00:: of the onset---onset%1:11:00:: ages---age%1:07:00:: and completion ages---age%1:07:00:: were summarized from them .
A proton magnetic resonance study---study%1:10:00:: of polycrystalline **f as a function of magnetic field and temperature is presented .
A proton magnetic resonance---proton_magnetic_resonance%1:19:00:: study---study%1:04:00:: of polycrystalline **f as a function---function%1:24:00:: of magnetic field---magnetic_field%1:19:00:: and temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: is presented .
**f is paramagnetic , and electron---electron%1:17:00:: paramagnetic dipole---dipole%1:17:00:: as well as nuclear dipole---dipole%1:17:00:: effects---effect%1:19:00:: lead to line---line%1:10:01:: broadening---broadening%1:04:01:: .
The lines---line%1:10:01:: are asymmetric and over the range of field---field%1:19:00:: **f gauss---gauss%1:23:00:: and temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: **f the asymmetry---asymmetry%1:07:00:: increases with increasing **f and decreasing T .
An isotropic resonance---resonance%1:19:01:: shift---shift%1:11:01:: of **f to lower applied fields---field%1:19:00:: indicates a weak isotropic hyperfine contact---contact%1:06:00:: interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: .
The general theory---theory%1:09:00:: of resonance---resonance%1:19:01:: shifts---shift%1:11:01:: is used to derive a general expression---expression%1:10:03:: for the second moment---second_moment%1:09:00:: **f of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample---sample%1:09:00:: and is specialized to **f .
The theory---theory%1:09:00:: predicts a linear dependence---dependence%1:26:00:: of **f on **f , where |j is the experimentally determined Curie-Weiss---person%1:03:00:: constant---constant%1:09:00:: .
The experimental second moment---second_moment%1:09:00:: **f conforms to the relation---relation%1:03:00:: **f in agreement with theory---theory%1:09:00:: .
Hence , the electron---electron%1:17:00:: paramagnetic effects---effect%1:19:00:: ( slope---slope%1:07:00:: ) can be separated from the nuclear effects---effect%1:19:00:: ( intercept---intercept%1:09:00:: ) .
The paramagnetic dipole---dipole%1:17:00:: effects---effect%1:19:00:: provide some information---information%1:09:00:: on the particle---particle%1:27:01:: shapes---shape%1:07:00:: .
The nuclear dipole---dipole%1:17:00:: effects---effect%1:19:00:: provide some information---information%1:09:00:: on the motions---motion%1:04:01:: of the hydrogen---hydrogen%1:27:00:: nuclei---nucleus%1:17:00:: , but the symmetry---symmetry%1:07:00:: of the **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: in **f remains in doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: .
The magnetic moment---magnetic_moment%1:19:00:: of an unpaired electron---electron%1:17:00:: associated nearby may have a tremendous influence---influence%1:07:00:: on the magnetic resonance---magnetic_resonance%1:19:00:: properties---property%1:07:00:: of nuclei---nucleus%1:17:00:: .
It is important to consider and experimentally verify this influence---influence%1:07:00:: since quantitative nuclear resonance---nuclear_resonance%1:19:00:: is becoming increasingly used in investigations---investigation%1:09:00:: of structure---structure%1:07:00:: .
**f appeared to be well suited for the study---study%1:04:00:: of these matters---matter%1:09:01:: , since it is a normal paramagnet---paramagnet%1:06:00:: , with three unpaired electrons---electron%1:17:00:: on the chromium---chromium%1:27:00:: , its crystal---crystal%1:27:00:: structure---structure%1:07:00:: is very simple , and the unknown position---position%1:15:00:: of the hydrogen---hydrogen%1:27:00:: in the strong **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: provides structural interest---interest%1:09:00:: .
We first discuss the **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: in **f .
We then outline the theory---theory%1:09:00:: of the interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: of paramagnetic dipoles---dipole%1:17:00:: with nuclei---nucleus%1:17:00:: and show that the theory---theory%1:09:00:: is in excellent agreement---agreement%1:07:00:: with experiment---experiment%1:09:00:: .
Indeed it is possible to separate electron---electron%1:17:00:: paramagnetic from nuclear effects---effect%1:19:00:: .
The information---information%1:09:00:: provided by the electron---electron%1:17:00:: paramagnetic effects---effect%1:19:00:: is then discussed , and finally the nuclear effects---effect%1:19:00:: are interpreted in terms of various motional modified models---model%1:09:00:: of the **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: in **f .
Theoretical studies---study%1:04:00:: of the hydrogen bond---hydrogen_bond%1:19:00:: generally agree that the **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: will be linear in the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of peculiarities---peculiarity%1:07:02:: of packing---packing%1:27:00:: in the solid---solid%1:27:04:: .
Moreover , it will be asymmetric until a certain critical **f distance---distance%1:07:00:: is reached , below which it will become symmetric .
There is ample evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: from many sources---source%1:10:00:: that the **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: in **f is symmetric .
The **f distance---distance%1:07:00:: in **f is 2.26 A---a%1:23:01:: .
There is evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: , though less convincing than for **f , that the **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: in nickel---nickel%1:27:00:: dimethylglyoxime---dimethylglyoxime%1:27:00:: is symmetric .
Here the **f distance---distance%1:07:00:: is 2.44 A---a%1:23:01:: .
A number---number%1:07:00:: of semiempirical estimates---estimate%1:09:00:: by various workers---worker%1:18:00:: lead to the conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: that the **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: becomes symmetric when the **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: length---length%1:07:00:: is about 2.4 to 2.5 A---a%1:23:01:: , but aside from the possible example---example%1:09:02:: of nickel---nickel%1:27:00:: dimethylglyoxime---dimethylglyoxime%1:27:00:: there have been no convincing reports---report%1:10:03:: of symmetric **f bonds---bond%1:19:00:: .
Douglass---person%1:03:00:: has studied the crystal---crystal%1:27:00:: structure---structure%1:07:00:: of **f by x-ray diffraction---x-ray_diffraction%1:19:00:: .
He finds the structure---structure%1:07:00:: contains an **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: with the **f distance---distance%1:07:00:: of **f .
There is , then , the possibility---possibility%1:09:00:: that this **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: is symmetric , although Douglass---person%1:03:00:: was unable to determine its symmetry---symmetry%1:07:00:: from his x-ray---x_ray%1:19:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: .
Douglass---person%1:03:00:: found **f to be trigonal , Laue---person%1:03:00:: symmetry---symmetry%1:07:00:: **f , with **f , **f .
X-ray---x_ray%1:19:00:: and experimental density---density%1:07:00:: showed one formula---formula%1:10:03:: unit---unit%1:24:00:: in the unit cell---unit_cell%1:17:00:: , corresponding to a paramagnetic ion---ion%1:17:00:: density---density%1:07:00:: of **f .
The x-ray---x_ray%1:19:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: did not permit Douglass---person%1:03:00:: to determine uniquely the space---space%1:03:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: , but a negative test---test%1:09:02:: for piezoelectricity---piezoelectricity%1:19:00:: led him to assume a center---center%1:15:00:: of symmetry---symmetry%1:07:00:: .
Under this assumption---assumption%1:09:00:: the space---space%1:03:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: must be **f and the following are the positions---position%1:15:00:: of the atoms---atom%1:27:00:: in the unit cell---unit_cell%1:17:00:: .
This space---space%1:03:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: requires the hydrogen bond---hydrogen_bond%1:19:00:: to be symmetric .
Douglass---person%1:03:00:: found powder---powder%1:27:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: calculations---calculation%1:09:00:: and measurements to agree best for **f .
These data---data%1:14:00:: lead to a structure---structure%1:07:00:: in which sheets---sheet%1:17:00:: of Cr---cr%1:27:00:: atoms---atom%1:27:00:: lie between two sheets---sheet%1:17:00:: of O---o%1:27:00:: atoms---atom%1:27:00:: .
The O---o%1:27:00:: atoms---atom%1:27:00:: in each sheet---sheet%1:17:00:: are close packed and each Cr---cr%1:27:00:: atom---atom%1:27:00:: is surrounded by a distorted octahedron---octahedron%1:25:00:: of O---o%1:27:00:: atoms---atom%1:27:00:: .
The **f layers---layer%1:06:00:: are stacked normal to the [ 111 ] axis---axis%1:09:00:: with the lower oxygens---oxygen%1:27:00:: of one layer---layer%1:06:00:: directly above the upper oxygens---oxygen%1:27:00:: of the neighboring lower layer---layer%1:06:00:: , in such a manner---manner%1:07:02:: that the repeat---repeat%1:11:00:: is every three layers---layer%1:06:00:: .
The separate layers---layer%1:06:00:: are joined together by hydrogen bonds---hydrogen_bond%1:19:00:: .
A drawing---drawing%1:10:00:: of the structure---structure%1:07:00:: is to be found in reference---reference%1:10:03:: 6 .
The gross details---detail%1:09:00:: of the structure---structure%1:07:00:: appear reasonable .
The structure---structure%1:07:00:: appears to be unique among ROOH compounds---compound%1:27:00:: , but is the same as that assumed by **f .
The bond---bond%1:19:00:: angles---angle%1:25:00:: and distances---distance%1:07:00:: are all within the expected limits---limit%1:15:02:: and the volume---volume%1:23:00:: per oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: is about normal .
However , the possible absence---absence%1:26:00:: of a center---center%1:15:00:: of symmetry---symmetry%1:07:00:: not only moves the hydrogen atom---hydrogen_atom%1:27:00:: off **f , but also allows the oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: atoms---atom%1:27:00:: to become nonequivalent , with **f at **f and **f at **f ( space---space%1:03:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: **f ) , where **f represents the oxygens---oxygen%1:27:00:: on one side---side%1:15:02:: of the **f layers---layer%1:06:00:: and **f those on the other side---side%1:15:02:: .
However , any oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: nonequivalence---nonequivalence%1:07:00:: would shorten either the already extremely short **f interlayer---interlayer%1:06:00:: distance---distance%1:07:00:: of 2.55 A---a%1:23:01:: or the non hydrogen bonded---hydrogen_bond%1:19:00:: **f interlayer---interlayer%1:06:00:: interactions---interaction%1:04:00:: which are already quite short at 2.58 A---a%1:23:01:: .
Hence it is difficult to conceive of a packing---packing%1:27:00:: of the atoms---atom%1:27:00:: in this material---material%1:27:00:: in which the oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: atoms---atom%1:27:00:: are far from geometrical equivalence---equivalence%1:26:00:: .
The only effect---effect%1:19:00:: of lack---lack%1:26:00:: of a center---center%1:15:00:: would then be to release the hydrogen atoms---hydrogen_atom%1:27:00:: to occupy general , rather than special , positions---position%1:15:00:: along the [ 111 ] axis---axis%1:09:00:: .
If the **f bond---bond%1:19:00:: is linear then there are three reasonable positions---position%1:15:00:: for the hydrogen atoms---hydrogen_atom%1:27:00:: : ( 1 ) The hydrogen atoms---hydrogen_atom%1:27:00:: are centered and hence all lie on a sheet---sheet%1:17:00:: midway between the oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: sheets---sheet%1:17:00:: ; ( 2 ) all hydrogen atoms---hydrogen_atom%1:27:00:: lie on a sheet---sheet%1:17:00:: , but the sheet---sheet%1:17:00:: is closer to one oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: sheet---sheet%1:17:00:: than to the other ; ( 3 ) hydrogen atoms---hydrogen_atom%1:27:00:: are asymmetrically placed , either randomly or in an ordered way---way%1:07:01:: , so that some hydrogen atoms---hydrogen_atom%1:27:00:: are closer to the upper oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: atoms---atom%1:27:00:: while others are closer to the lower oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: atoms---atom%1:27:00:: .
Position---position%1:15:00:: ( 2 ) appears to us to be unlikely in view of the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of a piezoelectric effect---piezoelectric_effect%1:19:00:: and on general chemical structural grounds---grounds%1:09:00:: .
A randomization---randomization%1:04:00:: of `` ups '' and `` downs '' is more likely than ordered `` ups '' and `` downs '' in position---position%1:15:00:: ( 3 ) since the hydrogen atoms---hydrogen_atom%1:27:00:: are well separated and so the position---position%1:15:00:: of one could hardly affect the position---position%1:15:00:: of another , and also since ordered `` up '' and `` down '' implies a larger unit cell---unit_cell%1:17:00:: , for which no evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: exists .
Therefore , the only unknown structural feature---feature%1:09:00:: would appear to be whether the hydrogen atoms---hydrogen_atom%1:27:00:: are located symmetrically ( 1 ) or asymmetrically ( 3 ) .
Douglass---person%1:03:00:: prepared his sample---sample%1:09:00:: of **f by thermal decomposition---decomposition%1:26:00:: of aqueous chromic acid---chromic_acid%1:27:00:: at 300 - 325 ` C---c%1:23:02:: .
Dr. Douglass---person%1:03:00:: was kind enough to lend us about 5 grams---gram%1:23:00:: of his material---material%1:27:00:: .
This material---material%1:27:00:: proved to be unsatisfactory , since we could not obtain reproducible results---result%1:10:00:: on various portions---portion%1:24:00:: of the sample---sample%1:09:00:: .
Subsequently , we learned from Douglass---person%1:03:00:: that his sample---sample%1:09:00:: contained a few percent---percent%1:24:00:: **f impurity---impurity%1:27:00:: .
Since **f is ferromagnetic , we felt that any results---result%1:10:00:: obtained from the magnetically contaminated **f would be suspect .
Plane---person%1:03:00:: suggested another preparation---preparation%1:27:00:: of **f which we used here .
500 ml---ml%1:23:00:: of 1 M---m%1:07:00:: aqueous **f with 1 g---g%1:23:00:: **f added are heated in a bomb---bomb%1:06:01:: at 170 ` C---c%1:23:02:: for 48 hours---hour%1:28:00:: .
A very fine , gray solid---solid%1:27:04:: ( about 15 g---g%1:23:00:: ) is formed , water-washed by centrifugation---centrifugation%1:22:00:: , and dried at 110 ` C---c%1:23:02:: .
Differential thermal analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: showed a very small endothermic reaction---endothermic_reaction%1:22:00:: at 340 ` C---c%1:23:02:: and a large endothermic reaction---endothermic_reaction%1:22:00:: at 470 ` C---c%1:23:02:: .
This latter reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: is in accord with the reported decomposition---decomposition%1:26:00:: of **f .
Thermogravimetric analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: showed a weight---weight%1:07:00:: loss---loss%1:22:00:: of 1.8 % centered at 337 ` C---c%1:23:02:: and another weight---weight%1:07:00:: loss---loss%1:22:00:: of 10.8 % at 463 ` C---c%1:23:02:: .
The expected weight---weight%1:07:00:: loss---loss%1:22:00:: for **f going to **f and **f is 10.6 % .
Mass spectrometric analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of gases---gas%1:26:00:: evolved upon heating to 410 ` C---c%1:23:02:: indicated nitrogen oxides---nitrogen_oxide%1:27:00:: and water vapor---water_vapor%1:27:00:: .
The small reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: occurring at 337 ` C---c%1:23:02:: is probably caused by decomposition---decomposition%1:26:00:: of occluded nitrates---nitrate%1:27:00:: , and perhaps by a small amount---amount%1:03:00:: of some hydrous material---material%1:27:00:: other than **f .
All subsequent measurements were made on material---material%1:27:00:: which had been heated to 375 ` C---c%1:23:02:: for one hour---hour%1:28:00:: .
Emission spectra---emission_spectrum%1:19:00:: indicated **f calcium---calcium%1:27:00:: and all other impurities---impurity%1:27:00:: much lower .
Chromium---chromium%1:27:00:: analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: gave 58.8 % Cr---cr%1:27:00:: as compared with 61.2 % theory---theory%1:09:00:: .
However , **f adsorbs water---water%1:27:00:: from the atmosphere---atmosphere%1:15:00:: and this may account for the low chromium---chromium%1:27:00:: analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: and high total weight---weight%1:07:00:: loss---loss%1:22:00:: .
The x-ray diffraction---x-ray_diffraction%1:19:00:: pattern---pattern%1:09:03:: of the material---material%1:27:00:: , taken with CuKla radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: , indicated the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of no extra lines---line%1:10:01:: and was in good agreement---agreement%1:07:00:: with the pattern---pattern%1:09:03:: of Douglass---person%1:03:00:: .
Magnetic analyses---analysis%1:04:00:: by R. G. Meisenheimer---person%1:03:00:: of this laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: indicated no ferromagnetic impurities---impurity%1:27:00:: .
**f was found to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electron---electron%1:17:00:: per chromium---chromium%1:27:00:: atom---atom%1:27:00:: and a molecular susceptibility---susceptibility%1:26:00:: of **f , where **f .
For exactly three unpaired electrons---electron%1:17:00:: the coefficient---coefficient%1:23:00:: would be 3.10 .
An infrared spectrum---infrared_spectrum%1:19:00:: , obtained by H. A. Benesi---person%1:03:00:: and R. G. Snyder---person%1:03:00:: of this laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: , showed bands---band%1:07:00:: in the positions---position%1:15:00:: found by Jones---person%1:03:00:: .
Electron microscopic examination---examination%1:04:00:: of the **f sample---sample%1:09:00:: showed it to be composed of nearly isotropic particles---particle%1:27:01:: about 0.3 lm in diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: .
The particles---particle%1:27:01:: appeared rough and undoubtedly the single crystal---crystal%1:17:00:: domains---domain%1:15:00:: are smaller than this .
The x-ray---x_ray%1:19:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: are consistent with particle---particle%1:27:01:: sizes---size%1:07:00:: of 1000 A---a%1:23:01:: or greater .
We found no obvious effects---effect%1:19:00:: due to preferred orientation---orientation%1:04:00:: of the crystallites---crystallite%1:17:00:: in this sample---sample%1:09:00:: nor would we expect to on the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of the shape---shape%1:07:00:: found from electron microscopic examination---examination%1:04:00:: .
The magnetic resonance---magnetic_resonance%1:19:00:: absorption---absorption%1:22:02:: was detected by employing a Varian model---model%1:09:03:: **f broad line---line%1:10:01:: spectrometer---spectrometer%1:06:00:: and the associated 12 - inch---inch%1:23:00:: electromagnet---electromagnet%1:06:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: .
One measurement at 40 Mc---mc%1:28:00:: / sec---sec%1:28:00:: was obtained with the Varian model---model%1:09:03:: **f unit .
A bridged-T---bridged-t%1:06:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: of bridge---bridge%1:06:05:: was used in the 10 - 16 Mc---mc%1:28:00:: / sec---sec%1:28:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: .
The rf power---power%1:19:00:: level---level%1:07:00:: was maintained small enough at all times---time%1:11:00:: to prevent obvious line---line%1:10:01:: shape---shape%1:07:00:: distortions---distortion%1:25:00:: by saturation---saturation%1:22:00:: effects---effect%1:19:00:: .
A modulation---modulation%1:10:00:: frequency---frequency%1:28:00:: of 40 cps---cps%1:28:00:: with an amplitude---amplitude%1:11:00:: as small as possible , commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise---signal-to-noise%1:24:00:: quality---quality%1:07:02:: , was used .
Background---background%1:11:00:: spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: were obtained in all cases---case%1:11:00:: .
The spectrometer---spectrometer%1:06:00:: was adjusted to minimize the amount---amount%1:03:00:: of dispersion---dispersion%1:11:00:: mode---mode%1:07:00:: mixed in with the absorption---absorption%1:22:02:: signal---signal%1:10:00:: .
A single value---value%1:09:00:: of the thermal relaxation time---relaxation_time%1:28:00:: **f at room temperature---room_temperature%1:07:00:: was measured by the progressive saturation---saturation%1:22:00:: method---method%1:09:00:: .
The value---value%1:09:00:: of **f estimated at 470 gauss---gauss%1:23:00:: was **f microseconds---microsecond%1:28:00:: .
A single measurement of the spin spin relaxation time---relaxation_time%1:28:00:: **f was obtained at 10 Mc---mc%1:28:00:: / sec---sec%1:28:00:: by pulse---pulse%1:11:00:: methods---method%1:09:00:: .
This measurement was obtained by W. Blumberg---person%1:03:00:: of the University of California,Berkeley---group%1:03:00:: , by observing the breadth---breadth%1:07:00:: of the free induction---induction%1:19:00:: decay---decay%1:22:01:: signal---signal%1:10:00:: .
The value---value%1:09:00:: derived was 16 microseconds---microsecond%1:28:00:: .
Field---field%1:19:00:: shifts---shift%1:11:01:: were derived from the mean value---value%1:09:00:: of the resonance---resonance%1:19:01:: line---line%1:10:01:: , defined as the field---field%1:19:00:: about which the first moment---first_moment%1:09:00:: is zero .
Second moments---second_moment%1:09:00:: of the spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: were computed by numerical integration---integration%1:04:03:: .
Corrections---correction%1:04:00:: were applied for modulation---modulation%1:10:00:: broadening , apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: background---background%1:11:00:: , and field---field%1:19:00:: shift---shift%1:11:01:: .
Spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: were obtained over the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: of 77 - 294 ` K---k%1:23:05:: .
For the low-temperature---low_temperature%1:07:00:: measurements the sample---sample%1:09:00:: was cooled by a cold nitrogen---nitrogen%1:27:00:: gas---gas%1:26:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: method---method%1:09:00:: similar to that of Andrew---person%1:03:00:: and Eades---person%1:03:00:: .
The temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: was maintained to within about **f for the period of time---period_of_time%1:28:00:: required to make the measurement ( usually about one hour---hour%1:28:00:: ) .
One sample---sample%1:09:00:: , which had been exposed to the atmosphere---atmosphere%1:15:00:: after evacuation---evacuation%1:04:00:: at 375 ` C---c%1:23:02:: , showed the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of adsorbed water---water%1:27:00:: ( about 0.3 wt % ) as evidenced by a weak resonance---resonance%1:19:01:: line---line%1:10:01:: which was very narrow at room temperature---room_temperature%1:07:00:: and which disappeared , due to broadening---broadening%1:04:01:: , at low temperature---low_temperature%1:07:00:: .
The data---data%1:14:00:: reported here are either from spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: from which the adsorbed water---water%1:27:00:: resonance---resonance%1:19:01:: could easily be eliminated or from spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: of samples---sample%1:09:00:: evacuated and sealed off at 375 ` C---c%1:23:02:: which contain no adsorbed water---water%1:27:00:: .
The measured powder---powder%1:27:00:: density---density%1:07:00:: of the **f used here was about **f , approximately one-third---one-third%1:23:00:: that of the crystal---crystal%1:27:00:: density---density%1:07:00:: ( **f ) .
Such a density---density%1:07:00:: corresponds to a paramagnetic ion---ion%1:17:00:: density---density%1:07:00:: of about **f .
Spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: were obtained from a powdered sample---sample%1:09:00:: having the shape---shape%1:07:00:: of a right circular cylinder---cylinder%1:25:02:: with a height---height%1:07:00:: to diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: of 4 : 1 .
The top---top%1:15:00:: of the sample---sample%1:09:00:: was nearly flat and the bottom---bottom%1:15:00:: hemispherical .
Spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: were also obtained from a sample---sample%1:09:00:: in a spherical container---container%1:06:00:: which was made by blowing a bubble---bubble%1:17:00:: on the end---end%1:15:00:: of a capillary---capillary%1:06:00:: glass---glass%1:27:00:: tube---tube%1:06:00:: .
The bubble---bubble%1:17:00:: was filled to the top---top%1:15:00:: and special precautions---precaution%1:04:00:: were taken to prevent any sample---sample%1:09:00:: from remaining in the capillary---capillary%1:06:00:: .
Spectra---spectrum%1:19:00:: were also obtained from a third sample---sample%1:09:00:: of **f which had been diluted to three times its original volume---volume%1:23:00:: with powdered , anhydrous alundum---alundum%1:27:00:: ( **f ) .
This sample---sample%1:09:00:: was contained in a cylindrical container---container%1:06:00:: similar to that described above .
Since emotional reactions---reaction%1:04:00:: in the higher vertebrates---vertebrate%1:05:00:: depend on individual experience---experience%1:09:00:: and are aroused in man---man%1:05:01:: , in addition , by complex symbols---symbol%1:10:00:: , one would expect that the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: could be excited from the cortex---cortex%1:08:01:: .
In experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: with topical application---application%1:04:03:: of strychnine---strychnine%1:27:00:: on the cerebral cortex---cerebral_cortex%1:08:00:: , the transmission---transmission%1:04:01:: of impulses---impulse%1:11:00:: from the cortex---cortex%1:08:01:: to the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: was demonstrated .
Moreover , the responsiveness---responsiveness%1:09:00:: of the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: to nociceptive stimulation---stimulation%1:04:00:: is greatly increased under these conditions---condition%1:26:00:: .
Even more complex and obviously cortically induced forms---form%1:09:01:: of emotional arousal---emotional_arousal%1:26:00:: could be elicited in monkey---monkey%1:05:00:: A on seeing monkey---monkey%1:05:00:: B ( but not a rabbit---rabbit%1:05:00:: ) in emotional stress---stress%1:26:01:: .
A previously extinguished conditioned reaction---conditioned_reaction%1:04:00:: was restored in monkey---monkey%1:05:00:: A and was associated with typical signs---sign%1:10:05:: of emotional excitement---excitement%1:04:00:: including sympathetic discharges---discharge%1:11:00:: .
It seems to follow that by and large an antagonism exists between the paleo---paleocortex%1:08:00:: - and the neocortex---neocortex%1:08:00:: as far as emotional reactivity---reactivity%1:09:00:: is concerned , and that the balance---balance%1:26:00:: between the two systems---system%1:08:00:: determines the emotional responsiveness---responsiveness%1:09:00:: of the organism---organism%1:03:00:: .
In addition , the neocortical hypothalamic relations---relation%1:03:00:: play a great role---role%1:04:00:: in primates---primates%1:05:00:: , as Mirsky---person%1:03:00:: 's interesting experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: on the `` communication---communication%1:10:01:: of affect---affect%1:12:00:: '' demonstrates .
But even in relatively primitive laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: animals---animal%1:03:00:: such as the rat---rat%1:05:00:: , sex activity---sex_activity%1:04:00:: closely identified with the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: and the visceral brain---visceral_brain%1:08:00:: is enhanced by the neocortex---neocortex%1:08:00:: .
MacLean---person%1:03:00:: stressed correctly the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of the visceral brain---visceral_brain%1:08:00:: for preservation---preservation%1:04:00:: of the individual---individual%1:18:00:: and the species---species%1:14:00:: , as evidenced by the influence---influence%1:04:00:: of the limbic brain---limbic_brain%1:08:00:: ( including the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: ) on emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: related to fight---fight%1:07:00:: and flight---flight%1:04:01:: and also on sexual functions---function%1:07:00:: .
It should be added that in man---man%1:05:01:: neocortical hypothalamic interrelations---interrelation%1:24:00:: probably play a role---role%1:04:00:: in the fusion---fusion%1:11:00:: of emotional processes with those underlying perception---perception%1:09:00:: , memory---memory%1:09:01:: , imagination---imagination%1:09:02:: , and creativity---creativity%1:09:00:: .
Previous experiences---experience%1:09:00:: are obviously of great importance---importance%1:07:00:: for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response---response%1:04:01:: .
The visceral brain---visceral_brain%1:08:00:: as well as the neocortex---neocortex%1:08:00:: is known to contribute to memory---memory%1:09:01:: , but this topic---topic%1:09:00:: is beyond the scope---scope%1:07:00:: of this paper---paper%1:10:01:: .
After this brief discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: of neo - , paleocortical , and cortico-hypothalamic relations---relation%1:03:00:: , let us return once more to the problem---problem%1:10:00:: of hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: and its physiological and pathological significance---significance%1:07:00:: .
Facilitatory processes take place between neocortex---neocortex%1:08:00:: and hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: via ascending and descending pathways---pathway%1:08:00:: .
Thus cortico-fugal discharges---discharge%1:11:00:: induced by topical application---application%1:04:03:: of strychnine---strychnine%1:27:00:: to a minute area---area%1:08:00:: in the neocortex---neocortex%1:08:00:: summate with spikes---spike%1:11:00:: present in the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: and cause increased convulsive discharges---discharge%1:11:00:: .
On the other hand , the temporary reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: in hypothalamic excitability---excitability%1:09:00:: through the injection---injection%1:04:00:: of a barbiturate---barbiturate%1:06:00:: into the posterior hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: causes a lessening---lessening%1:11:00:: in frequency---frequency%1:23:00:: and amplitude---amplitude%1:11:00:: of cortical strychnine---strychnine%1:27:00:: spikes---spike%1:11:00:: until the hypothalamic excitability---excitability%1:09:00:: is restored .
Apparently , a positive feedback---positive_feedback%1:22:00:: exists between the posterior hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: and the cerebral cortex---cerebral_cortex%1:08:00:: .
Consequently , if for any reason---reason%1:10:01:: the hypothalamic excitability---excitability%1:09:00:: falls below the physiological level---level%1:07:00:: , the lessened hypothalamic cortical discharges---discharge%1:11:00:: lead to a diminished state---state%1:03:00:: of activity---activity%1:26:00:: in the cortex---cortex%1:08:01:: with consequent reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: in the cortico-fugal discharges---discharge%1:11:00:: .
Obviously , a vicious cycle---vicious_cycle%1:22:00:: develops .
This tendency---tendency%1:07:00:: can be broken either by restoring hypothalamic excitability---excitability%1:09:00:: directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathways---pathway%1:08:00:: .
It is believed that drug---drug%1:06:00:: therapy---therapy%1:04:00:: and electroshock---electroshock%1:04:00:: involve the former and psychotherapy---psychotherapy%1:09:00:: the latter mechanism---mechanism%1:04:00:: .
Before we comment further on these pathological conditions---condition%1:26:00:: , we should remember that changes---change%1:24:00:: in the state---state%1:03:00:: of the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: within physiological limits---limit%1:15:00:: distinguish sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: from wakefulness---wakefulness%1:09:00:: .
Thus , a low intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: of hypothalamic cortical discharges---discharge%1:11:00:: prevails in sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: and a high one during wakefulness---wakefulness%1:09:00:: , resulting in synchronous EEG---eeg%1:10:00:: potentials---potential%1:26:00:: in the former and asynchrony---asynchrony%1:24:00:: in the latter condition---condition%1:26:00:: .
Moreover , the dominance---dominance%1:07:02:: in parasympathetic action---action%1:26:00:: ( with reciprocal inhibition---inhibition%1:07:00:: of the sympathetic ) at the hypothalamic level---level%1:07:00:: induces , by its peripheral action---action%1:26:00:: , the autonomic symptoms---symptom%1:10:00:: of sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: and , by its action---action%1:26:00:: on the cortex---cortex%1:08:01:: , a lessening---lessening%1:11:00:: in the reactivity---reactivity%1:09:00:: of the sensory and motor apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: of the somatic nervous system---nervous_system%1:08:00:: .
With the dominance---dominance%1:07:02:: of the sympathetic division---division%1:09:00:: of the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: , the opposite changes---change%1:11:00:: occur .
Since electrical stimulation---stimulation%1:04:00:: of the posterior hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: produces the effects---effect%1:19:00:: of wakefulness---wakefulness%1:09:00:: while stimulation---stimulation%1:04:00:: of the anterior hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: induces sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: , it may be said that the reactivity---reactivity%1:09:00:: of the whole organism---organism%1:03:00:: is altered by a change---change%1:11:00:: in the autonomic reactivity---reactivity%1:09:00:: of the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: .
Similar effects---effect%1:19:00:: can be induced reflexly via the baroreceptor---baroreceptor%1:08:00:: reflexes---reflex%1:04:00:: in man---man%1:05:01:: and animals---animal%1:03:00:: .
Of particular importance---importance%1:07:00:: is the study---study%1:04:00:: of the actions---action%1:26:00:: of drugs---drug%1:06:00:: in this respect---respect%1:09:00:: .
Although no drugs---drug%1:06:00:: act exclusively on the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: or a part---part%1:17:00:: of it , there is sufficient specificity---specificity%1:07:01:: to distinguish drugs---drug%1:06:00:: which shift the hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: to the sympathetic side---side%1:15:02:: from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance---dominance%1:07:02:: .
The former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drugs---psychoactive_drug%1:06:00:: , the latter the tranquilizers---tranquilizer%1:06:00:: .
Specific differences---difference%1:07:00:: exist in the action---action%1:26:00:: of different drugs---drug%1:06:00:: belonging to the same group---group%1:03:00:: as , for instance , between reserpine---reserpine%1:06:00:: and chlorpromazine---chlorpromazine%1:06:00:: .
Important as these differences---difference%1:07:00:: are , they should not obscure the basic fact---fact%1:09:01:: that by shifting the hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: sufficiently to the parasympathetic side---side%1:15:02:: , we produce depressions---depression%1:26:00:: , whereas a shift---shift%1:11:00:: in the opposite direction---direction%1:09:00:: causes excitatory effects---effect%1:19:00:: and , eventually , maniclike changes---change%1:19:00:: .
The emotional states---emotional_state%1:26:00:: produced by drugs---drug%1:06:00:: influence---influence%1:04:00:: the cortical potentials---cortical_potential%1:19:00:: in a characteristic manner---manner%1:07:02:: ; synchrony---synchrony%1:24:00:: prevails in the EEG---eeg%1:10:00:: of the experimental animal---animal%1:03:00:: after administration---administration%1:04:01:: of tranquilizers---tranquilizer%1:06:00:: , but asynchrony---asynchrony%1:24:00:: after application---application%1:04:02:: of analeptic and psychoactive drugs---psychoactive_drug%1:06:00:: .
The shock therapies---shock_therapy%1:04:00:: act likewise on the hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: .
Physiological experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: and clinical observations---observation%1:04:01:: have shown that these procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: influence the hypothalamically controlled hypophyseal secretions---secretion%1:08:00:: and increase sympathetic discharges---discharge%1:11:00:: .
They shift the hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: to the sympathetic side---side%1:15:02:: .
This explains the beneficial effect---effect%1:19:00:: of electroshock therapy---electroshock_therapy%1:04:00:: in certain depressions---depression%1:26:00:: and a shift---shift%1:11:00:: in the reaction---reaction%1:04:00:: from hypo - to normal reactivity---reactivity%1:09:00:: of the sympathetic system---system%1:08:00:: as shown by the Mecholyl test .
Some investigators---investigator%1:18:01:: have found a parallelism---parallelism%1:07:00:: between remissions---remission%1:11:00:: and return of the sympathetic reactivity---reactivity%1:09:00:: of the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: to the normal level---level%1:07:00:: as indicated by the Mecholyl test and , conversely , between clinical impairment---impairment%1:11:00:: and increasing deviation---deviation%1:11:00:: of this test---test%1:09:02:: from the norm---norm%1:24:00:: .
Nevertheless , the theory---theory%1:09:01:: that the determining influence---influence%1:04:00:: of the hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: has a profound influence---influence%1:04:00:: on the clinical behavior---behavior%1:07:00:: of neuropsychiatric patients---patient%1:18:00:: has not yet been tested on an adequate number---number%1:07:00:: of patients---patient%1:18:00:: .
The Mecholyl and noradrenalin---noradrenaline%1:08:00:: tests---test%1:09:02:: applied with certain precautions---precaution%1:07:00:: are reliable indicators---indicator%1:10:01:: of this central autonomic balance---balance%1:26:00:: , but for the sake---sake%1:07:00:: of correlating autonomic and clinical states---state%1:03:00:: , and of studying the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of certain therapeutic procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: on central autonomic reactions---reaction%1:04:00:: , additional tests---test%1:09:02:: seem to be desirable .
It was assumed that the shift---shift%1:11:00:: in autonomic hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: occurring spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patients---patient%1:18:00:: from the application---application%1:04:02:: of certain therapeutic procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: follows the pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: known from the sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: wakefulness---wakefulness%1:09:00:: cycle---cycle%1:28:00:: .
A change---change%1:11:00:: in the balance---balance%1:26:00:: to the parasympathetic side---side%1:15:02:: leads in the normal individual---individual%1:18:00:: to sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: or , in special circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: , to cardiovascular collapse---collapse%1:26:01:: or nausea---nausea%1:26:00:: and vomiting---vomiting%1:04:00:: .
In both conditions---condition%1:26:00:: the emotional and perceptual sensitivity---sensitivity%1:12:00:: is diminished , but no depression---depression%1:26:00:: occurs such as is seen clinically or may be produced in normal persons---person%1:03:00:: by drugs---drug%1:06:00:: .
The fundamental differences---difference%1:07:00:: between physiological and pathological states---state%1:03:00:: of parasympathetic ( and also of sympathetic ) dominance---dominance%1:07:02:: remain to be elucidated .
Perhaps a clue---clue%1:10:00:: to these and related problems---problem%1:10:00:: lies in the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that changes---change%1:24:00:: in the intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: of hypothalamic discharges---discharge%1:11:00:: which are associated with changes---change%1:24:00:: in its balance---balance%1:26:00:: lead also to qualitative alterations---alteration%1:11:00:: in reactivity---reactivity%1:09:00:: .
A state---state%1:03:00:: of parasympathetic `` tuning---tuning%1:04:00:: '' of the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: induced experimentally causes not only an increase---increase%1:11:00:: in the parasympathetic reactivity---reactivity%1:09:00:: this structure---structure%1:08:00:: to direct and reflexly induced stimuli---stimulus%1:09:00:: , but leads also to an autonomic reversal---reversal%1:04:00:: : a stimulus---stimulus%1:09:00:: acting sympathetically under control conditions---control_condition%1:09:00:: elicits in this state---state%1:03:00:: of tuning---tuning%1:04:00:: a parasympathetic response---response%1:04:01:: !
Furthermore , conditioned reactions---conditioned_reaction%1:04:00:: are fundamentally altered when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity---reactivity%1:09:00:: is augmented beyond a critical level---level%1:07:00:: , and several types---type%1:09:00:: of behavioral changes---change%1:11:00:: probably related to the degree---degree%1:26:01:: of central autonomic `` tuning---tuning%1:04:00:: '' are observed .
If , for instance , such a change---change%1:11:00:: is produced by one or a few insulin---insulin%1:08:00:: comas---coma%1:09:00:: or electroshocks---electroshock%1:04:00:: , previously inhibited conditioned reactions---conditioned_reaction%1:04:00:: reappear .
However , if these procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: are applied more often , conditioned---conditioned_response%1:04:00:: emotional responses---response%1:04:01:: are temporarily abolished .
In other studies---study%1:04:00:: , loss---loss%1:22:00:: of differentiation---differentiation%1:09:00:: in previously established conditioned reflexes---conditioned_reflex%1:04:00:: resulted from repeated convulsive ( metrazol---metrazol%1:06:00:: ) treatments---treatment%1:04:00:: , suggesting a fundamental disturbance---disturbance%1:11:00:: in the balance---balance%1:26:00:: between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral processes .
It has further been shown that : ( 1 ) an experimental neurosis---neurosis%1:26:00:: in its initial stages---stage%1:26:00:: is associated with a reversible shift---shift%1:11:00:: in the central autonomic balance---balance%1:26:00:: ; ( 2 ) drugs---drug%1:06:00:: altering the hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: alter conditioned reactions---conditioned_reaction%1:04:00:: ; ( 3 ) in a state---state%1:03:00:: of depression---depression%1:26:00:: , the positive conditioned stimulus---conditioned_stimulus%1:09:00:: may fail to elicit a conditioned reaction---conditioned_reaction%1:04:00:: but cause an increased synchrony---synchrony%1:24:00:: instead of the excitatory desynchronizing---desynchronizing%1:24:00:: ( alerting---alerting%1:26:00:: ) effect---effect%1:19:00:: on the EEG---eeg%1:10:00:: .
These are few and seemingly disjointed data---data%1:14:00:: , but they illustrate the important fact---fact%1:09:01:: that fundamental alterations---alteration%1:11:00:: in conditioned reactions---conditioned_reaction%1:04:00:: occur in a variety---variety%1:14:01:: of states---state%1:03:00:: in which the hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: has been altered by physiological experimentation---experimentation%1:04:00:: , pharmacological action---action%1:26:00:: , or clinical processes .
The foregoing remarks---remark%1:10:00:: imply that the hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: plays a crucial role---role%1:04:00:: at the crossroads---crossroads%1:09:00:: between physiological and pathological forms---form%1:09:01:: of emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: .
If this is the case---case%1:09:00:: , one would expect that not only the various procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: just mentioned which alter the hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: would influence emotional state---emotional_state%1:26:00:: and behavior---behavior%1:07:00:: but that emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: itself would act likewise .
We pointed out that emotional excitement---excitement%1:04:00:: may lead to psychosomatic disorders---psychosomatic_disorder%1:26:00:: and neurotic symptoms---symptom%1:26:00:: , particularly in certain types---type%1:09:00:: of personality---personality%1:07:00:: , but it is also known that the reliving---reliving%1:09:00:: of a strong emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: ( `` abreaction---abreaction%1:04:00:: '' ) may cure a battle---battle%1:04:00:: neurosis---neurosis%1:26:00:: .
This phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: raises the question---question%1:10:00:: whether the guidance---guidance%1:04:00:: of the emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: for therapeutic ends---end%1:09:02:: may not have an even wider application---application%1:04:02:: in the area---area%1:09:00:: of the neuroses---neurosis%1:26:00:: .
Being a strictly physiological procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: , one may expect from such a study---study%1:04:00:: additional information---information%1:09:00:: on the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of the emotional process itself .
Wolpe---person%1:03:00:: 's experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: and therapeutic work---work%1:04:00:: lie in this area---area%1:09:00:: .
He showed convincingly that anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: is a learned---learned_reaction%1:04:00:: ( conditioned ) reaction---conditioned_reaction%1:04:00:: and is the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of experimental and clinical neuroses---neurosis%1:26:00:: and assumed , therefore , that the neuronal changes---change%1:24:00:: which underlie the neuroses---neurosis%1:26:00:: are functional and reversible .
An important observation---observation%1:04:00:: of Pavlov---person%1:03:00:: served as a guide post---guidepost%1:09:00:: to achieve such a reversibility---reversibility%1:07:00:: by physiological means---means%1:04:00:: .
In a conditioning---conditioning%1:09:00:: experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: , he demonstrated the antagonism between feeding---feeding%1:04:00:: and pain---pain%1:09:00:: .
A mild electrical shock---electrical_shock%1:04:00:: served as a conditioned stimulus---conditioned_stimulus%1:09:00:: and was followed by feeding---feeding%1:04:00:: .
The pain---pain%1:09:00:: became thus the symbol---symbol%1:10:00:: for food---food%1:03:00:: and elicited salivary secretion---secretion%1:22:00:: ( conditioned reflex---conditioned_reflex%1:04:00:: ) .
Even when the intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: of the shocks---shock%1:04:00:: was increased gradually , it failed to evoke any signs---sign%1:10:03:: of pain---pain%1:09:00:: .
Since strong nociceptive stimuli---stimulus%1:09:00:: produce an experimental neurosis---neurosis%1:26:00:: during which the animals---animal%1:03:00:: fail to eat in the experimental situation---situation%1:26:00:: , Wolpe---person%1:03:00:: thought that he could utilize the feeding---feeding%1:04:00:: pain---pain%1:09:00:: antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptoms---symptom%1:26:00:: through feeding---feeding%1:04:00:: .
Appropriate experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: showed that this is , indeed , possible .
He then applied this principle---principle%1:09:04:: of reciprocal inhibition---inhibition%1:07:00:: to human neuroses---neurosis%1:26:00:: .
He took advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness---assertiveness%1:07:00:: and anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: and found a relatively rapid disappearance---disappearance%1:04:01:: of anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: when the former attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: was established .
For the interpretation---interpretation%1:10:00:: of these significant investigations---investigation%1:09:00:: , it should be remembered that reciprocal relations---relation%1:03:00:: exist in the hypothalamus---hypothalamus%1:08:00:: with respect---respect%1:09:00:: to autonomic and somatic functions---function%1:07:00:: which are closely associated with the emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: .
The feeding---feeding%1:04:00:: pain---pain%1:09:00:: antagonism seems to be based on this reciprocal relation---relation%1:03:00:: between the tropho - and ergotropic systems---system%1:08:00:: .
Furthermore , a functional antagonism exists between an aggressive attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: and a state---state%1:03:00:: of anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: .
Although in both emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: sympathetic symptoms---symptom%1:26:00:: are present , different autonomic somatic patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: underlie aggression---aggression%1:07:00:: and anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: , respectively , as indicated by the rate---rate%1:28:00:: of the excretion---excretion%1:22:00:: of the catecholamines---catecholamine%1:27:00:: , the state---state%1:03:00:: of the muscle tone---muscle_tone%1:26:00:: , and the Mecholyl test .
The psychological incompatibility---incompatibility%1:24:02:: of these emotional states---emotional_state%1:26:00:: seems to be reflected in , or based on , this marked difference---difference%1:07:00:: .
In our attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to interpret the emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: in their physiological and pathological range---range%1:07:00:: , we emphasized the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of the degree---degree%1:26:01:: of activity---activity%1:26:00:: of the parasympathetic and sympathetic divisions---division%1:09:00:: of the hypothalamic system---system%1:08:00:: and their influence---influence%1:04:00:: on the inhibitory and excitatory systems---system%1:08:00:: , respectively .
We stressed the reciprocal relation---relation%1:03:00:: of these systems---system%1:08:00:: with respect---respect%1:09:00:: to the autonomic somatic downward discharge---discharge%1:11:00:: as well as regarding the hypothalamic cortical discharge---discharge%1:11:00:: .
Although we are still far from a complete understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of these problems---problem%1:10:00:: , as a first approximation---approximation%1:09:00:: , it is suggested that alterations---alteration%1:04:01:: in the hypothalamic balance---balance%1:26:00:: with consequent changes---change%1:11:00:: in the hypothalamic cortical discharges---discharge%1:11:00:: account for major changes---change%1:11:00:: in behavior---behavior%1:07:00:: seen in various moods---mood%1:12:00:: and states---state%1:03:00:: of emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: in man---man%1:05:01:: and beast---beast%1:03:00:: under physiological circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: , in experimental and clinical neurosis---neurosis%1:26:00:: , and as the result---result%1:19:00:: of psychopharmacological agents---agent%1:27:00:: .
In view of the important role---role%1:04:00:: which emotional disturbances---emotional_disturbance%1:26:00:: play in the genesis---genesis%1:11:00:: of neurotic and psychotic disorders---disorder%1:26:03:: and the parallelism---parallelism%1:07:00:: observed between autonomic states---state%1:03:00:: and psychological behavior---behavior%1:07:00:: in several instances---instance%1:11:00:: , it is further suggested that a hypothalamic imbalance---imbalance%1:26:00:: may play an important role---role%1:04:00:: in initiating mental changes---change%1:24:00:: .
I would not want to be one of those writers---writer%1:18:00:: who begin each morning---morning%1:28:00:: by exclaiming , `` O Gogol---person%1:03:00:: , O Chekhov---person%1:03:00:: , O Thackeray---person%1:03:00:: and Dickens---person%1:03:00:: , what would you have made of a bomb shelter---bomb_shelter%1:06:00:: ornamented with four plaster-of-Paris---plaster_of_paris%1:27:00:: ducks---duck%1:05:00:: , a birdbath---birdbath%1:06:00:: , and three composition---composition%1:27:00:: gnomes---gnome%1:18:00:: with long beards---beard%1:08:00:: and red mobcaps---mobcap%1:06:00:: '' ?
As I say , I would n't want to begin a day---day%1:28:02:: like this , but I often wonder what the dead---dead%1:14:00:: would have done .
But the shelter---shelter%1:06:00:: is as much a part---part%1:17:00:: of my landscape---landscape%1:15:00:: as the beech---beech%1:20:00:: and horse-chestnut---horse_chestnut%1:20:00:: trees---tree%1:20:00:: that grow on the ridge---ridge%1:17:00:: .
I can see it from this window---window%1:06:00:: where I write .
It was built by the Pasterns---person%1:03:00:: , and stands on the acre---acre%1:23:00:: of ground---ground%1:17:00:: that adjoins our property---property%1:21:00:: .
It bulks under a veil---veil%1:06:00:: of thin , new grass---grass%1:20:00:: , like some embarrassing fact---fact%1:09:01:: of physicalness---physicalness%1:07:00:: , and I think Mrs. Pastern---person%1:03:00:: set out the statuary---statuary%1:14:00:: to soften its meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: .
She was a pale woman---woman%1:18:00:: .
Sitting on her terrace---terrace%1:06:00:: , sitting in her parlor---parlor%1:06:00:: , sitting anywhere , she ground an axe of self-esteem---self-esteem%1:12:00:: .
Offer her a cup---cup%1:23:01:: of tea---tea%1:13:00:: and she would say , `` Why , these cups---cup%1:06:00:: look just like a set---set%1:14:00:: I gave to the Salvation Army---group%1:03:00:: last year---year%1:28:01:: '' .
Show her the new swimming pool---swimming_pool%1:06:00:: and she would say , slapping her ankle---ankle%1:08:00:: , `` I suppose this must be where you breed your gigantic mosquitoes---mosquito%1:05:00:: '' .
Hand her a chair---chair%1:06:00:: and she would say , `` Why , it 's a nice imitation---imitation%1:06:00:: of those Queen Anne chairs---chair%1:06:00:: I inherited from Grandmother Delancy---person%1:03:00:: '' .
These trumps were more touching than they were anything else , and seemed to imply that the nights---night%1:28:00:: were long , her children---child%1:18:01:: ungrateful , and her marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: bewilderingly threadbare .
Twenty years---year%1:28:01:: ago , she would have been known as a golf widow---golf_widow%1:18:00:: , and the sum---sum%1:09:00:: of her manner---manner%1:07:01:: was perhaps one of bereavement---bereavement%1:26:00:: .
She usually wore weeds---weeds%1:06:00:: , and a stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: watching her board a train---train%1:06:00:: might have guessed that Mr. Pastern---person%1:03:00:: was dead , but Mr. Pastern---person%1:03:00:: was far from dead .
He was marching up and down the locker room---locker_room%1:06:00:: of the Grassy Brae Golf Club---group%1:03:00:: shouting , `` Bomb Cuba---cuba%1:15:00:: !
Bomb Berlin---berlin%1:15:00:: !
Let 's throw a little nuclear hardware---hardware%1:06:02:: at them and show them who 's boss---boss%1:18:01:: '' .
He was brigadier---brigadier%1:18:00:: of the club---club%1:14:00:: 's locker-room---locker_room%1:06:00:: light infantry---infantry%1:14:00:: , and at one time---time%1:11:00:: or another declared war---war%1:26:00:: on Russia---russia%1:15:01:: , Czechoslovakia---czechoslovakia%1:15:00:: , Yugoslavia---yugoslavia%1:15:00:: , and China---china%1:15:00:: .
It all began on an autumn---autumn%1:28:00:: afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: - and who , after all these centuries---century%1:28:00:: , can describe the fineness---fineness%1:07:03:: of an autumn---autumn%1:28:00:: day---day%1:28:02:: ?
One might pretend never to have seen one before , or , to more purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: , that there would never be another like it .
The clear and searching sweep---sweep%1:07:00:: of sun---sun%1:17:00:: on the lawns---lawn%1:15:00:: was like a climax---climax%1:11:00:: of the year---year%1:28:01:: 's lights---light%1:26:00:: .
Leaves---leaf%1:20:00:: were burning somewhere and the smoke---smoke%1:22:00:: smelled , for all its ammoniac---ammoniac%1:27:00:: acidity---acidity%1:07:02:: , of beginnings---beginning%1:11:00:: .
The boundless blue air---blue_air%1:17:00:: was stretched over the zenith---zenith%1:15:01:: like the skin---skin%1:06:01:: of a drum---drum%1:06:00:: .
Leaving her house---house%1:06:00:: one late afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: , Mrs. Pastern---person%1:03:00:: stopped to admire the October---october%1:28:00:: light---light%1:07:01:: .
It was the day---day%1:28:01:: to canvass for infectious hepatitis---infectious_hepatitis%1:26:00:: .
Mrs. Pastern---person%1:03:00:: had been given sixteen names---name%1:10:00:: , a bundle---bundle%1:06:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: , and a printed book---book%1:10:00:: of receipts---receipt%1:10:00:: .
It was her work---work%1:04:01:: to go among her neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: and collect their checks---check%1:21:00:: .
Her house---house%1:06:00:: stood on a rise---rise%1:07:01:: of ground---ground%1:17:00:: , and before she got into her car---car%1:06:00:: she looked at the houses---house%1:06:00:: below .
Charity---charity%1:04:00:: as she knew it was complex and reciprocal , and almost every roof---roof%1:06:00:: she saw signified charity---charity%1:07:00:: .
Mrs. Balcolm---person%1:03:00:: worked for the brain---brain%1:08:00:: .
Mrs. Ten Eyke---person%1:03:00:: did mental health---mental_health%1:26:00:: .
Mrs. Trenchard---person%1:03:00:: worked for the blind---blind%1:14:00:: .
Mrs. Horowitz---person%1:03:00:: was in charge of diseases---disease%1:26:00:: of the nose---nose%1:08:00:: and throat---throat%1:08:00:: .
Mrs. Trempler---person%1:03:00:: was tuberculosis---tuberculosis%1:26:00:: , Mrs. Surcliffe---person%1:03:00:: was Mothers---mother%1:18:00:: ' March of Dimes , Mrs. Craven---person%1:03:00:: was cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: , and Mrs. Gilkson---person%1:03:00:: did the kidney---kidney%1:08:00:: .
Mrs. Hewlitt---person%1:03:00:: led the birthcontrol league---league%1:14:00:: , Mrs. Ryerson---person%1:03:00:: was arthritis---arthritis%1:26:00:: , and way in the distance---distance%1:15:00:: could be seen the slate roof---slate_roof%1:06:00:: of Ethel Littleton---person%1:03:00:: 's house---house%1:06:00:: , a roof---roof%1:06:00:: that signified gout---gout%1:26:00:: .
Mrs. Pastern---person%1:03:00:: undertook the work---work%1:04:00:: of going from house---house%1:06:00:: to house---house%1:06:00:: with the thoughtless resignation---resignation%1:12:00:: of an honest and traditional laborer---laborer%1:18:00:: .
It was her destiny---destiny%1:11:00:: ; it was her life---life%1:16:00:: .
Her mother---mother%1:18:00:: had done it before her , and even her old grandmother---grandmother%1:18:00:: , who had collected money---money%1:21:00:: for smallpox---smallpox%1:26:00:: and unwed mothers---mother%1:18:00:: .
Mrs. Pastern---person%1:03:00:: had telephoned most of her neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: in advance , and most of them were ready for her .
She experienced none of the suspense---suspense%1:09:00:: of some poor stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: selling encyclopedias---encyclopedia%1:10:00:: .
Here and there she stayed to visit and drink a glass---glass%1:23:00:: of sherry---sherry%1:13:00:: .
The contributions---contribution%1:04:00:: were ahead of what she had got the previous year---year%1:28:01:: , and while the money---money%1:21:00:: , of course , was not hers , it excited her to stuff her kit---kit%1:06:01:: with big checks---check%1:21:00:: .
She stopped at the Surcliffes---person%1:03:00:: ' after dusk---dusk%1:28:00:: , and had a Scotch-and-soda---scotch_and_soda%1:13:00:: .
She stayed too late , and when she left , it was dark and time---time%1:28:06:: to go home and cook supper---supper%1:13:00:: for her husband---husband%1:18:00:: .
`` I got a hundred and sixty dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: for the hepatitis---hepatitis%1:26:00:: fund---fund%1:21:00:: '' , she said excitedly when he walked in .
`` I did everybody on my list---list%1:10:00:: but the Blevins---person%1:03:00:: and the Flannagans---person%1:03:00:: .
I want to get my kit---kit%1:06:01:: in tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:00:: morning---morning%1:28:00:: - would you mind doing them while I cook the dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: '' ?
`` But I do n't know the Flannagans---person%1:03:00:: '' , Charlie Pastern---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Nobody does , but they gave me ten last year---year%1:28:01:: '' .
He was tired , he had his business---business%1:04:00:: worries---worry%1:12:00:: , and the sight---sight%1:09:01:: of his wife---wife%1:18:00:: arranging pork chops---porkchop%1:13:00:: in the broiler---broiler%1:06:00:: only seemed like an extension---extension%1:04:02:: of a boring day---day%1:28:01:: .
He was happy enough to take the convertible---convertible%1:06:00:: and race up the hill---hill%1:17:00:: to the Blevins---person%1:03:00:: ' , thinking that they might give him a drink---drink%1:13:04:: .
But the Blevins---person%1:03:00:: were away ; their maid---maid%1:18:01:: gave him an envelope---envelope%1:06:01:: with a check---check%1:21:00:: in it and shut the door---door%1:06:00:: .
Turning in at the Flannagans---person%1:03:00:: ' driveway---driveway%1:06:00:: , he tried to remember if he had ever met them .
The name---name%1:10:00:: encouraged him , because he always felt that he could handle the Irish .
There was a glass---glass%1:06:00:: pane---pane%1:06:00:: in the front door---front_door%1:06:00:: , and through this he could see into a hallway---hallway%1:06:00:: where a plump woman---woman%1:18:00:: with red hair---hair%1:08:00:: was arranging flowers---flower%1:20:00:: .
`` Infectious hepatitis---infectious_hepatitis%1:26:00:: '' , he shouted heartily .
She took a good look at herself in the mirror---mirror%1:06:00:: before she turned and , walking with very small steps---step%1:23:00:: , started toward the door---door%1:06:00:: .
The girlish voice---voice%1:10:00:: was nearly a whisper---whisper%1:10:00:: .
She was not a girl---girl%1:18:00:: , he could see .
Her hair---hair%1:08:00:: was dyed , and her bloom---bloom%1:28:00:: was fading , and she must have been crowding forty , but she seemed to be one of those women---woman%1:18:00:: who cling to the manners---manners%1:07:00:: and graces---grace%1:07:00:: of a pretty child---child%1:18:00:: of eight .
`` Your wife---wife%1:18:00:: just called '' , she said , separating one word---word%1:10:00:: from another , exactly like a child---child%1:18:00:: .
`` And I am not sure that I have any cash---cash%1:21:00:: - any money---money%1:21:00:: , that is - but if you will wait just a minute---minute%1:28:00:: I will write you out a check---check%1:21:00:: if I can find my checkbook---checkbook%1:21:00:: .
Wo n't you step into the living room---living_room%1:06:00:: , where it 's cozier '' ?
A fire---fire%1:22:00:: had just been lighted , he saw , and things---thing%1:06:00:: had been set out for drinks---drink%1:13:04:: , and , like any stray---stray%1:05:00:: , his response---response%1:04:01:: to these comforts---comforts%1:21:00:: was instantaneous .
Where was Mr. Flannagan---person%1:03:00:: , he wondered .
Travelling home on a late train---train%1:06:00:: ?
Changing his clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: upstairs ?
Taking a shower---shower%1:04:00:: ?
At the end---end%1:15:00:: of the room---room%1:06:00:: there was a desk---desk%1:06:00:: heaped with papers---papers%1:10:00:: , and she began to riffle these , making sighs---sigh%1:10:00:: and and noises---noise%1:11:00:: of girlish exasperation---exasperation%1:12:00:: .
`` I am terribly sorry to keep you waiting '' , she said , `` but won't you make yourself a little drink---drink%1:13:04:: while you wait ?
Everything 's on the table---table%1:06:01:: '' .
`` What train---train%1:06:00:: does Mr. Flannagan---person%1:03:00:: come out on '' ?
`` Mr. Flannagan---person%1:03:00:: is away '' , she said .
Her voice---voice%1:10:00:: dropped .
`` Mr. Flannagan---person%1:03:00:: has been away for six weeks---week%1:28:00:: '' .
`` I 'll have a drink---drink%1:13:04:: , then , if you 'll have one with me '' .
`` Sit down '' , he said , `` and enjoy your drink---drink%1:13:04:: and look for your checkbook---checkbook%1:21:00:: later .
The only way---way%1:04:01:: to find things---thing%1:06:00:: is to relax '' .
All in all , they had six drinks---drink%1:13:04:: .
She described herself and her circumstances---circumstances%1:26:02:: unhesitatingly .
Mr. Flannagan---person%1:03:00:: manufactured plastic---plastic%1:27:00:: tongue depressors---tongue_depressor%1:06:00:: .
He travelled all over the world---world%1:17:00:: .
Planes---plane%1:06:01:: made her feel faint , and in Tokyo---tokyo%1:15:00:: , where she had gone that summer---summer%1:28:00:: , she had been given raw fish---fish%1:13:00:: for breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: and so she had come straight home .
She and her husband---husband%1:18:00:: had formerly lived in New York---new_york%1:15:01:: , where she had many friends---friend%1:18:00:: , but Mr. Flannagan---person%1:03:00:: thought the country---country%1:15:01:: would be safer in case of war---war%1:26:00:: .
She would rather live in danger---danger%1:26:00:: than die of loneliness---loneliness%1:26:00:: and boredom---boredom%1:12:00:: .
She had no children---child%1:18:01:: ; she had made no friends---friend%1:18:00:: .
`` I 've seen you , though , before '' , she said with enormous coyness---coyness%1:07:00:: , patting his knee---knee%1:08:00:: .
`` I 've seen you walking your dogs---dog%1:05:00:: on Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: and driving by in the convertible---convertible%1:06:00:: '' .
The thought---thought%1:09:01:: of this lonely woman---woman%1:18:00:: sitting at her window---window%1:06:00:: touched him , although he was even more touched by her plumpness---plumpness%1:07:00:: .
Sheer plumpness---plumpness%1:07:00:: , he knew , is not a vital part---part%1:08:01:: of the body---body%1:08:00:: and has no procreative functions---function%1:07:00:: .
It serves merely as an excess cushion---cushion%1:06:01:: for the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the carcass---carcass%1:05:00:: .
And knowing its humble place---place%1:26:00:: in the scale---scale%1:24:03:: of things---thing%1:09:00:: , why did he , at this time of life---time_of_life%1:28:00:: , seem almost ready to sell his soul---soul%1:18:00:: for plumpness---plumpness%1:07:00:: ?
The remarks---remark%1:10:00:: she made about the sufferings---suffering%1:12:02:: of a lonely woman---woman%1:18:00:: seemed so broad at first that he did n't know what to make of them , but after the sixth drink---drink%1:13:04:: he put his arm---arm%1:08:00:: around her and suggested that they go upstairs and look for her checkbook---checkbook%1:21:00:: there .
Her voice---voice%1:10:00:: shook with feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: , and he thought it lovely .
He did n't doubt her truthfulness---truthfulness%1:07:00:: , although he had heard the words---words%1:10:03:: a hundred times .
`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , shaking their dresses---dress%1:06:00:: down over their white shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , waiting for the elevator---elevator%1:06:00:: in the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: corridor---corridor%1:06:00:: .
`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , pouring another whiskey---whiskey%1:13:00:: .
`` I 've never done this before '' , they always said , putting on their stockings---stocking%1:06:00:: .
On ships---ship%1:06:00:: at sea , on railroad trains---railroad_train%1:06:00:: , in summer---summer%1:28:00:: hotels---hotel%1:06:00:: with mountain---mountain%1:17:00:: views---view%1:09:01:: , they always said , `` I 've never done this before '' .
Mrs. Pastern---person%1:03:00:: asked sadly , when he came in .
`` I had a drink---drink%1:13:04:: with the Flannagans---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` She told me he was in Germany---germany%1:15:00:: '' .
Charlie---person%1:03:00:: ate some supper---supper%1:13:00:: in the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: and went into the TV room---tv_room%1:06:00:: to hear the news---news%1:10:02:: .
`` Throw a little nuclear hardware---hardware%1:06:02:: at them !
Show them who 's boss---boss%1:18:01:: '' !
But in bed---bed%1:06:00:: he had trouble---trouble%1:11:00:: sleeping .
He thought first of his son---son%1:18:00:: and daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: , away at college---college%1:14:00:: .
It was the only meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: of the word---word%1:10:00:: that he had ever known .
Then he played nine imaginary holes---hole%1:06:01:: of golf---golf%1:04:00:: , choosing his handicap---handicap%1:07:02:: , his irons---iron%1:06:01:: , his stance---stance%1:07:00:: , his opponents---opponent%1:18:02:: , and his weather---weather%1:19:00:: in detail , but the green---green%1:07:00:: of the links---links%1:06:00:: seemed faded in the light---light%1:18:00:: of his business---business%1:04:00:: worries---worry%1:09:00:: .
His money---money%1:21:02:: was tied up in a Nassau---nassau%1:15:00:: hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: , an Ohio---ohio%1:15:00:: pottery---pottery%1:04:00:: works---works%1:06:02:: , and a detergent---detergent%1:06:00:: for window-washing---window-washing%1:04:00:: , and luck---luck%1:26:00:: had been running against him .
His worries---worry%1:09:00:: harried him up out of bed---bed%1:06:00:: , and he lighted a cigarette---cigarette%1:06:00:: and went to the window---window%1:06:00:: .
In the starlight---starlight%1:19:00:: he could see the trees---tree%1:20:00:: stripped of their leaves---leaf%1:20:00:: .
During the summer---summer%1:28:00:: he had tried to repair some of his losses---losses%1:21:00:: at the track---track%1:06:05:: , and the bare trees---tree%1:20:00:: reminded him that his pari-mutuel---parimutuel%1:04:00:: tickets---ticket%1:10:01:: would still be lying , like leaves---leaf%1:20:00:: , in the gutters---gutter%1:06:00:: near Belmont---location%1:03:00:: and Saratoga---location%1:03:00:: .
Maple---maple%1:20:02:: and ash---ash%1:20:00:: , beech---beech%1:20:00:: and elm---elm%1:20:00:: , one hundred to win---win%1:11:00:: on Three---three%1:23:00:: in the fourth---fourth%1:24:00:: , fifty to win---win%1:11:00:: on Six---six%1:23:00:: in the third---third%1:24:00:: , one hundred to win on Two---two%1:23:00:: in the eighth .
Children---child%1:18:00:: walking home from school---school%1:06:00:: would scuff through what seemed to be his foliage---foliage%1:20:00:: .
Then , getting back into bed---bed%1:06:00:: , he thought unashamedly of Mrs. Flannagan---person%1:03:00:: , planning where they would next meet and what they would do .
There are , he thought , so few true means---means%1:04:00:: of forgetfulness---forgetfulness%1:09:00:: in this life---life%1:28:00:: that why should he shun the medicine---medicine%1:06:00:: even when the medicine---medicine%1:06:00:: seemed , as it did , a little crude ?
If the crummy bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: could write !
It 's those two fucken niggers---nigger%1:18:00:: !
Nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: pussy---pussy%1:08:00:: .
He thought of sweet wet nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: pussy---pussy%1:08:00:: .
Oh , sweet land of heaven , haint there just nothin like sweet nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: pussy---pussy%1:08:00:: !
He had caught her coming out of the shack---shack%1:06:00:: .
Man how I love nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: pussy---pussy%1:08:00:: !
The snow---snow%1:19:00:: came a little faster now , he noted .
He thought of Joe Harris---person%1:03:00:: , the nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: who had gone after his sister---sister%1:18:00:: .
He chuckled , the memory---memory%1:09:01:: vivid .
The snow---snow%1:19:00:: again .
If only the fucken weather---weather%1:19:00:: was n't so lousy !
Goddamn niggers---nigger%1:18:00:: , Lord .
Sonuvabitch , I can n't figure out what in hell---hell%1:15:01:: for they went and put niggers---nigger%1:18:00:: in my squad---squad%1:14:01:: for .
Only one worth---worth%1:07:00:: a shit , and that 's Brandon---person%1:03:00:: .
His thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: turned to other things---thing%1:09:02:: .
The big shock---shock%1:12:01:: everybody had when they found ol Slater---person%1:03:00:: and those others done for .
But he soon saw which way---way%1:15:00:: the ball---ball%1:06:01:: was bouncing .
Soon came back to his senses---sense%1:09:05:: .
`` I soon came back to my senses---sense%1:09:05:: '' , he said , aloud , to the young blizzard---blizzard%1:19:00:: , proudly , drawing himself up , as if making a report---report%1:10:01:: to some important superior---superior%1:18:02:: .
I was the first---first%1:24:00:: to get my squad---squad%1:14:01:: on the ball , and anybody thinkin it was easy is pretty damn dumb .
That goddamn redheader---redheader%1:18:00:: was the worst .
`` They 'll get the guys---guy%1:18:00:: that done it .
That 'll put the place---place%1:15:01:: back to normal .
Maybe it 's a good thing---thing%1:26:00:: it happened .
Clean the place---place%1:15:01:: up .
I hear the whole bunch---bunch%1:14:01:: is croakin out in the snow---snow%1:19:00:: .
They 'll get the guys---guy%1:18:00:: that done it '' .
Five days---day%1:28:00:: .
Prickly twinges---twinge%1:12:00:: of annoyance---annoyance%1:26:00:: ran through him .
His eyes---eye%1:08:00:: blinked hard , snapping on and squashing some bad things---thing%1:26:00:: that were trying to push their way---way%1:23:00:: into him .
A tune---tune%1:10:00:: began to whirl inside his head---head%1:08:00:: .
One of his favorites---favorite%1:09:00:: : `` Guitar Boogie '' .
It always came on , faithfully , just like a radio---radio%1:06:01:: or juke box---jukebox%1:06:00:: , whenever he started to worry too much about something , when the bad things---thing%1:26:00:: tried to push their way---way%1:23:00:: into him .
The music---music%1:10:00:: drove them off , or away , and he was free to walk on air in a very few moments---moment%1:28:00:: , humming and jiving within , beating the rhythm---rhythm%1:10:01:: within .
He glowed with anticipation---anticipation%1:12:00:: about what would happen to the culprits---culprit%1:18:00:: when they caught them .
Turn the bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: over to me - to me and my boys---boy%1:18:01:: - no nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: ever got what would be comin to them - reactionary bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: .
He had never heard the word---word%1:10:00:: reactionary---reactionary%1:18:00:: before his life---life%1:26:02:: as a POW---pow%1:18:00:: began .
It was a word---word%1:10:00:: he was proud of , a word---word%1:10:00:: that meant much to him , and he used it with great pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: , almost as if it were an exclusive possession---possession%1:03:00:: , and more : he sensed himself to be very highly educated , four cuts above any of the folks---folk%1:14:00:: back home .
The word---word%1:10:00:: also made him feel hate---hate%1:12:00:: , sincere hate---hate%1:12:00:: , for those so labeled .
He used it very effectively when he wanted to get his squad---squad%1:14:01:: on the ball .
It came up again and again in the discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: sessions---session%1:10:00:: .
Lousy Reactionary bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: been tryin to fuck up the Program---program%1:09:00:: for months---month%1:28:00:: .
Months---month%1:28:00:: .
Hired , hard lackeys---lackey%1:18:00:: of the Warmongering---warmongering%1:09:00:: Capitalists---capitalist%1:18:01:: .
To fuck up the Program---program%1:09:00:: .
You guys---guy%1:18:00:: remember that .
He saw himself before them delivering the speech---speech%1:10:01:: .
He laughed , suddenly , feeling a surge---surge%1:11:00:: of power---power%1:07:00:: telling him of his hold---hold%1:07:00:: over them , seeing himself before them , receiving utmost respect---respect%1:26:00:: and attention---attention%1:04:02:: .
One day---day%1:28:03:: , Ching---person%1:03:00:: had told him ( smiling , patting him on the back---back%1:08:00:: ) as they walked to the weekly conference---conference%1:10:00:: of squad---squad%1:14:01:: leaders---leader%1:18:00:: , `` Keep it up , your squad---squad%1:14:01:: is good , one of the best , keep it up , keep up the good work---work%1:04:00:: '' .
That was really something , coming from Ching---person%1:03:00:: .
Dirty Reactionary bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: comin down here in the night---night%1:28:00:: and bumpin off ol Slater---person%1:03:00:: and those other poor bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: .
`` They 'll get them by God and let them bring them down here to me , just let them , God I 'll slice their balls---ball%1:08:01:: right off '' .
His arm---arm%1:08:00:: moved swiftly , violently , once , twice .
He felt intense satisfaction---satisfaction%1:12:00:: .
Before him , mutilated , bleeding to death---death%1:26:00:: , they lay .
`` Bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: '' , he said aloud , spitting on them .
Rivers---river%1:17:00:: of cold sweat---cold_sweat%1:26:00:: were suddenly unleashed within him .
The thought---thought%1:09:01:: came back , the one nagging at him these past four days---day%1:28:01:: .
But the words---word%1:10:00:: were forming .
He fought it , seeking to kill the last few words---word%1:10:00:: , but on they came `` bout takin - his '' .
He was trembling , a strange feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: upon him , fully expecting some catastrophe---catastrophe%1:11:00:: to strike him dead on the spot .
And he took heart ; the final word---word%1:10:00:: came forth `` place---place%1:04:01:: '' .
Now---now%1:28:00:: he heard it , fully : `` bout takin his place---place%1:04:01:: '' .
He listened , waited , nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: happened .
His old self---self%1:18:00:: .
The music---music%1:10:00:: arrived , taking him , its rhythm---rhythm%1:10:01:: stroked him , snaked all through him , the lyrics---lyric%1:10:01:: lifted him , took him from one magic isle---isle%1:17:00:: to another , stopping briefly at each .
Brandon---person%1:03:00:: .
But a nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: .
Johnson---person%1:03:00:: .
Jesus , the guy---guy%1:18:00:: says he is trying .
When I talked to Ching---person%1:03:00:: about it , he said , Everyone can learn , if he is not a Reactionary---reactionary%1:18:00:: or lazy .
It is plain as hell---hell%1:15:01:: Johnson---person%1:03:00:: is no Reactionary---reactionary%1:18:00:: .
So you 're not tryin , Johnson---person%1:03:00:: , you bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: you .
He looked over at him , lying there , asleep , and he felt a wave---wave%1:04:02:: of revulsion---revulsion%1:12:00:: .
Sleepy-eyed , soft-spoken Johnson---person%1:03:00:: .
Biggest thorn---thorn%1:09:00:: in my side---side%1:08:00:: of the whole fucken squad---squad%1:14:01:: .
He was the guy---guy%1:18:00:: what always goofed at Question---question%1:10:00:: Time---time%1:28:06:: .
Why could n't they have dumped him off on someone---someone%1:03:00:: else ?
Why did n't the damn Reactionaries---reactionary%1:18:00:: bump him off ?
Why Slater---person%1:03:00:: ?
Like a particle---particle%1:27:01:: drawn to a magnet---magnet%1:06:00:: he returned to that which was pressing so hard in his mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
The music---music%1:10:00:: surged up , but it failed to check it .
Who is the man---man%1:18:00:: to take His place---place%1:04:01:: ?
The guy---guy%1:18:00:: with most on the Ball .
Handle men---man%1:18:00:: .
With a supreme effort---effort%1:04:00:: , he broke it off .
He turned to the window---window%1:06:00:: again .
The snow---snow%1:19:00:: was tumbling down furiously now .
Huge glob-flakes hitting the ground---ground%1:17:00:: , piling higher and higher .
The whole fucken sky---sky%1:17:00:: 's cavin in !
Cover the whole building---building%1:06:00:: , bury us all , by nightfall---nightfall%1:28:00:: .
I know they 're waitin only for one thing---thing%1:11:00:: :
for the bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: what done it to be nailed .
He was again tingling with pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: , seeing himself clearly in Slater---person%1:03:00:: 's shoes---shoes%1:26:00:: .
Top dog---top_dog%1:18:00:: , sleeping and eating right there with the Staff---person%1:03:00:: .
Ching---person%1:03:00:: , Tien---person%1:03:00:: , all of them .
Top dog---top_dog%1:18:00:: .
Poor ol Slater---person%1:03:00:: .
Jesus , imagine , the crummy bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: , they 'll get em , they 'll get what 's comin to em * * h He whirled about suddenly .
It was nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: , though his heart---heart%1:08:00:: was thumping wildly .
`` Boy , you 're stirrin early '' , a sleepy voice---voice%1:10:00:: said .
`` Yehhh '' , said Coughlin---person%1:03:00:: , testily , eyeing him up and down .
`` Lookit that come down , willya '' , said the man---man%1:18:00:: , scratching himself , yawning .
`` Yehhh '' , said Coughlin---person%1:03:00:: , practically spitting on him .
The man---man%1:18:00:: moved away .
That 's the way---way%1:04:01:: .
Keep the chatter---chatter%1:10:00:: to a minimum , short answers---answer%1:10:01:: , one word---word%1:10:00:: , if possible .
Less bull---bull%1:10:00:: the more you can do with um .
That 's Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: .
All he does is to bullshit with his squad---squad%1:14:01:: , and they are the stupidest bastards---bastard%1:18:00:: around .
Just about to get their asses---ass%1:08:00:: kicked into hut---hut%1:06:01:: Seven .
Plenty---plenty%1:07:00:: of room---room%1:23:00:: there now .
All those dumb 8 - Balls---ball%1:06:01:: croaked .
They 'd cut their mothers---mother%1:18:00:: ' belly---belly%1:08:00:: open .
Give um the works---works%1:26:00:: .
See , he 's already snapping it up , the dumb jerk---jerk%1:18:00:: * * h Coughlin---person%1:03:00:: grinned , feeling supremely on top of things---thing%1:26:00:: * * h He watched the snow---snow%1:19:00:: once again .
It made no sense to him * * h He whirled around , suddenly hot all over , finding the man---man%1:18:00:: who had been standing before him a few moments---moment%1:28:00:: back , nailing him to the spot---spot%1:15:01:: on which he now stood , open-mouthed -
- name William Foster---person%1:03:00:: 's Four Internal Contradictions in Capitalism---capitalism%1:14:00:: .
The man---man%1:18:00:: shrank before the hot fury---fury%1:26:00:: , searching frantically for the answer---answer%1:10:01:: * * h Finnegan---person%1:03:00:: woke up .
There was a hell of a noise---noise%1:11:00:: this time---time%1:11:00:: of morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
He stared out the window---window%1:06:00:: .
The whole fucken sky---sky%1:17:00:: 's caved in !
He looked for the source---source%1:18:00:: of the noise---noise%1:11:00:: that had awakened him * * h It was that prick---prick%1:18:00:: Coughlin---person%1:03:00:: .
What the hell---hell%1:15:01:: was he up to now ?
How did they miss him when they got Slater---person%1:03:00:: ?
* * h Then he was asking himself the usual early morning---morning%1:28:00:: questions---question%1:10:00:: : What the Hell---hell%1:15:01:: am I doin here ?
Is this a nut-house---nuthouse%1:06:00:: ?
Am I nuts---nut%1:18:00:: ?
* * h From somewhere in the hut---hut%1:06:01:: came Coughlin---person%1:03:00:: 's voice---voice%1:07:00:: .
How long , buddy---buddy%1:18:00:: '' ?
`` For Christ's sake '' ! a voice---voice%1:10:00:: pleaded .
`` Do n't Christsake me , buddy---buddy%1:18:00:: !
* * h I'm no hero---hero%1:18:00:: .
Did I start the damn war---war%1:04:00:: ?
* * h Automatically , Finnegan---person%1:03:00:: started going over today---today%1:28:00:: 's lesson---lesson%1:04:00:: * * h Capitalism---capitalism%1:14:00:: rots from the core---core%1:15:00:: .
Did I start the damn war---war%1:04:00:: ?
Why do n't Uncle Sam---uncle_sam%1:18:00:: mind his own fucken business---business%1:09:01:: ?
Just let me go home to Jersey---location%1:03:00:: , back to the shore---shore%1:17:00:: , oh , Jesus---person%1:03:00:: , the shore---shore%1:17:00:: .
The waves---wave%1:11:01:: breakin in on you and your girl---girl%1:18:01:: at night---night%1:28:00:: there on the warm beach---beach%1:17:00:: in the moonlight---moonlight%1:19:00:: even Jesus---person%1:03:00:: sweet Mary---person%1:03:00:: .
If I hafta do this to stay alive by God---person%1:03:00:: I 'll do it .
I hated the goddamn army---army%1:14:00:: from the first day---day%1:28:03:: I got in anyhow .
All pricks---prick%1:18:00:: like Coughlin---person%1:03:00:: run it anyway , one way---way%1:07:01:: or another .
Fuck them * * h He rolled over and tried to shut out the noise---noise%1:11:00:: , now much louder .
He snuggled into the blanket---blanket%1:06:00:: * * h Brandon---person%1:03:00:: dreamed .
He was sitting on top---top%1:15:00:: of a log---log%1:27:01:: which was spinning round and around in the water---water%1:17:00:: .
A river---river%1:17:00:: , wide as the Missouri---missouri%1:17:00:: , where it ran by his place---place%1:15:04:: .
The log---log%1:27:01:: was spinning .
Why should I be spinning just because the goddamn log---log%1:27:01:: is spinning ?
( he asked this out loud , but no one heard it over the other noise---noise%1:11:00:: in the hut---hut%1:06:01:: ) .
Over on the bank---bank%1:17:01:: , the west bank---bank%1:17:01:: , a man---man%1:18:00:: stood , calling to him .
No doubt it had to do with the log---log%1:27:01:: .
Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: in English---english%1:10:00:: has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use---use%1:04:00:: of words---word%1:10:00:: , unless it be the ambiguous use---use%1:04:00:: of sentences---sentence%1:10:00:: .
Ben Franklin---person%1:03:00:: said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr. Fogg---person%1:03:00:: .
You explain English---english%1:10:00:: by Greek---greek%1:10:00:: '' .
Richard Brinsley Sheridan---person%1:03:00:: said , `` I think the interpreter---interpreter%1:18:01:: is the hardest to be understood of the two '' .
And a witty American journalist---journalist%1:18:00:: remarked over a century---century%1:28:00:: ago what is even more true today---today%1:28:00:: , `` Many a writer---writer%1:18:00:: seems to think he is never profound except when he can n't understand his own meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: '' .
There are many types---type%1:09:00:: of ambiguity---ambiguity%1:10:00:: and many of them have been described by rhetoricians---rhetorician%1:18:00:: under such names---name%1:10:00:: as amphibology---amphibology%1:10:00:: , parisology---parisology%1:10:00:: , and other ologies---ology%1:09:00:: .
In common parlance---parlance%1:10:00:: they would be described as misses---miss%1:11:00:: - misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds---misdeed%1:04:00:: .
One species---species%1:09:00:: of ambiguity---ambiguity%1:10:00:: tries to baffle by interweaving repetition---repetition%1:10:00:: .
`` Did you or did you not say what I said you said , because Jane---person%1:03:00:: said you never said what I said '' ?
Another woman---woman%1:18:00:: , addressing Christmas cards---christmas_card%1:10:00:: , said to her husband---husband%1:18:00:: : `` We sent them one last year---year%1:28:01:: but they did n't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year---year%1:28:01:: because they 'll think we won't send them one because they did n't last year---year%1:28:01:: , do n't you think , or shall we '' ?
Such ambiguous exercises---exercise%1:04:03:: compound confusion---confusion%1:09:00:: by making it worse compounded , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream---cream%1:14:00:: of the jest---jest%1:10:00:: sours .
Ambiguity---ambiguity%1:10:00:: of a non repetitious kind---kind%1:09:00:: describes the dilemma---dilemma%1:09:00:: one girl---girl%1:18:00:: found herself in .
`` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend---girlfriend%1:18:01:: .
`` I wrote Bill---person%1:03:00:: in my last letter---letter%1:10:00:: to forget that I had told him that I did n't mean to reconsider my decision---decision%1:04:00:: not to change my mind---mind%1:09:04:: - and he seems to have misunderstood me '' .
Evidently Bill---person%1:03:00:: was another of those men---man%1:18:00:: who simply do n't understand women---woman%1:18:00:: .
Another case---case%1:11:00:: involves a newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: reporter---reporter%1:18:00:: who tripped up a politician---politician%1:18:01:: .
`` Mr. Jones---person%1:03:00:: , you may recall that we printed last week---week%1:28:00:: your denial---denial%1:10:01:: of having retracted the contradiction---contradiction%1:24:00:: of your original statement---statement%1:10:00:: .
Questions---question%1:10:00:: like this , framed in verbal fog---fog%1:09:00:: , are perhaps the only kind---kind%1:09:00:: that have ever stumped an experienced politician---politician%1:18:01:: .
They recall Byron---person%1:03:00:: 's classic comment---comment%1:10:00:: : `` I wish he would explain his explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: '' .
Similarly , when a reporter---reporter%1:18:00:: once questioned Lincoln---person%1:03:00:: in cryptic fashion---fashion%1:04:00:: , Lincoln---person%1:03:00:: refused to make any further statement---statement%1:10:00:: .
`` I fear explanations---explanation%1:10:00:: explanatory of things---thing%1:10:00:: explained '' , he said , leaving the biter---biter%1:18:00:: bit - and bitter .
The obscurity---obscurity%1:07:02:: of politicians---politician%1:18:01:: may not always be as innocent as it looks .
`` Senator---senator%1:18:00:: '' , said an interviewer---interviewer%1:18:00:: , `` your constituents---constituent%1:18:00:: can n't understand from your speech---speech%1:10:01:: last night---night%1:28:00:: just how you stand on the question---question%1:10:01:: '' .
replied the Senator---senator%1:18:00:: .
`` It took me five hours---hour%1:28:00:: to write it that way---way%1:07:01:: '' .
The misplaced modifier---modifier%1:10:00:: is another species---species%1:09:00:: more honored in the observance---observance%1:04:00:: of obscurity---obscurity%1:07:02:: than in the breach---breach%1:04:01:: .
This creates an amusing effect---effect%1:19:00:: because its position---position%1:15:00:: in a sentence---sentence%1:10:00:: seems to make it apply to the wrong word---word%1:10:00:: .
A verse---verse%1:10:01:: familiar to all grammarians---grammarian%1:18:00:: is the quatrain---quatrain%1:10:00:: :
`` I saw a man---man%1:18:00:: once beat his wife---wife%1:18:00:: When on a drunken spree---spree%1:04:00:: .
Now can you tell me who was drunk - The man---man%1:18:00:: , his wife---wife%1:18:00:: , or me '' ?
The `` wooden-leg---wooden_leg%1:06:00:: '' gag---gag%1:10:00:: of vaudeville---vaudeville%1:10:00:: , another standby---standby%1:06:00:: of this sort---sort%1:09:00:: , had endless variations---variation%1:04:00:: .
`` '' There 's a man---man%1:18:00:: outside with a wooden leg---wooden_leg%1:06:00:: named Smith---person%1:03:00:: `` .
'' What 's the name---name%1:10:00:: of his other leg---leg%1:08:01:: `` '' ?
Another stock vaudeville---vaudeville%1:10:00:: gag---gag%1:10:00:: ran : `` Mother---mother%1:18:00:: is home sick in bed---bed%1:06:00:: with the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: '' .
When radio---radio%1:10:00:: came in , it continued the misplaced modifier---modifier%1:10:00:: in its routines---routine%1:10:01:: as a standard device---device%1:04:00:: .
`` '' Do you see that pretty girl---girl%1:18:00:: standing next to the car---car%1:06:00:: with slacks---slacks%1:06:00:: on `` ?
'' I see the girl---girl%1:18:00:: but I do n't see the car---car%1:06:00:: with slacks---slacks%1:06:00:: on `` '' .
In recent years---year%1:28:01:: gagwriters---gagwriter%1:18:00:: have discovered this brand---brand%1:10:00:: of blunder---blunder%1:04:00:: and thus the misplaced modifier---modifier%1:10:00:: has acquired a new habitat---habitat%1:15:00:: in the gagline---gag_line%1:10:00:: .
In one cartoon---cartoon%1:10:00:: a family---family%1:14:02:: is shown outside a theater---theater%1:06:00:: with the head---head%1:18:00:: of the family---family%1:14:02:: addressing the doorman---doorman%1:18:00:: : `` Excuse me , but when we came out we found that we had left my daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: 's handbag---handbag%1:06:00:: and my wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's behind '' .
Journalism---journalism%1:10:00:: supplies us with an endless run---run%1:14:00:: of such slips---slip%1:04:02:: .
Not long ago a newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: advised those taking part in a contest---contest%1:11:00:: that `` snapshots---snapshot%1:06:00:: must be of a person---person%1:03:00:: not larger than * * f inches---inch%1:23:00:: '' .
Classified ads---ad%1:10:00:: are also chockfull of misrelated constructions---construction%1:10:01:: .
Readers---reader%1:18:02:: of the Reader 's Digest are familiar with such items---item%1:06:00:: which often appear in its lists---list%1:10:00:: of verbal slips---slip%1:04:02:: , like the ad---ad%1:10:00:: in a California---california%1:15:00:: paper---paper%1:10:03:: that advertised `` House---house%1:06:00:: for rent---rent%1:21:00:: .
View---view%1:09:01:: takes in five counties---county%1:15:00:: , two bedrooms---bedroom%1:06:00:: '' .
Since brevity---brevity%1:10:00:: is the soul---soul%1:04:00:: of ambiguity---ambiguity%1:10:00:: as well as wit---wit%1:10:00:: , newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: headlines---headline%1:10:00:: continually provide us with amusing samples---sample%1:09:00:: .
`` Officials---official%1:18:01:: Meet on Rubbish---rubbish%1:27:00:: .
Many Shapes---shape%1:07:01:: in Bathtubs---bathtub%1:06:00:: .
Son---son%1:18:00:: and Daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: of Local Couple---couple%1:14:01:: Married '' .
Apart from misplaced modifiers---modifier%1:10:00:: and headlinese---headlinese%1:10:00:: , journalism---journalism%1:10:00:: contributes a wide variety---variety%1:14:01:: of comic ambiguities---ambiguity%1:10:00:: in both editorial---editorial%1:10:00:: and advertising---advertising%1:10:00:: matter---matter%1:09:00:: .
A weekly newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: reported a local romance---romance%1:26:00:: : `` and the couple---couple%1:14:00:: were married last Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: , thus ending a friendship---friendship%1:26:00:: which began in their schooldays---schooldays%1:28:00:: '' .
An item---item%1:06:00:: in the letters---letter%1:10:00:: column---column%1:10:00:: of a newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: renewed a subscription---subscription%1:21:00:: , adding : `` I personally enjoy your newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: as much as my husband---husband%1:18:00:: '' .
Then there was the caterer---caterer%1:18:00:: 's ad---ad%1:10:00:: which read : `` Are you getting married or having an affair---affair%1:26:00:: ?
We have complete facilities---facility%1:06:00:: to accommodate 200 people---people%1:14:00:: '' .
The newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: too is the favorite habitat---habitat%1:15:00:: of the anatomical .
This slip---slip%1:04:02:: is so-called because its semi ambiguous English---english%1:10:00:: always seems to refer to a person---person%1:03:00:: 's anatomy---anatomy%1:08:00:: but never quite means what it seems to say .
Samples---sample%1:09:00:: :
He walked in upon her invitation---invitation%1:10:00:: .
She kissed him passionately upon his reappearance---reappearance%1:11:00:: .
Not without good reason---reason%1:16:00:: has the anatomical been called jocular journalese---journalese%1:10:00:: .
In news---news%1:10:01:: items---item%1:06:00:: a man---man%1:18:00:: is less often shot in the body---body%1:08:01:: or head---head%1:08:00:: than in the suburbs---suburb%1:15:00:: .
`` While Henry Morgan---person%1:03:00:: was escorting Miss Vera Green---person%1:03:00:: from the church---church%1:06:00:: social---social%1:14:00:: last Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: , a savage dog---dog%1:05:00:: attacked them and bit Mr. Morgan---person%1:03:00:: on the public square---public_square%1:15:00:: '' .
Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star : `` The area---area%1:08:00:: in which Miss N - was injured is spectacularly scenic '' .
Such items---item%1:06:00:: recall the California---california%1:15:00:: journalist---journalist%1:18:00:: who reported an accident---accident%1:11:01:: involving a movie star---movie_star%1:18:00:: : `` The area---area%1:15:01:: in which Miss N---person%1:03:00:: - was injured is spectacularly scenic '' .
The double meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: in the anatomical---anatomical%1:10:00:: made it a familiar vaudeville---vaudeville%1:10:00:: device---device%1:04:00:: , as in the gags---gag%1:10:00:: of Weber---person%1:03:00:: and Fields---person%1:03:00:: .
When a witness---witness%1:18:00:: at court---court%1:06:02:: was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus---rumpus%1:04:00:: , he replied , `` No , it was in the stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: '' .
Apart from journalese---journalese%1:10:00:: and vaudeville---vaudeville%1:10:00:: gags---gag%1:10:00:: , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature---literature%1:10:00:: .
A conscientious girl---girl%1:18:00:: became the secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: of a doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: .
Her first day---day%1:28:01:: at work---work%1:06:01:: she was puzzled by an entry---entry%1:10:01:: in the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's notes---note%1:10:00:: on an emergency---emergency%1:11:00:: case---case%1:18:03:: .
It read : `` Shot in the lumbar region---region%1:15:00:: '' .
After a moment---moment%1:28:01:: of thought---thought%1:09:00:: , her mind---mind%1:09:00:: cleared and , in the interest---interest%1:07:01:: of clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: , she typed into the record---record%1:10:03:: : `` Shot in the woods---woods%1:14:00:: '' .
There are many grammatical misconstructions---misconstruction%1:10:00:: other than dangling modifiers---dangling_modifier%1:10:00:: and anatomicals---anatomical%1:10:00:: which permit two different interpretations---interpretation%1:09:01:: .
At the home---home%1:06:00:: of a gourmet---gourmet%1:18:00:: the new maid---maid%1:18:01:: was instructed in the fine points---point%1:07:01:: of serving .
`` I want the fish---fish%1:13:00:: served whole , with head---head%1:08:00:: and tail---tail%1:05:00:: '' , the epicure---epicure%1:18:00:: explained , `` and serve it with lemon---lemon%1:13:00:: in mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: '' .
The maid---maid%1:18:01:: demurred .
`` That 's silly - lemon---lemon%1:13:00:: in mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: '' , she said .
But since the gourmet---gourmet%1:18:00:: insisted that it is done that way---way%1:07:01:: at the most fashionable dinners---dinner%1:14:00:: , the girl---girl%1:18:00:: reluctantly agreed .
So she brought the fish---fish%1:13:00:: in whole , and she carried a lemon---lemon%1:13:00:: in her mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: .
Another specimen---specimen%1:09:00:: of such double-entendre---double_entendre%1:10:00:: is illustrated by a woman---woman%1:18:00:: in a department store---department_store%1:06:00:: .
She said to the saleslady---saleslady%1:18:00:: , `` I want a dress---dress%1:06:00:: to put on around the house---house%1:06:00:: '' .
The puzzled saleslady---saleslady%1:18:00:: inquired , `` How large is your house---house%1:06:00:: , Madam---madam%1:18:00:: '' ?
This saleslady---saleslady%1:18:00:: was a failure---failure%1:18:00:: in the dress---dress%1:06:00:: department---department%1:14:00:: and was transferred to the shoe---shoe%1:06:00:: department---department%1:14:00:: .
When a customer---customer%1:18:00:: asked for alligator---alligator%1:27:00:: shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: , she said , `` What size---size%1:07:00:: is your alligator---alligator%1:05:00:: '' ?
The comic indefinite comprises an extensive class---class%1:14:00:: of comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: .
One species---species%1:09:00:: is restricted to statements---statement%1:10:00:: which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person---person%1:03:00:: , place---place%1:15:01:: , time---time%1:28:00:: or thing---thing%1:06:00:: .
A woman---woman%1:18:00:: met a famous author---author%1:18:00:: at a literary tea---tea%1:13:01:: .
`` It was only the other day---day%1:28:03:: that I saw something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine---magazine%1:10:00:: '' .
This baffling lack---lack%1:26:00:: of distinct details---detail%1:10:00:: recalls the secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: whose employer---employer%1:18:00:: was leaving the office---office%1:06:00:: and told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence---absence%1:04:00:: .
The girl---girl%1:18:00:: nodded understandingly .
`` Yes , sir---sir%1:18:00:: '' , she said , `` is that definite '' ?
An old-fashioned mother---mother%1:18:00:: said to her modern daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: , `` You must have gotten in quite late last night---night%1:28:00:: , dear .
The daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: replied , `` Oh , I had dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: with - well , you do n't know him but he 's awfully nice - and we went to a couple of places---place%1:15:01:: - I do n't suppose you 've heard of them - and we finished up at a cute little night club---nightclub%1:06:00:: - I forget the name---name%1:10:00:: of it .
Why , it 's all right , is n't it , Mother---mother%1:18:00:: '' ?
Her woolly minded parent---parent%1:18:00:: agreed .
`` Of course , dear---dear%1:18:00:: '' , she said .
No less ambiguous was the indefinity---indefinity%1:07:00:: of a certain clergyman---clergyman%1:18:00:: 's sermon---sermon%1:10:00:: .
`` Dearly beloved '' , he preached , `` unless you repent of your sins---sin%1:04:00:: in a measure , and become converted to a degree---degree%1:07:00:: , you will , I regret to say , be damned to a more or less extent---extent%1:07:00:: '' .
This clergyman---clergyman%1:18:00:: should have referred to Shakespeare---person%1:03:00:: 's dictum---dictum%1:10:00:: : `` So-so is a good , very good , very excellent maxim---maxim%1:10:00:: .
Indefinite reference---reference%1:10:02:: also carries double meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: where an allusion---allusion%1:10:00:: to one person---person%1:03:00:: or thing---thing%1:06:00:: seems to refer to another .
A news---news%1:10:01:: item---item%1:06:00:: described the launching---launching%1:04:02:: of a ship---ship%1:06:00:: : `` Completing the ceremony---ceremony%1:04:00:: , the beautiful movie star---movie_star%1:18:00:: smashed a bottle---bottle%1:23:00:: of champagne---champagne%1:13:00:: over her stern---stern%1:06:00:: as she slid gracefully down the ways---ways%1:06:00:: into the sea---sea%1:17:00:: '' .
This is not unlike the order---order%1:10:03:: received by the sergeant---sergeant%1:18:01:: of an army---army%1:14:00:: motor pool---motor_pool%1:14:00:: : `` Four trucks---truck%1:06:00:: to Fort Mason---location%1:03:00:: gym---gym%1:06:00:: , 7 : 30 tonight , for hauling girls---girl%1:18:00:: to dance---dance%1:14:00:: .
The bodies---body%1:17:00:: must be cleaned and seats---seat%1:06:00:: wiped off '' .
A politician---politician%1:18:01:: was approached by a man---man%1:18:00:: seeking the office---office%1:04:01:: of a minor public official---official%1:18:01:: who had just died .
`` What are my chances---chance%1:26:00:: for taking Joe---person%1:03:00:: 's place---place%1:26:01:: '' ? he asked .
`` If you can fix it up with the undertaker---undertaker%1:18:00:: '' , returned the politician---politician%1:18:01:: , `` it 's all right with me '' .
The manager---manager%1:18:00:: of a movie theater---movie_theater%1:06:00:: received a telephone call---telephone_call%1:10:00:: from a woman---woman%1:18:00:: who was equally indefinite .
`` What have you got on today---today%1:28:00:: '' ? she inquired .
`` A blue suit---suit%1:06:00:: '' , he answered .
There was a short pause---pause%1:28:00:: for reflection---reflection%1:09:00:: .
`` Oh '' , said the woman---woman%1:18:00:: , `` I 've seen that picture---picture%1:10:02:: already '' .
Another brand---brand%1:09:00:: of indefinite reference---reference%1:10:02:: arises out of the use---use%1:04:00:: of the double verb---verb%1:10:01:: .
When a question---question%1:10:00:: contains two verbs---verb%1:10:01:: , the response---response%1:10:01:: does not make clear which of them is being answered .
The moonlit night---night%1:28:00:: was made for romance---romance%1:26:00:: , and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time---time%1:28:00:: .
Finally he asked , `` Do you object to petting---petting%1:04:00:: '' ?
`` That 's one thing---thing%1:04:00:: I 've never done '' , she said promptly .
He thought a moment---moment%1:28:01:: , then inquired , `` You mean petted '' ?
Replies---reply%1:10:01:: to requests---request%1:10:00:: for character---character%1:10:01:: reference---reference%1:10:01:: are notorious for their evasive double-entendre---double_entendre%1:10:00:: .
Another less ambiguous case---case%1:11:00:: read as follows : `` The bearer---bearer%1:18:00:: of this letter---letter%1:10:00:: has served me for two years---year%1:28:01:: to his complete satisfaction---satisfaction%1:12:00:: .
If you are thinking of giving him a berth---berth%1:04:00:: , be sure to make it a wide one '' .
In the comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: of indefinite reference---reference%1:09:00:: , it wit---wit%1:10:00:: occupies a prominent place---place%1:09:00:: because of its frequent occurrence---occurrence%1:26:00:: .
Ambiguity---ambiguity%1:10:00:: arises when the pronoun---pronoun%1:10:00:: it carries a twofold reference---reference%1:09:00:: .
Two friends---friend%1:18:00:: were talking .
One said , `` When I get a cold---cold%1:26:00:: I buy a bottle---bottle%1:23:00:: of whiskey---whiskey%1:13:00:: for it , and within a few hours---hour%1:28:00:: it 's gone '' .
The speaker---speaker%1:18:00:: referred to the whiskey---whiskey%1:13:00:: but his friend---friend%1:18:00:: thought he meant the cold---cold%1:26:00:: .
It wit---wit%1:10:00:: is a misnomer---misnomer%1:10:00:: because it covers slips---slip%1:04:02:: as well as wit---wit%1:10:00:: .
An excited woman---woman%1:18:00:: was making an emergency---emergency%1:11:00:: call---call%1:10:01:: over the phone---phone%1:06:00:: : `` Doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , please come over right away .
My husband---husband%1:18:00:: is in great pain---pain%1:09:00:: .
That summer---summer%1:28:00:: the gambling houses---gambling_house%1:06:00:: were closed , despite the threats---threat%1:10:01:: of Pierre Ameaux---person%1:03:00:: , a gaming-card---gaming_card%1:06:00:: manufacturer---manufacturer%1:18:00:: .
Dancing---dancing%1:04:00:: was no longer permitted in the streets---street%1:06:00:: .
The Bordel---group%1:03:00:: and other places---place%1:15:00:: of prostitution---prostitution%1:04:00:: were emptied .
The slit---slit%1:08:00:: breeches---breeches%1:06:00:: had to go .
Drunkenness---drunkenness%1:26:00:: was no longer tolerated .
In defiance---defiance%1:10:00:: , a chinless reprobate---reprobate%1:18:00:: , Jake Camaret---person%1:03:00:: , marched down the aisle---aisle%1:06:00:: in St. Peter---group%1:03:00:: 's one Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: morning---morning%1:28:00:: , followed by one of the women---woman%1:18:00:: from the Bordel---group%1:03:00:: , whose dress---dress%1:06:01:: and walk---walk%1:07:00:: plainly showed the lack---lack%1:26:00:: of any shame---shame%1:26:00:: .
Plunking themselves down on the front bench---bench%1:06:00:: , they turned to smirk at those around them .
John---person%1:03:00:: 's first impulse---impulse%1:16:00:: was to denounce their blasphemy---blasphemy%1:10:00:: .
But the thought---thought%1:09:01:: occurred that God---god%1:18:00:: would want this opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: used to tell them about Him .
Calmly he opened the Bible---bible%1:10:00:: and read of the woman---woman%1:18:00:: at the well---well%1:06:00:: .
He finished the worship---worship%1:04:00:: service---service%1:04:01:: as if there had been no brazen attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to dishonor God---god%1:18:00:: and man .
The next morning---morning%1:28:00:: , as the clock---clock%1:06:00:: struck nine , he appeared at the Council---council%1:14:01:: meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: in the Town Hall---location%1:03:00:: and insisted that the couple---couple%1:23:00:: would have to be punished if the Church---church%1:14:00:: was to be respected .
`` I have told you before , and I tell you again '' , Monsieur Favre---person%1:03:00:: said rudely .
`` Stick to the preaching---preaching%1:10:00:: of the Gospel---gospel%1:10:00:: '' !
John---person%1:03:00:: stiffened in anger---anger%1:12:00:: .
`` That is the answer---answer%1:10:01:: the ungodly will always make when the Church---church%1:14:00:: points its fingers---finger%1:08:00:: at their sins---sin%1:04:00:: .
I say to you that the Church---church%1:14:00:: will ever decry evil---evil%1:04:00:: '' !
John---person%1:03:00:: 's reply---reply%1:10:01:: was like a declaration---declaration%1:10:00:: of war---war%1:04:00:: .
Monsieur Favre---person%1:03:00:: sat down in his high-backed stall---stall%1:06:00:: , lips---lip%1:08:00:: compressed , eyes---eye%1:08:00:: glinting .
Ablard Corne---person%1:03:00:: , a short man---man%1:18:00:: with a rotunda of stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: , rose .
Every eye---eye%1:08:00:: was on him as he began to speak .
`` What Master Calvin---person%1:03:00:: says is true .
How can we have a good city---city%1:15:00:: unless we respect morality---morality%1:16:00:: '' ?
Abel Poupin---person%1:03:00:: , a tall man---man%1:18:00:: with sunken cheeks---cheek%1:08:00:: and deep-set eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , got to his feet .
`` We all know that Jake Camaret---person%1:03:00:: and the woman---woman%1:18:00:: are brazenly living together .
It would be well to show the populace---populace%1:14:00:: how we deal with adulterers---adulterer%1:18:00:: '' .
Philibert Berthelier---person%1:03:00:: , the son---son%1:18:00:: of the famous patriot---patriot%1:18:00:: , disagreed .
`` Do not listen to that Frenchman---frenchman%1:18:00:: .
He is throttling the liberty---liberty%1:26:01:: my father---father%1:18:00:: gave his life---life%1:18:00:: to win '' !
John---person%1:03:00:: was quietly insistent .
`` There can be no compromise---compromise%1:10:00:: when souls---soul%1:03:00:: are in jeopardy---jeopardy%1:26:00:: '' .
A week---week%1:28:00:: later the sentence---sentence%1:28:00:: of the Council---council%1:14:01:: was carried out : Jake Camaret---person%1:03:00:: and the woman---woman%1:18:00:: were marched naked through the streets---street%1:06:00:: past a mocking populace---populace%1:14:00:: .
Before them stalked the beadle---beadle%1:18:00:: , proclaiming as he went , `` Thus the Council---council%1:14:01:: deals with those who break its laws---law%1:14:00:: - adulterers---adulterer%1:18:00:: , thieves---thief%1:18:00:: , murderers---murderer%1:18:00:: , and lewd persons---person%1:03:00:: .
Let evildoers---evildoer%1:18:00:: contemplate their ways---way%1:04:00:: , and let every man---man%1:18:00:: beware '' !
John---person%1:03:00:: 's thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: raced painfully into the past---past%1:28:00:: as he read the letter---letter%1:10:00:: he had just received from his sister---sister%1:18:00:: Mary---person%1:03:00:: .
Charles---person%1:03:00:: had died two weeks---two_weeks%1:28:00:: before , in early November---november%1:28:00:: , without being reconciled to the Church---church%1:14:00:: .
The canons---canon%1:10:00:: , in a body---body%1:14:00:: , had tried to force him on his deathbed---deathbed%1:28:00:: to let them give him the last rites---last_rites%1:04:01:: of the Church---church%1:14:00:: , but he had died still proclaiming salvation---salvation%1:04:00:: by faith---faith%1:09:00:: .
Burial---burial%1:11:00:: had taken place at night---night%1:28:00:: in the ground---ground%1:27:00:: at the public crossroads---crossroads%1:26:00:: under the gibbet---gibbet%1:06:00:: , so that his enemies---enemy%1:18:00:: could not find his body---body%1:08:00:: and have it dug up and burned .
The Abbot---abbot%1:18:00:: of St. Eloi---group%1:03:00:: , Claude de Mommor---person%1:03:00:: , had been a good friend---friend%1:18:00:: , but not even he thought Charles---person%1:03:00:: deserved burial---burial%1:11:00:: in hallowed ground---ground%1:27:00:: .
John---person%1:03:00:: closed his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and saw once again the little niche---niche%1:25:00:: in his mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: , where she had knelt to tell the good Virgin---person%1:03:00:: of her needs---need%1:03:00:: .
The blue draped Virgin---person%1:03:00:: was still there , but no one knelt before her now .
Not even Varnessa---person%1:03:00:: ; she , too , prayed only to God---god%1:18:00:: .
For an instant---instant%1:28:01:: John---person%1:03:00:: longed for the sound---sound%1:09:00:: of the bells---bell%1:06:00:: of Noyon-la-Sainte---location%1:03:00:: , the touch---touch%1:11:00:: of his mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's hand---hand%1:08:00:: , the lilt---lilt%1:07:00:: of Charles---person%1:03:00:: 's voice---voice%1:10:00:: in the square raftered rooms---room%1:06:00:: , his father---father%1:18:00:: 's bass---bass%1:10:01:: tones---tone%1:10:02:: rumbling to the canons---canon%1:10:00:: , and the sight---sight%1:09:01:: of the beloved bishop---bishop%1:18:00:: .
But he had to follow the light---light%1:09:00:: .
Unless God---god%1:18:00:: expected a man---man%1:18:00:: to believe the Holy Scriptures---holy_scripture%1:10:00:: , why had He given them to him ?
The white clad trees---tree%1:20:00:: stood like specters---specter%1:09:00:: in the February---february%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: .
Snow---snow%1:19:00:: buried the streets---street%1:06:00:: and covered the slanting rooftops---rooftop%1:15:00:: , as John---person%1:03:00:: trudged toward St. Peter---group%1:03:00:: 's .
A carriage---carriage%1:06:01:: crunched by , its dim lights---light%1:06:00:: filtering through the gloom---gloom%1:26:01:: .
The sharp wind---wind%1:19:00:: slapped at him and his feet---foot%1:08:01:: felt like ice---ice%1:27:00:: as the snow---snow%1:19:00:: penetrated the holes---hole%1:17:01:: of his shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: , his only ones , now patched with folded parchment---parchment%1:27:01:: .
The city---city%1:15:01:: had recently given him a small salary---salary%1:21:00:: , but it was not enough to supply even necessities---necessity%1:26:00:: .
As he neared the square---square%1:15:00:: , a round figure---figure%1:08:00:: muffled in a long , black cape---cape%1:06:00:: whisked by .
John---person%1:03:00:: recognized Ablard Corne---person%1:03:00:: and called out a greeting---greeting%1:10:00:: .
How grateful he was to such men---man%1:18:00:: !
There were several on the Council---council%1:14:01:: who tried to live like Christians---christian%1:18:00:: .
Despite their efforts---effort%1:04:00:: , the problems---problem%1:26:00:: seemed to grow graver all the time .
Quickening his steps---step%1:23:00:: , John---person%1:03:00:: entered the vast church---church%1:06:00:: and climbed the tower---tower%1:06:00:: steps---steps%1:06:00:: to the bells---bell%1:06:00:: .
Underneath the big one , in the silent moonlight---moonlight%1:19:00:: , lay a dead pigeon---pigeon%1:05:00:: , and on the smaller bell---bell%1:06:00:: , the Clemence , two gray and white birds---bird%1:05:00:: slept huddled together in the cold winter---winter%1:28:00:: air---air%1:27:00:: .
John---person%1:03:00:: leaned upon the stone---stone%1:06:00:: balustrade---balustrade%1:06:00:: .
He brushed back his black hair---hair%1:08:00:: , shoving it under his pastor---pastor%1:18:00:: 's cap---cap%1:06:00:: to keep it from blowing in his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
Below the moon splashed world---world%1:17:01:: rolled away to insurmountable white peaks---peak%1:15:00:: ; above him the deep blue sky---sky%1:17:00:: glittered with stars---star%1:17:00:: .
He stood very still , his arms---arm%1:08:00:: at his sides---side%1:08:00:: , staring up at the heavens---heavens%1:15:00:: , then down at the blinking lights---light%1:06:00:: below .
`` How long , my Lord---lord%1:18:01:: ?
I have never asked for an easy task---task%1:04:00:: , but I am weary of the strife---strife%1:26:00:: '' .
Sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: was difficult these days---day%1:28:03:: .
Indigestion---indigestion%1:26:00:: plagued him .
Severe headaches---headache%1:26:00:: were frequent .
Loneliness---loneliness%1:26:00:: tore through him like a physical pain---pain%1:12:00:: whenever he thought of Peter Robert---person%1:03:00:: , Nerien---person%1:03:00:: , Nicholas Cop---person%1:03:00:: , Martin Bucer---person%1:03:00:: , and even the compromising Louis du Tillet---person%1:03:00:: .
An occasional traveler---traveler%1:18:00:: from Italy---italy%1:15:00:: brought news---news%1:10:01:: of Peter Robert---person%1:03:00:: , who was now distributing his Bible---bible%1:10:00:: among the Waldensian---location%1:03:00:: peasants---peasant%1:18:00:: .
Letters---letter%1:10:00:: came regularly from Nerien---person%1:03:00:: , Nicholas---person%1:03:00:: , and Martin---person%1:03:00:: .
He had Anthony---person%1:03:00:: and William---person%1:03:00:: to confide in and consult .
But William---person%1:03:00:: continued to find a bitter joy---joy%1:12:00:: in smashing images---image%1:06:00:: and tearing down symbols---symbol%1:10:00:: sacred to the Old Church---group%1:03:00:: .
John---person%1:03:00:: found it difficult , but he held him in check---check%1:26:00:: .
And Anthony---person%1:03:00:: was busy most of the time---time%1:28:05:: courting this girl---girl%1:18:01:: and that .
His easy good looks---good_looks%1:07:00:: made him a favorite---favorite%1:18:00:: with the ladies---lady%1:18:02:: .
Geneva---location%1:03:00:: , instead of becoming the City of God , as John---person%1:03:00:: had dreamed , had in the two years---year%1:28:01:: since he had been there , continued to be a godless place---place%1:15:01:: where all manner---manner%1:09:01:: of vice---vice%1:07:00:: flourished .
Refugees---refugee%1:18:00:: poured in , signing the Confession---confession%1:10:00:: and rules---rule%1:09:01:: in order to remain , and then disregarding them .
Dice---dice%1:06:00:: rolled , prostitutes---prostitute%1:18:00:: plied their trade---trade%1:04:00:: , thieves---thief%1:18:00:: stole , murderers---murderer%1:18:00:: stabbed , and the ungodly blasphemed .
Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: who were truly Christians---christian%1:18:00:: longed for the simple penance---penance%1:04:01:: of days---day%1:28:03:: gone by .
Libertines---libertine%1:18:00:: recalled the heroism---heroism%1:07:00:: of the past---past%1:28:00:: and demanded : `` Are we going to allow the Protestant Pope , Master Calvin---person%1:03:00:: , to curtail our liberty---liberty%1:26:01:: ?
Why , oh why , does n't he stick to preaching---preaching%1:10:00:: the Gospel---gospel%1:10:00:: , instead of meddling in civic affairs---affair%1:09:00:: , politics---politics%1:09:00:: , economics---economics%1:09:00:: , and social issues---issue%1:09:01:: that are no concern---concern%1:09:00:: of the Church---church%1:14:00:: '' ?
Why , oh why , does n't he stick to preaching the Gospel , instead of meddling in civic affairs , politics , economics , and social issues---issue%1:09:00:: that are no concern of the Church '' ?
And John---person%1:03:00:: 's reply---reply%1:10:01:: was always the same : `` Anything that affects souls---soul%1:03:00:: is the concern---concern%1:09:00:: of the Church---church%1:14:00:: !
We will have righteousness---righteousness%1:07:00:: '' !
Tears---tears%1:04:00:: burned behind his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: as he prayed and meditated tonight .
Unless the confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: cleared , he would not be coming here much longer .
Monsieur Favre---person%1:03:00:: 's threat---threat%1:10:01:: would become a reality---reality%1:26:01:: , for he continued to proclaim loudly that the city---city%1:15:00:: must rid itself of `` that Frenchman---frenchman%1:18:00:: '' .
The slow tapping---tapping%1:11:00:: of a cane---cane%1:06:01:: on the stone---stone%1:06:00:: steps---steps%1:06:00:: coming up to the tower---tower%1:06:00:: interrupted his reverie---reverie%1:09:01:: .
Faint at first , the tapping---tapping%1:11:00:: grew until it sounded loud against the wind---wind%1:19:00:: .
Eli Corault---person%1:03:00:: !
John---person%1:03:00:: thought .
What is he doing here at this hour---hour%1:28:01:: ?
He started down the steps---steps%1:06:00:: to meet the near-blind preacher---preacher%1:18:00:: , who had been one of the early Gospelers---gospeler%1:18:00:: in Paris---location%1:03:00:: .
`` John---person%1:03:00:: ?
I came to warn you of a plot---plot%1:09:00:: '' !
John---person%1:03:00:: stood above him , his face---face%1:08:00:: ashen .
Slowly , like a man---man%1:18:00:: grown old , he took Eli---person%1:03:00:: 's hand---hand%1:08:00:: and led him below to the tower---tower%1:06:00:: study---study%1:06:00:: , guiding him to a chair---chair%1:06:00:: beside the little hearth---hearth%1:06:01:: where a fire---fire%1:27:01:: still burned .
`` Plot---plot%1:09:00:: '' ?
John---person%1:03:00:: asked tiredly .
`` Monsieur Favre---person%1:03:00:: just paid me a visit---visit%1:14:00:: .
I went to your rooms---room%1:06:00:: , and Anthony---person%1:03:00:: told me you were here .
Two Anabaptists---anabaptist%1:18:00:: , Caroli---person%1:03:00:: and Benoit---person%1:03:00:: , are to challenge you and William---person%1:03:00:: to a debate---debate%1:10:00:: before the Council---council%1:14:01:: .
It is to be a trap---trap%1:06:00:: .
You know the law---law%1:14:00:: : if you lose the debate---debate%1:10:00:: after accepting a challenge---challenge%1:10:00:: , you will be banished '' !
`` What will be the subject---subject%1:10:00:: '' ?
`` You are to be accused of Arianism---arianism%1:09:00:: to confuse the religious who remain loyal '' .
Anger---anger%1:12:00:: and fear---fear%1:12:00:: fused in John---person%1:03:00:: .
Ever since the fourth century---century%1:28:00:: a controversy---controversy%1:10:00:: had raged over the person---person%1:03:00:: of Christ---christ%1:18:00:: .
Those who refused to believe that He was the eternal Son---son%1:18:01:: of God---god%1:18:00:: were termed Arianists---arianist%1:18:00:: .
Peter Caroli---person%1:03:00:: had come to Geneva---location%1:03:00:: , saying that he had been a bishop---bishop%1:18:00:: of the Church of Rome---church_of_rome%1:14:00:: and had been persecuted in Paris---paris%1:15:00:: for his Reformed faith---faith%1:09:00:: .
He asked to be appointed a preacher---preacher%1:18:00:: .
But Michael Sept---person%1:03:00:: had unmasked him , revealing he had never been a bishop---bishop%1:18:00:: , but was an Anabaptist---anabaptist%1:18:00:: , afraid to state his faith---faith%1:09:00:: , because he knew John Calvin---person%1:03:00:: had written a book---book%1:10:00:: against their belief that the soul---soul%1:18:00:: slept after death---death%1:28:00:: .
So John---person%1:03:00:: had refused to agree to his appointment---appointment%1:04:00:: as a preacher---preacher%1:18:00:: , and now Caroli---person%1:03:00:: sought revenge---revenge%1:04:00:: .
John---person%1:03:00:: sighed .
`` If William---person%1:03:00:: agrees , we should insist on a public debate---public_debate%1:10:00:: '' , he said at length .
`` There is more to the conspiracy---conspiracy%1:09:00:: .
Bern---person%1:03:00:: demands that the Lord's Supper---lord's_supper%1:04:00:: be administered here as it used to be , with unleavened bread---unleavened_bread%1:13:00:: .
Furthermore , Bern---bern%1:15:00:: decrees that we must do as we are ordered by the Council---council%1:14:01:: , preach only the word of God---word_of_god%1:10:00:: and stop meddling in politics---politics%1:09:00:: '' !
`` It was always the spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: with Christ---christ%1:18:00:: ; matters---matter%1:09:00:: such as leavened or unleavened bread---unleavened_bread%1:13:00:: are inconsequential .
Geneva---location%1:03:00:: must remain a sovereign state---state%1:14:01:: .
We will not yield to the demands---demand%1:10:00:: of Bern---bern%1:15:00:: '' !
The firelight---firelight%1:19:00:: played over Eli---person%1:03:00:: 's flowing white locks---lock%1:08:00:: and rugged features---feature%1:08:00:: .
`` Monsieur Favre---person%1:03:00:: indicated that if I would co-operate , after you and William---person%1:03:00:: are banished , following the debate---debate%1:10:00:: , I will be given a place---place%1:04:00:: of influence---influence%1:07:00:: '' .
`` What was your reply---reply%1:10:01:: to that '' ?
`` That I would rather be banished with two such Christians---christian%1:18:00:: than be made the Chief Syndic---person%1:03:00:: '' !
The following morning---morning%1:28:00:: , as John---person%1:03:00:: entered the Place Molard---location%1:03:00:: on his way---way%1:04:02:: to visit---visit%1:14:00:: a sick refugee---refugee%1:18:00:: , he had a premonition---premonition%1:12:00:: of danger---danger%1:26:00:: .
Then suddenly a group---group%1:03:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: and dogs---dog%1:05:00:: circled him .
He stood very still , his heart---heart%1:08:00:: thumping wildly .
On the outskirts---outskirts%1:15:00:: of the rabble---rabble%1:14:00:: the Camaret---person%1:03:00:: brothers---brother%1:18:00:: and Gaspard Favre---person%1:03:00:: shook their fists---fist%1:08:00:: .
`` Are you going to comply with the demands---demand%1:10:00:: of Bern---bern%1:15:00:: '' ?
the chinless Jake---person%1:03:00:: called .
`` Arianist---arianist%1:18:00:: '' ! a rowdy---rowdy%1:18:00:: with a big blob---blob%1:25:00:: of a nose---nose%1:08:00:: roared .
`` Heretic---heretic%1:18:00:: '' !
John---person%1:03:00:: lifted his hand---hand%1:08:00:: for silence---silence%1:07:00:: .
`` Know this : the ministers---minister%1:18:00:: will not yield to the demands---demand%1:10:00:: of Bern---bern%1:15:00:: '' .
His voice---voice%1:10:00:: shook a little .
Somebody heaved a stone---stone%1:17:00:: .
For an instant---instant%1:28:01:: John---person%1:03:00:: was stunned .
When he felt the side---side%1:15:02:: of his head---head%1:08:00:: , his fingers---finger%1:08:00:: came away covered with blood---blood%1:08:00:: .
Before he could duck , another stone---stone%1:17:00:: struck him .
Pierre Ameaux---person%1:03:00:: , the gaming-card---gaming_card%1:06:00:: manufacturer---manufacturer%1:18:00:: said , his little pig---pig%1:05:00:: eyes---eye%1:08:00:: glaring .
`` We have taught him a lesson---lesson%1:10:00:: '' .
The crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: moved back and John---person%1:03:00:: started dizzily down the hill---hill%1:17:00:: .
Fists---fist%1:08:00:: pummeled him as he staggered forward .
Then he slipped and went down on his hands---hand%1:08:00:: and knees---knee%1:08:00:: in the melting snow---snow%1:19:00:: .
At once a bevy---bevy%1:14:01:: of dogs---dog%1:05:00:: was snapping and snarling around him .
One , more horrible than the rest---rest%1:24:00:: , lunged , growling deep in his throat---throat%1:08:00:: , his hair---hair%1:08:00:: bristling .
With great difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: John---person%1:03:00:: clambered to his feet---foot%1:08:01:: and started to run , sweat pouring down his face---face%1:08:00:: .
Some who have written on Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: have treated it as `` a learned diversion---diversion%1:04:00:: of a learned world---world%1:14:01:: '' , `` a phantasy---phantasy%1:09:01:: with which More---person%1:03:00:: amused himself '' , `` a holiday---holiday%1:28:00:: work---work%1:06:00:: , a spontaneous overflow---overflow%1:04:00:: of intellectual high spirits---high_spirits%1:12:00:: , a revel---revel%1:04:00:: of debate---debate%1:10:01:: , paradox---paradox%1:10:00:: , comedy---comedy%1:10:01:: and invention---invention%1:04:00:: '' .
With respect to this view---view%1:09:02:: , two points---point%1:09:02:: are worth making .
First , it appears to be based on the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that on its title page---title_page%1:10:00:: Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: is described as `` festivus '' , `` gay '' .
It overlooks the other fact---fact%1:09:01:: that it is described as `` Nec minus salutaris quam festivus '' , `` no less salutary than gay '' .
It also overlooks the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that in a rational lexicon---lexicon%1:09:00:: , and quite clearly in More---person%1:03:00:: 's lexicon---lexicon%1:09:00:: , the opposite---opposite%1:10:00:: of serious is not gay but frivolous , and the opposite---opposite%1:10:00:: of gay is not serious but solemn .
More---person%1:03:00:: believed that a man---man%1:18:00:: could be both serious and gay .
That a writer---writer%1:18:01:: who is gay cannot be serious is a common professional illusion---illusion%1:09:00:: , sedulously fostered by all too many academics---academic%1:18:00:: who mistakenly believe that their frivolous efforts---effort%1:04:00:: should be taken seriously because they are expressed with that dreary solemnity---solemnity%1:07:00:: which is the only mode---mode%1:07:00:: of expression---expression%1:10:04:: their authors---author%1:18:00:: are capable of .
Secondly , to find a learned diversion---diversion%1:04:00:: and a pleasing joke---joke%1:10:00:: in More---person%1:03:00:: 's account---account%1:10:00:: of the stupid brutalities---brutality%1:04:00:: of early sixteenth century---century%1:28:00:: wars---war%1:26:00:: , of the anguish---anguish%1:26:00:: of the poor and dispossessed , of the insolence---insolence%1:07:00:: and cruelty---cruelty%1:04:00:: of the rich and powerful requires a callousness---callousness%1:07:00:: toward suffering---suffering%1:26:01:: and sin---sin%1:04:00:: that would be surprising in a moral imbecile---imbecile%1:18:00:: and most surprising in More---person%1:03:00:: himself .
Indeed , it is even surprising in the Canon---canon%1:10:00:: of Christ Church---group%1:03:00:: and Regius Professor---regius_professor%1:18:00:: of Ecclesiastical History---history%1:09:00:: , who fathered this most peculiar view---view%1:09:02:: , and in the brilliant Professor---professor%1:18:00:: of Medieval and Renaissance English at Cambridge---cambridge%1:06:00:: , who inherited it and is now its most eminent proponent---proponent%1:18:00:: .
But to return to the main line---line%1:09:01:: of our inquiry---inquiry%1:09:01:: .
It is doubtful that Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: is still widely read because More---person%1:03:00:: was medieval or even because he was a martyr---martyr%1:18:00:: - indeed , it is likely that these days---day%1:28:03:: many who read Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: with interest---interest%1:09:00:: do not even know that its author---author%1:18:00:: was a martyr---martyr%1:18:00:: .
Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: is still widely read because in a sense More---person%1:03:00:: stood on the margin---margin%1:25:00:: of modernity---modernity%1:07:00:: .
And if he did stand on the margins---margin%1:25:00:: of modernity---modernity%1:07:00:: , it was not in dying a martyr---martyr%1:18:00:: for such unity---unity%1:26:00:: as Papal supremacy---supremacy%1:26:00:: might be able to force on Western Christendom---christendom%1:14:00:: .
It was not even in writing---writing%1:04:02:: Latin---latin%1:10:00:: epigrams---epigram%1:10:00:: , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian---person%1:03:00:: from Greek---greek%1:10:00:: into Latin---latin%1:10:00:: or in defending the study---study%1:04:00:: of Greek---greek%1:10:00:: against the attack---attack%1:10:00:: of conservative academics---academic%1:18:00:: , or in attacking the conservative theologians---theologian%1:18:00:: who opposed Erasmus---person%1:03:00:: 's philological study---study%1:09:04:: of the New Testament---new_testament%1:10:00:: .
It was not even in writing Latin epigrams , sometimes bawdy ones , or in translating Lucian from Greek into Latin or in defending the study of Greek against the attack of conservative academics , or in attacking the conservative theologians who opposed Erasmus 's philological study---study%1:04:00:: of the New Testament .
Similar literary exercises---exercise%1:04:01:: were the common doings of a Christian humanist---humanist%1:18:00:: of the first two decades---decade%1:28:00:: of the sixteenth century---century%1:28:00:: .
Had More---person%1:03:00:: 's writings---writing%1:10:02:: been wholly limited to such exercises---exercise%1:04:01:: , they would be almost as dimly remembered as those of a dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: or so other authors---author%1:18:00:: living in his time---time%1:28:00:: , whose works---works%1:06:02:: tenuously survive in the minds---mind%1:09:00:: of the few hundred scholars---scholar%1:18:00:: who each decade---decade%1:28:00:: in pursuit---pursuit%1:09:00:: of their very specialized occasions---occasions%1:09:00:: read those works---work%1:06:00:: .
More---person%1:03:00:: stands on the margins---margin%1:25:00:: of modernity---modernity%1:07:00:: for one reason---reason%1:10:01:: alone - because he wrote Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: .
And the evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that he does , indeed , stand there derives quite simply from the vigorous interest---interest%1:09:00:: with which rather casual readers---reader%1:18:02:: have responded to that book---book%1:10:00:: for the past century---century%1:28:00:: or so .
Only one---one%1:23:00:: other contemporary---contemporary%1:18:00:: of More---person%1:03:00:: 's evokes so immediate and direct a response---response%1:10:02:: , and only one other contemporary work---work%1:06:00:: - Niccolo Machiavelli---person%1:03:00:: and The Prince .
Can we discover what it is in Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: that has evoked this response---response%1:10:02:: ?
Remember that in seeking the modern in Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: we do not deny the existence---existence%1:26:00:: of the medieval and the Renaissance---renaissance%1:28:00:: there ; we do not even need to commit ourselves to assessing on the same inconceivable scale---scale%1:24:03:: the relative importance---importance%1:07:00:: of the medieval , the Renaissance---renaissance%1:28:00:: , and the modern .
The medieval was the most important to Chambers---person%1:03:00:: because he sought to place Thomas More---person%1:03:00:: , the author---author%1:18:00:: of Utopia , in some intelligible relation---relation%1:03:00:: with St. Thomas More---person%1:03:00:: , the martyr---martyr%1:18:00:: .
To others whose concern---concern%1:09:00:: it is to penetrate the significance---significance%1:10:00:: of Christian Humanism , the Renaissance---renaissance%1:28:00:: elements---element%1:09:00:: are of primary concern---concern%1:09:00:: .
But here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation---preoccupation%1:09:00:: ; we want to know why that book---book%1:10:00:: has kept on selling the way---way%1:07:01:: it has ; we want to know what is perennially new about Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: .
To that question---question%1:10:00:: the answer---answer%1:10:01:: is simple ; it can be made in two words---word%1:10:00:: , Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: .
But it is an answer---answer%1:10:01:: which opens the door---door%1:06:00:: wide to an onrush---onrush%1:04:00:: of objections---objection%1:10:00:: and denials---denial%1:10:00:: .
Surely there is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: new about communism---communism%1:14:00:: .
We find it in Plato---plato%1:18:00:: 's republic---republic%1:14:00:: , and in Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: More---person%1:03:00:: acknowledges his debt---debt%1:26:00:: to that book---book%1:10:00:: .
We find it in that `` common way of life---way_of_life%1:04:00:: pleasing to Christ---christ%1:18:00:: and still in use among the truest societies---society%1:14:00:: of Christians---christian%1:18:00:: '' , that is , the better monasteries---monastery%1:06:00:: which made it easier to convert the Utopians---utopian%1:18:00:: to Christianity---christianity%1:09:00:: .
We find it in the later Stoic conception---conception%1:09:00:: of man 's natural condition---condition%1:26:00:: which included the community---community%1:21:00:: of all possessions---possession%1:03:00:: .
This conception---conception%1:09:00:: was taken up by the early Church Fathers---church_father%1:18:00:: and by canon---canon%1:10:00:: lawyers---lawyer%1:18:00:: and theologians---theologian%1:18:00:: in the Middle Ages---middle_ages%1:28:00:: ; and More---person%1:03:00:: was far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the forms---form%1:09:00:: thus given it .
But although the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of communism---communism%1:14:00:: is very old even in More---person%1:03:00:: 's day---day%1:28:03:: and did not spring full-clad from his imagination---imagination%1:09:02:: in 1515 , it is not communism---communism%1:14:00:: as such that we are concerned with .
We are concerned not with the genus---genus%1:09:00:: communism---communism%1:14:00:: nor with other species---species%1:09:00:: of the genus---genus%1:09:00:: :
Platonic , Stoic , early Christian , monastic , canonist or theological communism---communism%1:14:00:: ; we are concerned with Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: - that is , simply communism---communism%1:14:00:: as it appears in the imaginary commonwealth---commonwealth%1:14:00:: of Utopia , as More---person%1:03:00:: conceived it .
Perhaps one way---way%1:04:01:: to sharpen our sense---sense%1:09:05:: of the modernity---modernity%1:07:00:: of Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: is to contrast it with the principal earlier types---type%1:09:00:: of communistic theory---theory%1:09:00:: .
We will achieve a more vivid sense---sense%1:09:05:: of what it is by realizing what it is not .
In Plato---plato%1:18:00:: 's Republic communism---communism%1:14:00:: is - to speak anachronistically - a communism---communism%1:14:00:: of Janissaries---janissary%1:18:01:: .
Its function---function%1:04:00:: is to separate from the base ruled mass---mass%1:14:01:: , among whom private ownership---ownership%1:21:00:: prevails , the governing warrior---warrior%1:18:00:: elite---elite%1:14:00:: .
Moreover , it is too readily forgotten that in the Republic what gave the initial impetus---impetus%1:19:00:: to Plato---plato%1:18:00:: 's excursus---excursus%1:10:00:: into the construction---construction%1:09:00:: of an imaginary commonwealth---commonwealth%1:14:00:: with its ruling-class---ruling_class%1:14:00:: communism---communism%1:14:00:: of goods , wives---wife%1:18:00:: , and children---child%1:18:01:: , was his quest---quest%1:09:00:: for a canon---canon%1:10:00:: for the proper ordering---ordering%1:04:00:: of the individual human psyche---psyche%1:09:00:: ; and it is to this problem---problem%1:10:00:: that the Republic ultimately returns .
In More---person%1:03:00:: 's Utopia communism---communism%1:14:00:: is not a means---means%1:04:00:: of separating out a warrior---warrior%1:18:00:: elite---elite%1:14:00:: from the lumpish mass---mass%1:14:01:: .
Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: applies to all Utopians---utopian%1:18:00:: .
And in the economy---economy%1:14:00:: of the book---book%1:10:00:: it is not peripheral but central .
The concern---concern%1:09:00:: of Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: is with the optimo reipublicae statu , the best ordering---ordering%1:04:00:: of a civil society---society%1:14:00:: ; and it is again and again made clear that Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: provides the institutional array---array%1:14:00:: indispensable to that best ordering---ordering%1:04:00:: .
To derive Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: from the Jerusalem---jerusalem%1:15:00:: Christian community of the apostolic age---age%1:28:02:: or from its medieval successors---successor%1:18:01:: in spirit---spirit%1:10:00:: , the monastic communities , is with an appropriate shift---shift%1:04:01:: of adjectives---adjective%1:10:00:: , misleading in the same way---way%1:07:01:: as to derive it from Plato---plato%1:18:00:: 's Republic :
in the Republic we have to do with an elite---elite%1:14:00:: of physical and intellectual athletes---athlete%1:18:00:: , in the apostolic and monastic communities with an elite---elite%1:14:00:: of spiritual and religious athletes---athlete%1:18:00:: .
The apostolic community was literally an elite---elite%1:14:00:: : chosen by Christ---christ%1:18:00:: himself .
And the monastic communities were supposed to be made up of volunteers---volunteer%1:18:00:: selected only after a novitiate---novitiate%1:28:00:: which would test their religious aptitude---aptitude%1:09:00:: for monastic rigors---rigor%1:07:00:: , their spiritual athleticism---athleticism%1:07:00:: .
Finally , the conception---conception%1:09:00:: of the natural community---community%1:21:00:: of all possessions---possession%1:03:00:: which originated with the Stoics---stoic%1:18:01:: was firmly fixed in a tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: by More---person%1:03:00:: 's time---time%1:28:00:: , although it was not accepted by all the theologian---theologian%1:18:00:: philosophers---philosopher%1:18:00:: of the Middle Ages---middle_ages%1:28:00:: .
In that tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: communism---communism%1:14:00:: lay a safe distance---distance%1:07:00:: back in the age---age%1:28:02:: of innocence---innocence%1:07:01:: before the Fall---fall%1:11:03:: of Man .
It did not serve to contrast the existing order---order%1:26:00:: of society---society%1:14:00:: with a possible alternative order---order%1:26:00:: , because the age---age%1:28:02:: of innocence---innocence%1:07:01:: was not a possible alternative---alternative%1:09:00:: once man had sinned .
The actual function---function%1:07:00:: of patristic civilian canonist scholastic communism---communism%1:14:00:: was adequately set forth by St. Gregory---person%1:03:00:: almost a millennium---millennium%1:28:00:: before More---person%1:03:00:: wrote Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: .
`` The soil---soil%1:27:01:: is common to all men .
When we give the necessities---necessity%1:17:00:: of life---life%1:26:00:: to the poor , we restore to them what is already theirs .
We should think of it more as an act---act%1:03:00:: of justice---justice%1:07:00:: than compassion---compassion%1:07:00:: '' .
Because community---community%1:21:00:: not severalty---severalty%1:26:00:: of property---property%1:21:00:: is the law of nature---law_of_nature%1:09:00:: no man---man%1:18:00:: can assert an absolutely unalterable right---right%1:07:00:: to what is his .
Indeed , of all that is his every man---man%1:18:00:: is by nature---nature%1:07:02:: and reason---reason%1:09:00:: and therefore by conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: obligated to regard himself as a custodian---custodian%1:18:00:: .
He is a trustee---trustee%1:18:00:: for the common good---good%1:07:01:: , however feeble the safeguards---safeguard%1:04:00:: which the positive or municipal law---law%1:14:00:: of property---property%1:21:00:: provides against his misuse---misuse%1:04:00:: of that share---share%1:21:00:: of the common fund---fund%1:21:00:: , wisely or unwisely , entrusted to his keeping---keeping%1:04:00:: .
In contrast to this Stoic patristic view---view%1:09:02:: , Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: implies that the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of man is such that to rely on individual conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: to supply the deficiencies---deficiency%1:07:00:: of municipal law---law%1:14:00:: is to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness---sinfulness%1:07:00:: in a sieve---sieve%1:06:00:: .
The Utopians---utopian%1:18:00:: brace conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: with legal sanctions---sanction%1:04:02:: .
In a properly ordered society---society%1:14:00:: the massive force---force%1:07:00:: of public law---public_law%1:10:00:: performs the function---function%1:04:00:: which in natural law---natural_law%1:09:00:: theory---theory%1:09:00:: ineptly is left altogether to a small voice---small_voice%1:16:00:: so often still .
In all the respects---respect%1:09:00:: just indicated Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: differs from previous conceptions---conception%1:09:00:: in which community---community%1:21:00:: of possessions---possession%1:03:00:: and living---living%1:09:00:: plays a role---role%1:04:00:: .
Neither from one of these conceptions---conception%1:09:00:: nor from a combination---combination%1:14:00:: of them can it be deduced .
We do not deny originality---originality%1:09:00:: to the Agamemnon because Aeschylus---aeschylus%1:18:00:: found the tales---tale%1:10:00:: of the house---house%1:14:00:: of Atreus---person%1:03:00:: among the folk lore---folklore%1:09:00:: of the Greeks---greek%1:18:00:: .
In a like sense whatever bits---bit%1:17:00:: or shreds---shred%1:23:00:: of previous conceptions---conception%1:09:00:: one may find in it , Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: remains , as an integral whole---whole%1:09:00:: , original - a new thing---thing%1:26:00:: .
It is not merely a new thing---thing%1:26:00:: ; it is one of the very few new things---thing%1:26:00:: in Utopia ; most of the rest---rest%1:24:00:: is medieval or humanist or part---part%1:24:00:: of an old tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: of social criticism---criticism%1:10:01:: .
But to say that at a moment---moment%1:28:01:: in history---history%1:28:00:: something is new is not necessarily to say that it is modern ; and for this statement---statement%1:10:00:: the best evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: comes within the five years---year%1:28:01:: following the publication---publication%1:04:01:: of Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: , when Martin Luther---person%1:03:00:: elaborates a new perception---perception%1:09:02:: of the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of the Divine---divine%1:18:01:: 's encounter---encounter%1:04:01:: with man .
New , indeed , is Luther---person%1:03:00:: 's perception---perception%1:09:02:: , but not modern , as anyone knows who has ever tried to make intelligible to modern students---student%1:18:00:: what Luther---person%1:03:00:: was getting at .
Although Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: is both new in 1516 and also modern , it is not modern communism---communism%1:14:00:: or even modern socialism---socialism%1:09:00:: , as they exist or have ever existed in theory or in practice .
Consider the features---feature%1:09:00:: of Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: :
generous public provision---provision%1:04:01:: for the infirm ; democratic and secret elections---election%1:04:01:: of all officers---officer%1:18:02:: including priests---priest%1:18:00:: , meals---meal%1:13:00:: taken publicly in common refectories---refectory%1:06:00:: ; a common habit---habit%1:06:00:: or uniform---uniform%1:06:00:: prescribed for all citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: ; even houses---house%1:06:00:: changed once a decade---decade%1:28:00:: ; six hours---hour%1:28:00:: of manual labor---manual_labor%1:04:00:: a day---day%1:28:00:: for all but a handful---handful%1:23:00:: of magistrates---magistrate%1:18:00:: and scholars---scholar%1:18:00:: , and careful measures---measure%1:04:01:: to prevent anyone from shirking ; no private property---private_property%1:21:00:: , no money---money%1:21:00:: ; no sort---sort%1:09:00:: of pricing at all for any goods or services---service%1:04:08:: , and therefore no market---market%1:04:00:: in the economic sense of the term---term%1:10:00:: .
Whatever the merits---merit%1:07:01:: of its intent---intent%1:09:00:: , Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: is far too naive , far too crude , to suit any modern socialist---socialist%1:18:00:: or communist---communist%1:18:00:: .
It is not the details---detail%1:09:00:: of Utopian communism---communism%1:14:00:: that make Utopia---utopia%1:10:00:: modern , it is the spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: , the attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of mind---mind%1:09:00:: that informs those details---detail%1:09:00:: .
What that spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: and attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: were we can best understand if we see more precisely how it contrasts with the communist---communist%1:18:00:: tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: with the longest continuous history---history%1:28:00:: , the one which reached Christianity---christianity%1:09:00:: by the way of Stoicism---stoicism%1:07:00:: through the Church Fathers---church_father%1:18:00:: of Late Antiquity---antiquity%1:28:00:: .

Producer John Holmes---person%1:03:00:: has chosen a delightful comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: for his season---season%1:28:02:: 's opener---opener%1:11:00:: at Matunuck---location%1:03:00:: in Jean Kerr---person%1:03:00:: 's `` King of Hearts '' .
The dialogue---dialogue%1:10:00:: is sharp , witty and candid - typical `` do n't eat the daisies---daisy%1:20:00:: '' material---material%1:10:00:: - which has stamped the author---author%1:18:00:: throughout her books---book%1:10:00:: and plays---play%1:10:01:: , and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-Sea audience---audience%1:14:00:: liked it .
The story---story%1:10:03:: is of a famous strip---strip%1:10:00:: cartoonist---cartoonist%1:18:00:: , an arty individual---individual%1:03:00:: , whose specialty---specialty%1:07:02:: is the American boy---boy%1:18:00:: and who adopts a 10 - year---year%1:28:01:: old to provide him with fresh idea---idea%1:09:00:: material---material%1:10:00:: .
This is when his troubles---trouble%1:11:00:: begin , not to mention a fledgling artist---artist%1:18:00:: who he hires , and who turns out to have ideas---idea%1:09:00:: of his own , with particular respect to the hero---hero%1:09:00:: 's sweetheart---sweetheart%1:18:00:: secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: .
John Heffernan---person%1:03:00:: , playing Larry Larkin---person%1:03:00:: , the cartoonist---cartoonist%1:18:00:: , carries the show in marvelous fashion---fashion%1:07:00:: .
His portrayal---portrayal%1:04:02:: of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist---artist%1:18:00:: is virtually flawless .
This may be unfortunate , perhaps , from the standpoint---standpoint%1:09:00:: of David Hedison---person%1:03:00:: , Providence---providence%1:15:00:: 's contribution---contribution%1:21:00:: to Hollywood---location%1:03:00:: , who is appearing by special arrangement---arrangement%1:09:01:: with 20th Century-Fox---group%1:03:00:: .
Not that Mr. Hedison---person%1:03:00:: does not make the most of his role---role%1:09:00:: .
But the book---book%1:10:01:: is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist---cartoonist%1:18:00:: , and it has to be that way---way%1:26:00:: .
A word---word%1:10:03:: should be said for Gary Morgan---person%1:03:00:: , a Broadway---broadway%1:15:00:: youngsters---youngster%1:18:00:: who , as the adopted son---son%1:18:00:: , makes life---life%1:09:00:: miserable for nearly everybody and Larkin---person%1:03:00:: in particular---particular%1:09:00:: .
And for his playmate---playmate%1:18:00:: , Francis Coletta---person%1:03:00:: of West Warwick---location%1:03:00:: , who has a bit part---bit_part%1:09:00:: , Billy---person%1:03:00:: .
On the whole , audiences---audience%1:14:00:: will like this performance---performance%1:10:00:: .
It is a tremendous book---book%1:10:00:: , lively , constantly moving , and the Matunuck---location%1:03:00:: cast---cast%1:14:00:: does well by it .
The Newport Playhouse---group%1:03:00:: presents `` Epitaph For George Dillon '' by John Osborne---person%1:03:00:: and Anthony Creighton---person%1:03:00:: , directed by Wallace Gray---person%1:03:00:: .
The cast---cast%1:14:00:: :
The angriest young man---young_man%1:18:00:: in Newport---newport%1:15:00:: last night---night%1:28:00:: was at the Playhouse---group%1:03:00:: , where `` Epitaph for George Dillon '' opened as the jazz festival---jazz_festival%1:04:00:: closed .
For the hero---hero%1:09:00:: of this work---work%1:06:00:: by John Osborne---person%1:03:00:: and Anthony Creighton---person%1:03:00:: is a chap---chap%1:18:00:: embittered by more than the lack---lack%1:26:00:: of beer---beer%1:13:00:: during a jam session---jam_session%1:04:00:: .
He 's mad at a world---world%1:17:01:: he did not make .
Furthermore , he 's something of a scoundrel---scoundrel%1:18:00:: , an artist---artist%1:18:00:: whose mind---mind%1:09:00:: and feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: are all finger-tips---fingertip%1:08:00:: .
This is in contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: to the family---family%1:14:02:: with whom he boards .
They not only think and feel cliches---cliche%1:10:00:: but live cliches---cliche%1:10:00:: as well .
It is into this household---household%1:14:00:: , one eroded by irritations---irritation%1:26:00:: that have tortured the souls---soul%1:12:00:: out of its people---people%1:14:00:: , that George Dillon---person%1:03:00:: enters at the beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: of the play---play%1:10:03:: .
An unsuccessful playwright---playwright%1:18:00:: and actor---actor%1:18:00:: , he has faith---faith%1:09:00:: only in himself and in a talent---talent%1:09:00:: he is not sure exists .
By the end---end%1:11:00:: of the third act---act%1:10:00:: , the artist---artist%1:18:00:: is dead but the body---body%1:08:00:: lingers on , a shell---shell%1:27:00:: among other shells---shell%1:27:00:: .
Not altogether a successful play---play%1:10:03:: , `` Epitaph for George Dillon '' overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling .
Not altogether a successful play---play%1:10:01:: , `` Epitaph for George Dillon '' overcomes through sheer vitality---vitality%1:07:01:: and power---power%1:07:00:: what in a lesser work---work%1:06:00:: might be crippling .
It is awfully talky , for instance , and not all of the talk---talk%1:10:00:: is terribly impressive .
But it strikes sparks---spark%1:19:00:: on occasion and their light---light%1:07:01:: causes all else to be forgotten .
There is a fine second act---act%1:10:00:: , as an example---example%1:09:01:: , one in which Samuel Groom---person%1:03:00:: , as Dillon---person%1:03:00:: , has an opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to blaze away in one impassioned passage---passage%1:10:00:: after another .
This is an exciting young actor---actor%1:18:00:: to watch .
Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way---way%1:07:01:: is Laura Stuart---person%1:03:00:: , whose complete control---control%1:09:01:: of her every movement---movement%1:04:00:: is lovely to watch .
Miss Stuart---person%1:03:00:: is as intensely vibrant as one could wish , almost an icy shriek---shriek%1:10:00:: threatening to explode at any moment---moment%1:28:00:: .
Also fine are Sue Lawless---person%1:03:00:: , as a mother---mother%1:18:00:: more protective and belligerent than a female spider---spider%1:05:00:: and just as destructive , Harold Cherry---person%1:03:00:: , as her scratchy spouse---spouse%1:18:00:: , and Hildy Weissman---person%1:03:00:: , as a vegetable---vegetable%1:13:00:: in human form---form%1:08:00:: .
Wallace Gray---person%1:03:00:: has directed a difficult play---play%1:10:01:: here , usually well , but with just a bit too much physical movement---movement%1:04:00:: in the first act---act%1:10:00:: for my taste---taste%1:12:02:: .
Still , his finale---finale%1:10:00:: is put together with taste---taste%1:09:01:: and a most sensitive projection---projection%1:09:00:: of that pale sustenance---sustenance%1:13:00:: , despair---despair%1:26:00:: .
The Warwick Musical Theater---group%1:03:00:: presents `` Where's Charley ? ''
with music---music%1:10:00:: and lyrics---lyric%1:10:01:: by Frank Loesser---person%1:03:00:: , directed by Christopher Hewett---person%1:03:00:: , choreography---choreography%1:04:00:: by Peter Conlow---person%1:03:00:: , musical direction---direction%1:04:00:: by Samuel Matlowsky---person%1:03:00:: .
The cast---cast%1:14:00:: :
Everybody fell in love with Amy---person%1:03:00:: again last night---night%1:28:00:: at the Warwick Musical Theater---location%1:03:00:: , and Shelley Berman---person%1:03:00:: was to blame .
One of the finest soft shoe---soft-shoe%1:04:00:: tunes---tune%1:10:00:: ever invented , `` Once in Love with Amy '' is also , of course , one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics---love_lyric%1:10:00:: to come out of American musical comedy---musical_comedy%1:10:00:: in our era---era%1:28:00:: .
So the audience---audience%1:14:00:: last night---night%1:28:00:: was all ears---ear%1:09:00:: and eyes---eye%1:08:00:: just after Act---act%1:10:00:: 2 , got a rousing opening chorus---chorus%1:10:00:: , `` Where's Charley ? ''
, and Berman---person%1:03:00:: sifted out all alone on the stage---stage%1:06:00:: with the ambling chords---chord%1:10:00:: and beat---beat%1:10:00:: of the song---song%1:10:00:: just whispering into being---being%1:26:00:: .
It is greatly to Berman---person%1:03:00:: 's credit---credit%1:10:00:: that he made no attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to outdo Ray Bolger---person%1:03:00:: .
He dropped his earlier and delightful hamming---hamming%1:04:00:: , which is about the only way---way%1:07:01:: to handle the old war horse---warhorse%1:06:00:: called `` Charley's Aunt '' , and let himself go with as an appealing an `` Amy---person%1:03:00:: '' as anybody could ask .
In brief , Berman---person%1:03:00:: played himself and not Bolger---person%1:03:00:: .
The big audience---audience%1:14:00:: started applauding even before he had finished .
The whole production---production%1:10:00:: this week---week%1:28:00:: is fresh and lively .
The costumes---costume%1:06:00:: are stunning evocations---evocation%1:09:00:: of the voluminous gowns---gown%1:06:00:: and picture hats---picture_hat%1:06:00:: of the Gibson Girl---gibson_girl%1:18:00:: days---day%1:28:03:: .
The ballet---ballet%1:10:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: is on the nose , especially in the opening number---number%1:10:04:: by `` The New Ashmolean Marching Society---group%1:03:00:: and Students ' Conservatory Band---group%1:03:00:: '' , along with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia---fantasia%1:10:00:: later .
Berman---person%1:03:00:: , whose fame---fame%1:26:01:: has rested in recent years---year%1:28:01:: on his skills---skill%1:09:00:: as a night club---nightclub%1:06:00:: monologist---monologist%1:18:00:: , proved himself very much at home in musical comedy---musical_comedy%1:10:00:: .
Sparrow---sparrow%1:05:00:: size Virginia Gibson---person%1:03:00:: , with sparkling blue eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and a cheerful smile---smile%1:10:00:: , made a suitably perky Amy---person%1:03:00:: , while Melisande Congdon---person%1:03:00:: , as the real aunt---aunt%1:18:00:: , was positively monumental in the very best Gibson Girl---gibson_girl%1:18:00:: manner---manner%1:07:01:: .
It has a fast pace---pace%1:28:00:: , excellent music---music%1:10:00:: , expert direction---direction%1:04:00:: , and not only a good comedian---comedian%1:18:00:: , but an appealing person---person%1:03:00:: in his own right---right%1:04:00:: , Mr. Berman---person%1:03:00:: .
The Broadway Theater League of Rhode Island---group%1:03:00:: presents C. Edwin Knill---person%1:03:00:: 's and Martin Tahse---person%1:03:00:: 's production---production%1:10:00:: of `` Fiorello ! ''
at Veterans Memorial Auditorium---location%1:03:00:: .
The book---book%1:10:00:: is by Jerome Weidman---person%1:03:00:: and George Abbott---person%1:03:00:: , music---music%1:10:00:: by Jerry Bock---person%1:03:00:: , lyrics---lyric%1:10:01:: by Sheldon Harnick---person%1:03:00:: , choreography---choreography%1:04:00:: by Peter Gennaro---person%1:03:00:: , scenery---scenery%1:06:00:: , costumes---costume%1:06:00:: and lighting---lighting%1:06:00:: by William---person%1:03:00:: and Jean Eckart---person%1:03:00:: , musical direction---direction%1:04:00:: by Jack Elliott---person%1:03:00:: , and the production---production%1:10:00:: was directed by Mr. Abbott---person%1:03:00:: .
The cast---cast%1:14:00:: :
This is one of the happier events---event%1:03:00:: of the season---season%1:28:02:: .
The company---company%1:14:02:: which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical---musical%1:10:00:: here last night---night%1:28:00:: and will repeat it twice today---today%1:28:00:: is full of bounce---bounce%1:07:00:: , the politicians---politician%1:18:00:: are in fine voice---voice%1:07:01:: , the chorines---chorine%1:18:00:: evoke happy memories---memory%1:09:02:: , and the Little Flower---person%1:03:00:: rides to break a lance---lance%1:06:00:: again .
I saw `` Fiorello ! '' performed in New York---new_york%1:15:01:: by the original cast---cast%1:14:00:: and I think this company---company%1:14:02:: is every bit as good , and perhaps better .
Certainly in the matter---matter%1:09:01:: of principals---principal%1:18:01:: there is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: lacking .
Bob Carroll---person%1:03:00:: may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance---resemblance%1:07:00:: to LaGuardia---person%1:03:00:: as Tom Bosley---person%1:03:00:: does , but I was amazed at the way---way%1:04:01:: he became more and more Fiorello---person%1:03:00:: as the evening---evening%1:28:00:: progressed , until one had to catch one's self up and remember that this was n't really LaGuardia---person%1:03:00:: come back among us again .
Then Rudy Bond---person%1:03:00:: was simply grand as Ben---person%1:03:00:: , the distraught Republican Party---group%1:03:00:: district---district%1:15:00:: chieftain---chieftain%1:18:01:: .
And Paul Lipson---person%1:03:00:: , as Morris---person%1:03:00:: , the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley---person%1:03:00:: 's dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: , was fine , too .
As for the ladies---lady%1:18:02:: , they were full of charm---charm%1:07:00:: , and sincerity---sincerity%1:07:00:: , and deep and abiding affection---affection%1:12:00:: for this hurrying driving , honest , little man---man%1:18:00:: .
Charlotte Fairchild---person%1:03:00:: was excellent as the loyal Marie---person%1:03:00:: , who became the second Mrs. LaGuardia---person%1:03:00:: , singing and acting---acting%1:04:00:: with remarkable conviction---conviction%1:09:00:: .
Jen Nelson---person%1:03:00:: , as Thea---person%1:03:00:: , his first wife---wife%1:18:00:: , managed to make that short role---role%1:09:00:: impressive .
And little Zeme North---person%1:03:00:: , a Dora---person%1:03:00:: with real spirit---spirit%1:07:02:: and verve---verve%1:07:00:: , was fascinating whether she was singing of her love---love%1:12:00:: for Floyd---person%1:03:00:: , the cop---cop%1:18:00:: who becomes sewer---sewer%1:06:00:: commissioner---commissioner%1:18:00:: and then is promoted into garbage---garbage%1:27:00:: , or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: .
Such fascinating novelties---novelty%1:07:00:: in the score---score%1:10:00:: as the fugual treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: of `` On the Side of the Angels '' and `` Politics and Poker '' were handled splendidly , and I thought Rudy Bond---person%1:03:00:: and his band---band%1:14:00:: of tuneful ward-heelers---ward-heeler%1:18:00:: made `` Little Tin Box '' even better than it was done by the New York---new_york%1:15:01:: cast---cast%1:14:00:: ; all the words---words%1:10:02:: of its clever lyrics---lyric%1:10:01:: came through with perfect clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: .
The party---party%1:14:00:: at Floyd---person%1:03:00:: 's penthouse---penthouse%1:06:00:: gave the `` chorines---chorine%1:18:00:: '' a chance---chance%1:26:00:: for a nostalgic frolic---frolic%1:04:00:: through all those hackneyed routines---routine%1:10:01:: which have become a classic choreographic statement---statement%1:10:00:: of the era---era%1:28:00:: 's nonsense---nonsense%1:10:00:: .
LaGuardia---person%1:03:00:: 's multi lingual rallies---rally%1:14:00:: , when he is running for Congress---group%1:03:00:: , are well staged , and wind up in a wild Jewish folk-dance---folk_dance%1:04:00:: that is really great musical theater---musical_theater%1:10:00:: .
Martin Tahse---person%1:03:00:: has established quite a reputation---reputation%1:26:00:: for himself as a successful stager---stager%1:18:00:: of touring productions---production%1:10:00:: .
The sets---set%1:06:00:: are remarkably elaborate for a road-show---road_show%1:04:00:: that does n't pause long in any one place---place%1:15:00:: , and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption---interruption%1:11:00:: or obtrusiveness---obtrusiveness%1:07:00:: .
( Several times---time%1:11:00:: recently I have wondered whether shows---show%1:04:00:: were being staged for the sake---sake%1:07:00:: of the script---script%1:10:00:: or just to entertain the audience---audience%1:14:00:: with the spectacle---spectacle%1:06:00:: of scenery---scenery%1:06:00:: being shifted right---right%1:04:00:: in front of their eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
I'm glad to say there 's none of that distraction---distraction%1:09:00:: in this `` Fiorello ! ''
It has all been done in superb style---style%1:07:00:: , and the result---result%1:19:00:: is a show---show%1:04:00:: which deserves the support---support%1:04:00:: of every person---person%1:03:00:: hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater---musical_theater%1:10:00:: .
Loew 's Theater---group%1:03:00:: presents `` Where the Boys are '' , an MGM---group%1:03:00:: picture---picture%1:10:02:: produced by Joe Pasternak---person%1:03:00:: and directed by Henry Levin---person%1:03:00:: from a screenplay---screenplay%1:10:00:: by George Wells---person%1:03:00:: .
The cast---cast%1:14:00:: :
Since the hero---hero%1:09:00:: , a sterling and upright fellow---fellow%1:18:00:: , is a rich Brown---group%1:03:00:: senior---senior%1:18:00:: , while two Yalies---person%1:03:00:: are cast as virtual rapists---rapist%1:18:00:: , I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: on `` Where the Boys are '' , but I shall do nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: of the sort---sort%1:09:00:: .
Instead - and not just to prove my objectivity---objectivity%1:07:00:: - I hasten to report that it 's a highly amusing film---film%1:10:01:: which probably does a fairly accurate job---job%1:04:01:: of reporting on the Easter---easter%1:28:00:: vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: shenanigans---shenanigan%1:04:00:: of collegians---collegian%1:18:00:: down in Fort Lauderdale---location%1:03:00:: , and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem---problem%1:10:00:: that most commonly vexes youngsters---youngster%1:18:00:: in this age group---age_group%1:14:00:: - that is to say , sex---sex%1:04:00:: .
The answers---answer%1:10:01:: the girls---girl%1:18:00:: give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual .
If most of them were n't exactly specific - well , that 's the way---way%1:26:00:: it is in life---life%1:09:00:: , I guess .
But at least it 's reassuring to see some teenagers---teenager%1:18:00:: who do n't profess to know all the answers---answer%1:10:01:: and are thinking about their problems---problem%1:26:00:: instead .
`` Where the Boys Are '' also has a juvenile bounce---bounce%1:07:00:: that makes for a refreshing venture---venture%1:04:00:: in comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: .
There are some sharp and whipping lines---line%1:10:02:: and some hilariously funny situations---situation%1:26:00:: - the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge---plunge%1:04:00:: into a nightclub---nightclub%1:06:00:: tank---tank%1:06:00:: where a `` mermaid---mermaid%1:18:00:: '' is performing .
Most of the female faces---face%1:08:00:: are new , or at least not too familiar .
Dolores Hart---person%1:03:00:: , is charming in a leading role---role%1:09:00:: , and quite believable .
I was delighted with Paula Prentiss---person%1:03:00:: ' comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: performance---performance%1:04:01:: , which was as fresh and unstilted as one 's highest hopes---hope%1:12:01:: might ask .
A couple of the males---male%1:18:00:: made good comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: , too - Jim Hutton---person%1:03:00:: and Frank Gorshin---person%1:03:00:: .
The only performance---performance%1:04:01:: which was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux---person%1:03:00:: , but since someone---someone%1:03:00:: had to become the victim---victim%1:18:00:: of despoilers---despoiler%1:18:00:: , just to emphasize that such things---thing%1:11:00:: do happen at these fracases---fracas%1:10:00:: , I suppose this was the attitude---attitude%1:04:00:: the part---part%1:09:01:: called for .
I must say , however , that I preferred the acting---acting%1:04:00:: that had something of a biting edge---edge%1:07:00:: to it .
To anyone who remembers Newport---newport%1:15:00:: at its less than maximum violence---violence%1:26:00:: , this view---view%1:09:02:: of what the boys---boy%1:18:00:: and girls---girl%1:18:00:: do in the springtime---springtime%1:28:00:: before they wing north---north%1:15:00:: for the Jazz Festival---jazz_festival%1:04:00:: ought to prove entertaining .
The second feature---feature%1:10:00:: , `` The Price of Silence '' , is a British---british%1:18:00:: detective story---detective_story%1:10:00:: that will talk your head off .
One hundred years---year%1:28:01:: ago there existed in England---england%1:15:00:: the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom---group%1:03:00:: .
Representing as it did the efforts---effort%1:04:00:: of only unauthorized individuals---individual%1:03:00:: of the Roman---roman_church%1:14:00:: and Anglican Churches---anglican_church%1:14:00:: , and urging a communion---communion%1:10:00:: of prayer---prayer%1:10:02:: unacceptable to Rome---rome%1:14:00:: , this association---association%1:14:00:: produced little fruit---fruit%1:11:00:: , and , in fact , was condemned by the Holy Office---group%1:03:00:: in 1864 .
Now again in 1961 , in England---england%1:15:00:: , there is perhaps nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: in the religious sphere---sphere%1:26:00:: so popularly discussed as Christian unity---unity%1:26:00:: .
The Church Unity Octave---group%1:03:00:: , January---january%1:28:00:: 18 - 25 , was enthusiastically devoted to prayer---prayer%1:10:02:: and discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: by the various churches---church%1:14:00:: .
Many people---people%1:14:00:: seem hopeful , yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment---attainment%1:04:00:: of Christian unity---unity%1:26:00:: in 1961 than there was in 1861 .
But it must be readily seen that the religious picture---picture%1:26:00:: in England---england%1:15:00:: has so greatly changed during these hundred years---year%1:28:01:: as to engender hope---hope%1:12:00:: , at least on the Catholic side---side%1:14:00:: .
For `` the tide is well on the turn '' , as the London Catholic weekly Universe---group%1:03:00:: has written .
I came to England---england%1:15:00:: last summer---summer%1:28:00:: to do research---research%1:04:00:: on the unpublished letters---letter%1:10:00:: of Cardinal Newman---person%1:03:00:: .
As an American Catholic---catholic%1:18:00:: of Irish ancestry---ancestry%1:14:00:: , I came with certain preconceptions---preconception%1:09:00:: and expectations---expectation%1:09:00:: ; being intellectually influenced by Newman---person%1:03:00:: and the general 19th century---century%1:28:00:: literature---literature%1:10:00:: of England---england%1:15:00:: , I knew only a Protestant---protestant%1:14:00:: dominated country---country%1:14:01:: .
Since arriving here , however , I have formed a far different religious picture---picture%1:09:00:: of present-day England---england%1:15:00:: .
In representing part---part%1:24:00:: of this new picture---picture%1:26:00:: , I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences---experience%1:09:00:: , reactions---reaction%1:09:00:: and judgments---judgment%1:09:04:: ; but my primary aim---aim%1:09:00:: is to transcribe what Englishmen---englishman%1:18:00:: themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman---roman_church%1:14:00:: and Anglican Churches---anglican_church%1:14:00:: and about the present religious state---state%1:03:00:: of England---england%1:15:00:: .
Since the Protestant clergy---clergy%1:14:00:: for the most part wear gray---gray%1:06:00:: or some variant from the wholly black suit---suit%1:06:00:: , my Roman collar---roman_collar%1:06:00:: and black garb---garb%1:06:00:: usually identify me in England---england%1:15:00:: as a Roman Catholic---roman_catholic%1:18:00:: cleric---cleric%1:18:00:: .
In any case , I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy---courtesy%1:04:00:: by Englishmen---englishman%1:18:00:: , even in Devonshire---location%1:03:00:: and Cornwall---location%1:03:00:: , where anti Catholic feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: has supposedly existed the strongest and longest .
Nowhere have I seen public expression---expression%1:10:04:: of anti-Catholicism---anti-catholicism%1:09:00:: .
On my first Guy Fawkes Day---guy_fawkes_day%1:28:00:: here , I found Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: as well as non Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: celebrating with the traditional fireworks---firework%1:06:00:: and bonfires---bonfire%1:11:00:: , and was told that most Englishmen---englishman%1:18:00:: either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance---significance%1:07:00:: of the day---day%1:28:01:: .
A Birmingham---birmingham%1:15:00:: newspaper---newspaper%1:14:00:: printed in a column---column%1:10:00:: for children---child%1:18:00:: an article---article%1:10:00:: entitled `` The True Story---story%1:10:03:: of Guy Fawkes---person%1:03:00:: '' , which began :
`` When you pile your '' guy---guy%1:06:01:: `` on the bonfire---bonfire%1:11:00:: tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: , I wonder how much of the true story---story%1:10:04:: of Guy Fawkes---person%1:03:00:: you will remember ?
In the 355 years---year%1:28:01:: since the first Guy Fawkes Night , much of the story---story%1:10:03:: has been forgotten , so here is a reminder---reminder%1:09:00:: '' .
The article---article%1:10:00:: proceeded to give an inaccurate account---account%1:10:00:: of a catholic plot---plot%1:09:00:: to kill King James /1 1---person%1:03:00:: , .
In spite of the increase---increase%1:22:00:: in numbers---number%1:23:00:: and prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: brought about by the conversions---conversion%1:04:01:: of Newman---person%1:03:00:: and other Tractarians---tractarian%1:18:00:: of the 1840 's and 1850 's , the Catholic segment---segment%1:06:00:: of England---england%1:15:00:: one hundred years---year%1:28:01:: ago was a very small one ( four per cent---percent%1:24:00:: , or 800000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing---hearing%1:26:00:: from the general public---public%1:14:00:: .
The return---return%1:04:02:: of the Catholic hierarchy---hierarchy%1:14:01:: in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation---disapprobation%1:10:00:: and , in fact , was charged with being a gesture---gesture%1:04:02:: of disloyalty---disloyalty%1:07:00:: .
In 1864 Newman---person%1:03:00:: professedly had to write his Apologia---apologia%1:10:01:: with his keenest feelings---feelings%1:12:00:: in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing---hearing%1:26:00:: from English readers---reader%1:18:00:: .
Now , in 1961 , the Catholic population---population%1:14:00:: of England---england%1:15:00:: is still quite small ( ten per cent---percent%1:24:00:: , or 5 million ) ; yet it represents a very considerable percentage---percentage%1:21:00:: of the churchgoing population---population%1:14:00:: .
A Protestant woman---woman%1:18:00:: marveled to me over the large crowds---crowd%1:14:00:: going in and out of the Birmingham Oratory---group%1:03:00:: ( Catholic ) Church---church%1:06:00:: on Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: mornings---morning%1:28:00:: .
She found this a marvel---marvel%1:11:00:: because , as she said , only six per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of English people---english_people%1:18:00:: are churchgoers---churchgoer%1:18:00:: .
She may not have been exact on this number---number%1:23:00:: , but others here feel quite certain that the percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: would be less than ten .
From many sides---side%1:14:00:: come remarks---remark%1:10:00:: that Protestant churches---church%1:06:00:: are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals---cathedral%1:06:00:: look all but empty during services---service%1:04:01:: .
A Catholic priest---priest%1:18:00:: recently recounted how in the chapel---chapel%1:06:00:: of a large city university---city_university%1:06:00:: , following Anglican evensong---evensong%1:28:00:: , at which there was a congregation---congregation%1:14:00:: of twelve , he celebrated Mass---mass%1:04:00:: before more than a hundred .
The Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: themselves are the first to admit the great falling off---falling_off%1:22:00:: in effective membership---membership%1:14:00:: in their churches---church%1:06:00:: .
According to a newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: report---report%1:10:00:: of the 1961 statistics---statistic%1:09:00:: of the Church of England---church_of_england%1:14:00:: , the `` total---total%1:06:00:: of confirmed members---member%1:18:00:: is 9748000 , but only 2887671 are registered on the parochial church rolls---church_roll%1:10:00:: '' , and `` over 27 million people---person%1:03:00:: in England---england%1:15:00:: are baptized into the Church of England---church_of_england%1:14:00:: , but roughly only a tenth of them continue '' .
An amazing article---article%1:10:00:: in the Manchester Guardian of last November---november%1:28:00:: , entitled `` Fate---fate%1:11:00:: of Redundant Churches---church%1:06:00:: '' , states than an Archbishops---archbishop%1:18:00:: ' Commission---commission%1:14:00:: `` reported last month---month%1:28:01:: that in the Church of England---church_of_england%1:14:00:: alone there are 790 churches---church%1:06:00:: which are redundant now , or will be in 20 years---year%1:28:01:: ' time---time%1:28:05:: .
A further 260 Anglican churches---church%1:06:00:: have been demolished since 1948 '' .
And in the last five years---year%1:28:01:: , the `` Methodist chapel---chapel%1:06:00:: committee---committee%1:14:00:: has authorized the demolition---demolition%1:11:00:: or , more often , the sale---sale%1:04:00:: of 764 chapels---chapel%1:06:00:: '' .
Most of these former churches---church%1:06:00:: are now used as warehouses---warehouse%1:06:00:: , but `` neither Anglicans---anglican%1:18:00:: nor Nonconformists---nonconformist%1:18:01:: object to selling churches---church%1:06:00:: to Roman Catholics---roman_catholic%1:18:00:: '' , and have done so .
While it must be said that these same Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: have built some new churches---church%1:06:00:: during this period---period%1:28:00:: , and that religious population shifts---population_shift%1:11:00:: have emptied churches---church%1:06:00:: , a principal reason---reason%1:10:01:: for this phenomenon---phenomenon%1:11:00:: of redundancy---redundancy%1:07:00:: is that fewer Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: are going to church---church%1:04:00:: .
It should be admitted , too , that there is a good percentage---percentage%1:24:00:: of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: ( one paper---paper%1:10:03:: writes 50 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: ) .
Still , it is clear from such reports---report%1:10:00:: , and apparently clear from the remarks---remark%1:10:00:: of many people---person%1:03:00:: , that Protestants---protestant%1:18:00:: are decreasing and Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: increasing .
An Anglican clergyman---clergyman%1:18:00:: in Oxford---oxford%1:15:00:: sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true .
A century---century%1:28:00:: ago , Newman---person%1:03:00:: saw that liberalism---liberalism%1:09:00:: ( what we now might call secularism---secularism%1:09:00:: ) would gradually but definitely make its mark---mark%1:07:02:: on English Protestantism---group%1:03:00:: , and that even high Anglicanism---high_anglicanism%1:09:00:: would someday no longer be a `` serviceable breakwater---breakwater%1:06:00:: against doctrinal errors---error%1:09:00:: more fundamental than its own '' .
That day---day%1:28:03:: is perhaps today---today%1:28:00:: , 1961 , and it seems no longer very meaningful to call England---england%1:15:00:: a `` Protestant country---country%1:14:01:: '' .
One of the ironies---irony%1:07:00:: of the present crusade---crusade%1:04:00:: for Christian unity---unity%1:26:00:: is that there are not , relatively speaking , many real Christians---christian%1:18:00:: to unite .
Many English Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: are proud of their Catholicism---catholicism%1:09:00:: and know that they are in a new ascendancy---ascendancy%1:26:00:: .
The London Universe devoted its centenary issue---issue%1:10:00:: last December---december%1:28:00:: 8 to mapping out various aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: of Catholic progress---progress%1:04:01:: during the last one hundred years---year%1:28:01:: .
With traditional nationalistic spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: , some Englishmen---englishman%1:18:00:: claim---claim%1:10:00:: that English---english%1:18:00:: Catholicism---catholicism%1:09:00:: is Catholicism---catholicism%1:09:00:: at its best .
I have found myself saying with other foreigners---foreigner%1:18:00:: here that English Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: are good Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: .
It has been my experience---experience%1:09:00:: to find as many men---man%1:18:00:: as women---woman%1:18:00:: in church---church%1:06:00:: , and to hear almost everyone in church---church%1:06:00:: congregations---congregation%1:14:00:: reciting the Latin---latin%1:10:00:: prayers---prayer%1:04:00:: and responses---response%1:10:03:: at Mass---mass%1:04:00:: .
They hope---hope%1:12:00:: , of course , to reclaim the non-Catholic---non-catholic%1:18:00:: population---population%1:14:00:: to the Catholic faith---faith%1:14:00:: , and at every Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: Benediction---benediction%1:04:00:: they recite by heart the `` Prayer for England '' :
`` O Blessed Virgin Mary---virgin_mary%1:18:00:: , Mother---mother%1:18:00:: of God---god%1:18:01:: and our most gentle queen---queen%1:18:00:: and mother---mother%1:18:00:: , look down in mercy---mercy%1:12:00:: upon England---england%1:15:00:: , thy '' dowry---dowry%1:21:00:: `` , and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee .
Intercede for our separated brethren---brother%1:18:02:: , that with us in the one true fold---fold%1:14:00:: they may be united to the chief Shepherd---shepherd%1:18:01:: , the vicar---vicar%1:18:00:: of thy Son---son%1:18:01:: '' .
A hymn---hymn%1:10:00:: often to be heard in Catholic churches---church%1:06:00:: is `` Faith of our Fathers '' , which glories in England---england%1:15:00:: 's ancient faith---faith%1:09:00:: that endured persecution---persecution%1:04:00:: , and which proclaims :
`` Faith---faith%1:14:00:: of our Fathers---father%1:18:03:: : Mary---virgin_mary%1:18:00:: 's prayers---prayer%1:10:00:: / Shall win our country---country%1:14:01:: back to thee '' .
The English saints---saint%1:18:03:: are widely venerated , quite naturally , and now there is great hope---hope%1:09:00:: that the Forty Martyrs---person%1:03:00:: and Cardinal Newman---person%1:03:00:: will soon be canonized .
Because they have kept the faith---faith%1:09:00:: of their medieval fathers---father%1:18:04:: , English Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: have always strongly resented the charge---charge%1:10:00:: of being `` English '' .
I have not seen this charge---charge%1:10:00:: made during my stay---stay%1:04:00:: here , but apparently it is still in the air .
For example , a writer---writer%1:18:01:: in a recent number---number%1:10:00:: of The Queen hyperbolically states that `` of the myriad imprecations---imprecation%1:10:00:: the only one which the English Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: really resent is the suggestion---suggestion%1:09:00:: that they are ' un English '' ' .
In this connection---connection%1:24:00:: , it has been observed that the increasing number---number%1:23:00:: of Irish---irish%1:18:00:: Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: , priests---priest%1:18:00:: and laity---laity%1:14:00:: , in England---england%1:15:00:: , while certainly seen as good for Catholicism---catholicism%1:09:00:: , is nevertheless a source---source%1:15:00:: of embarrassment---embarrassment%1:12:00:: for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: , especially when these Irishmen---irishman%1:18:00:: offer to remind their Christian brethren---brother%1:18:02:: of this good---good%1:07:01:: .
One of the more noteworthy changes---change%1:11:00:: that have taken place since the mid 19th century---century%1:28:00:: is the situation---situation%1:26:00:: of Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: at Oxford---group%1:03:00:: and Cambridge Universities---group%1:03:00:: .
At Oxford---group%1:03:00:: one hundred years---year%1:28:01:: ago there were very few Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: , partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854 .
Moreover , for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation---representation%1:04:01:: in the city---city%1:15:00:: to care for their religious needs---need%1:26:00:: .
Now , not only are there considerably more laity---laity%1:14:00:: as students---student%1:18:00:: and professors---professor%1:18:00:: at Oxford---group%1:03:00:: , but there are also numerous houses---house%1:14:04:: of religious orders---religious_order%1:14:00:: existing in respectable and friendly relations---relations%1:24:00:: with the non Catholic---non-catholic%1:18:00:: members---member%1:18:00:: of the University---university%1:14:00:: .
Some Catholic priests---priest%1:18:00:: lecture there ; Catholic seminarians---seminarian%1:18:00:: attend tutorials---tutorial%1:10:00:: and row on the Cherwell---location%1:03:00:: with non-Catholic---non-catholic%1:18:00:: students---student%1:18:00:: .
Further evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that Roman Catholicism---roman_catholicism%1:09:00:: enjoys a more favorable position---favorable_position%1:07:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: than in 1861 is the respectful attention---attention%1:04:01:: given to it in the mass media of England---england%1:15:00:: .
The general tone---tone%1:10:01:: of articles---article%1:10:00:: appearing in such important newspapers---newspaper%1:14:00:: as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Observer implies a kindly recognition---recognition%1:26:00:: that the Catholic Church---catholic_church%1:14:00:: is now at least of equal stature---stature%1:26:00:: in England---england%1:15:00:: with the Protestant churches---church%1:14:00:: .
On successive Sundays---sunday%1:28:00:: during October---october%1:28:00:: , 1960 , Paul Ferris---person%1:03:00:: ( a non-Catholic---non-catholic%1:18:00:: ) wrote articles---article%1:10:00:: in the Observer---group%1:03:00:: depicting clergymen---clergyman%1:18:00:: of the Church of England---church_of_england%1:14:00:: , the Church of Rome---group%1:03:00:: and the Nonconformist Church---group%1:03:00:: .
The Catholic priest---priest%1:18:00:: , though somewhat superficially drawn , easily came out the best .
There were many letters---letter%1:10:00:: of strong protest---protest%1:10:00:: against the portrait---portrait%1:06:00:: of the Anglican clergyman---clergyman%1:18:00:: , who was indeed portrayed as a man---man%1:18:00:: not particularly concerned with religious matters---matter%1:09:00:: and without really very much to do as clergyman---clergyman%1:18:00:: .
Such a series---series%1:14:00:: of articles---article%1:10:00:: was certainly never printed in the public press---public_press%1:10:00:: of mid Victorian England---england%1:15:00:: .
There was so much interest---interest%1:09:00:: shown in this present-day venture---venture%1:04:00:: that it was continued on B.B.C.---group%1:03:00:: , where comments---comment%1:10:00:: were equally made by an Anglican parson---parson%1:18:00:: , a Free Church---group%1:03:00:: minister---minister%1:18:00:: and a Catholic priest---priest%1:18:00:: .
Catholic priests---priest%1:18:00:: have frequently appeared on television programs---television_program%1:10:00:: , sometimes discussing the Christian faith---faith%1:09:00:: on an equal footing---footing%1:26:00:: with Protestant clergymen---clergyman%1:18:00:: .
A notable example---example%1:09:00:: of this was the discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: of Christian unity---unity%1:26:00:: by the Catholic Archbishop---archbishop%1:18:00:: of Liverpool---liverpool%1:15:00:: , Dr. Heenan---person%1:03:00:: , and the Anglican Archbishop---archbishop%1:18:00:: of York---location%1:03:00:: , Dr. Ramsey---person%1:03:00:: , recently appointed Archbishop---archbishop%1:18:00:: of Canterbury---location%1:03:00:: .
The good feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: which exists between these two important church---church%1:14:00:: figures---figure%1:18:00:: is now well known in England---england%1:15:00:: .
The Holy Sacrifice---holy_sacrament%1:04:00:: of the Mass---mass%1:04:00:: with commentary---commentary%1:10:00:: has been televised several times---time%1:11:00:: in recent months---month%1:28:01:: .
And it was interesting to observe that B.B.C.---group%1:03:00:: . 's television---television%1:10:00:: film---film%1:10:01:: on Christmas Eve---christmas_eve%1:28:00:: was The Bells of St. Mary's .
Of course , the crowning event---event%1:03:00:: that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: of English religious history---history%1:28:00:: was the friendly visit---visit%1:04:02:: paid by Dr. Fisher---person%1:03:00:: , then Anglican Archbishop---archbishop%1:18:00:: of Canterbury---location%1:03:00:: , to the Vatican---vatican%1:06:00:: last December---december%1:28:00:: .
It was the first time---time%1:11:00:: an English Primate---primate%1:18:00:: has done this since the 14th century---century%1:28:00:: .
English Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: reacted to this event---event%1:03:00:: with moderate but real hope---hope%1:12:00:: .
Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope---hope%1:12:00:: in England---england%1:15:00:: : statistics---statistic%1:09:00:: of the increasing numbers---number%1:23:00:: of converts---convert%1:18:00:: and Irish---irish%1:18:00:: Catholic immigrants---immigrant%1:18:00:: ; news---news%1:10:00:: of a Protestant minister---minister%1:18:00:: in Leamington---location%1:03:00:: who has offered to allow a Catholic priest---priest%1:18:00:: to preach from his pulpit---pulpit%1:06:00:: ; a report---report%1:10:00:: that a Catholic nun---nun%1:18:00:: had been requested to teach in a non-Catholic---non-catholic%1:18:00:: secondary school---secondary_school%1:14:00:: during the sickness---sickness%1:26:00:: of one of its masters---master%1:18:06:: ; the startling statement---statement%1:10:00:: in a respectable periodical---periodical%1:10:00:: that `` Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: , if the present system---system%1:09:00:: is still in operation , will constitute almost one-third---one-third%1:23:00:: of the House of Lords---group%1:03:00:: in the next generation---generation%1:28:00:: '' ; a report---report%1:10:00:: that 200 Protestant clergymen---clergyman%1:18:00:: and laity---laity%1:14:00:: attended a votive Mass---mass%1:04:00:: offered for Christian unity---unity%1:26:00:: at a Catholic church---catholic_church%1:14:00:: in Slough---location%1:03:00:: during the Church---church%1:14:00:: Unity---unity%1:07:00:: Octave---octave%1:28:00:: .

- Fetch me the copies---copy%1:10:00:: of everything B and C companies---company%1:14:03:: have requisitioned in the last six months---month%1:28:01:: .
- The last six months---month%1:28:01:: , sir---sir%1:18:00:: ?
There 's a lot of waste---waste%1:04:00:: going on here .
This is no damned holiday---holiday%1:28:00:: , Beckworth---person%1:03:00:: .
- Yes , sir---sir%1:18:00:: .
Beckworth---person%1:03:00:: left the tent---tent%1:06:00:: .
Below he could see the bright torches---torch%1:06:02:: lighting the riverbank---riverbank%1:17:00:: .
The colonel---colonel%1:18:00:: crouched tensely on one of the folding chairs---folding_chair%1:06:00:: , methodically tearing at his thumbnail---thumbnail%1:08:00:: .
The bombproof---bombproof%1:06:00:: was a low-ceilinged structure---structure%1:06:00:: of heavy timbers---timber%1:06:01:: covered with earth---earth%1:27:00:: .
It stood some fifty paces---pace%1:23:01:: from the edge---edge%1:06:00:: of the bank---bank%1:17:01:: .
From the outside---outside%1:15:01:: , it seemed no more than a low drumlin---drumlin%1:17:00:: , a lump---lump%1:14:00:: on the dark earth---earth%1:17:01:: .
A crude ladder---ladder%1:06:00:: ran down to a wooden floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
Two slits---slit%1:06:00:: enabled observers---observer%1:18:00:: to watch across the river---river%1:17:00:: .
The place---place%1:15:00:: smelled strongly of rank , fertile earth---earth%1:27:00:: , rotting wood---wood%1:27:00:: and urine---urine%1:27:00:: .
The plank---plank%1:27:00:: floor---floor%1:06:00:: was slimed beneath Watson---person%1:03:00:: 's boots---boot%1:06:00:: .
At least the Union officer---officer%1:18:03:: had been decent enough to provide a candle---candle%1:06:00:: .
There was no place---place%1:15:00:: to sit , but Watson---person%1:03:00:: walked slowly from the ladder---ladder%1:06:00:: to the window---window%1:06:00:: slits---slit%1:06:00:: and back , stooping slightly to avoid striking his head---head%1:08:00:: on the heavy beams---beam%1:06:00:: .
In the corner---corner%1:15:02:: was the soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: with the white flag---white_flag%1:06:00:: .
He stood stiffly erect , clutching the staff---staff%1:06:00:: , his body---body%1:08:00:: half hidden by the limp cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: hardly looked at him .
The man---man%1:18:00:: had come floundering aboard the flat-bottomed barge---barge%1:06:00:: at the last instant---instant%1:28:00:: , brandishing the flag of truce---flag_of_truce%1:06:00:: .
Someone---someone%1:03:00:: had hauled him over the side---side%1:15:02:: , and he had remained silent while they crossed .
An officer---officer%1:18:03:: with a squad---squad%1:14:01:: of men---man%1:18:03:: had been waiting on the bank---bank%1:17:01:: .
The men---man%1:18:00:: in the boats---boat%1:06:00:: had started yelling happily at first sight---sight%1:09:01:: of the officer---officer%1:18:03:: , two of them calling him Billy---person%1:03:00:: .
When the boat---boat%1:06:00:: had touched , the weaker ones and the two wounded men---man%1:18:00:: had been lifted out and carried away by the soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: had presented his pouch---pouch%1:06:00:: and been led to the bombproof---bombproof%1:06:00:: .
The officer---officer%1:18:03:: had told him that both lists---list%1:10:00:: must be checked .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: had given his name---name%1:10:00:: and asked for a safe-conduct---safe-conduct%1:10:00:: pass---pass%1:28:00:: .
The officer---officer%1:18:03:: , surprised , said he would have to see .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: had nodded absently and muttered that he would check the lists---list%1:10:00:: himself later .
He had peered through the darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: at the rampart---rampart%1:06:00:: .
The men---man%1:18:00:: he would take back across the river---river%1:17:00:: stood there , but he turned away from them .
He wanted no part---part%1:24:00:: of the emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: of the exchange---exchange%1:10:00:: , no memory---memory%1:09:02:: of the joy---joy%1:12:00:: and gratitude---gratitude%1:12:00:: that other men---man%1:18:00:: felt .
He had hoped to be alone in the bombproof---bombproof%1:06:00:: , but the soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: had followed him .
Though Watson---person%1:03:00:: carefully ignored the man---man%1:18:00:: , he could not deny his presence---presence%1:26:00:: .
Perhaps it would be better to speak to him , since silence---silence%1:07:01:: could not exorcise his form---form%1:08:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: glanced briefly at him , seeing only a body---body%1:08:00:: rigidly erect behind the languid banner---banner%1:06:00:: .
If my pass---pass%1:28:00:: is approved , I may be a half hour---half-hour%1:28:00:: .
The soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: answered in a curious , muffled voice---voice%1:10:00:: , his lips---lip%1:08:00:: barely moving .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: turned away and did not see the man---man%1:18:00:: 's knees---knee%1:08:00:: buckle and his body---body%1:08:00:: sag .
- Yes , sir---sir%1:18:00:: .
He had acknowledged the man---man%1:18:00:: .
It was easier to think now , Watson---person%1:03:00:: decided .
The stiff figure---figure%1:08:00:: in the corner---corner%1:15:02:: no longer blocked his thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: .
He paced slowly , stooping , staring at the damp , slippery floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
He tried to order the words---word%1:10:00:: of the three Union officers---officer%1:18:03:: , seeking to create some coherent portrait---portrait%1:06:00:: of the dead boy---boy%1:18:00:: .
His lack---lack%1:26:00:: of success---success%1:04:00:: steadily eroded his interest---interest%1:09:00:: .
He stopped pacing , leaned against the dank , timbered wall---wall%1:06:00:: and let his mind---mind%1:09:00:: drift .
A feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: of futility---futility%1:07:00:: , an enervation---enervation%1:07:00:: of mind---mind%1:09:00:: greater than any fatigue---fatigue%1:26:00:: he had ever known , seeped through him .
What in the name of God was he doing , crouched in a timbered pit---pit%1:17:00:: on the wrong bank---bank%1:17:01:: of the river---river%1:17:00:: ?
Why had he crossed the dark water---water%1:17:00:: , to bring back a group---group%1:03:00:: of reclaimed soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole---hole%1:17:02:: ?
He grew annoyed and at the same time surprised at that emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: .
He was conscious of a growing sense---sense%1:09:05:: of absurdity---absurdity%1:10:00:: .
Hillman---person%1:03:00:: had written it all out , had n't he ?
Was n't the report---report%1:10:03:: official enough ?
Hillman---person%1:03:00:: had ordered him not to leave the far bank---bank%1:17:01:: .
Prompted by a guilty urge---urge%1:16:00:: , he had disobeyed the order---order%1:10:03:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: he respected .
To tell John---person%1:03:00:: something he would find out for himself .
The figure---figure%1:08:00:: in the corner---corner%1:15:02:: belched loudly , a deep , liquid eruption---eruption%1:11:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: snorted and then laughed aloud .
The soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: 's voice---voice%1:10:00:: was muffled again , stricken with chagrin---chagrin%1:12:00:: .
He clutched the staff---staff%1:06:00:: , and his dark eyes---eye%1:08:00:: blinked apologetically .
- ' Scuse me , sir---sir%1:18:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: ran up the ladder---ladder%1:06:00:: and stood for a second---second%1:28:00:: sucking in the cool air---air%1:27:00:: that smelled of mud---mud%1:27:00:: and river---river%1:17:00:: weeds---weed%1:20:00:: .
To his left---left%1:15:00:: , the two skiffs---skiff%1:06:00:: dented their sharp bows---bow%1:06:01:: into the soft bank---bank%1:17:01:: .
The flat-bottomed boat---boat%1:06:00:: swung slowly to the pull---pull%1:19:00:: of the current---current%1:11:00:: .
A soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: held the end---end%1:15:00:: of a frayed rope---rope%1:06:00:: .
Three Union guards---guard%1:18:03:: appeared , carrying their rifles---rifle%1:06:00:: at ready---ready%1:26:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: stared at them curiously .
They were stocky men---men%1:14:00:: , well fed and clean-shaven , with neat uniforms---uniform%1:06:00:: and sturdy boots---boot%1:06:00:: .
Behind them shambled a long column---column%1:14:00:: of weak , tattered men---men%1:14:00:: .
The thin gray figures---figure%1:08:00:: raised a hoarse , cawing cry---cry%1:10:00:: like the call---call%1:10:03:: of a bird---bird%1:05:00:: flock---flock%1:14:00:: .
They moved toward the skiffs---skiff%1:06:00:: with shocking eagerness---eagerness%1:12:00:: , elbowing and shoving .
Four men---men%1:14:00:: were knocked down , but did not attempt to rise .
They crept down the muddy slope---slope%1:17:00:: toward the waiting boats---boat%1:06:00:: .
The Union soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: grounded arms---arms%1:06:00:: and settled into healthy , indifferent postures---posture%1:07:00:: to watch the feeble boarding---boarding%1:04:00:: of the skiffs---skiff%1:06:00:: .
The crawling men---men%1:14:00:: tried to rise and fell again .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: watched two---two%1:23:00:: of them flounder into the shallow water---water%1:17:00:: and listened to their voices---voice%1:10:00:: beg shrilly .
In a confused , soaked and stumbling shift---shift%1:11:00:: of bodies---body%1:08:00:: and lifting arms---arm%1:08:00:: , the two men---man%1:18:00:: were dragged into the same skiff---skiff%1:06:00:: .
The third crawling man---man%1:18:00:: forced himself erect .
He swayed like a drunkard---drunkard%1:18:00:: , his arms---arm%1:08:00:: milling in slow circles---circle%1:25:00:: .
He paced forward unsteadily , leaning too far back , his head---head%1:08:00:: tilted oddly .
His steps---step%1:04:00:: were short and stiff , and , with his head---head%1:08:00:: thrown back , his progress---progress%1:04:00:: was a supercilious strut---strut%1:04:00:: .
He appeared to be peering haughtily down his nose at the crowded and unclean vessel---vessel%1:06:00:: that would carry him to freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: .
He stalked into the water---water%1:17:00:: and fell heavily over the side---side%1:06:00:: of the flat-bottomed barge---barge%1:06:00:: , his weight---weight%1:07:00:: nearly swamping the craft---craft%1:06:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: looked for the fourth man---man%1:18:00:: .
He had reached the three passive guards---guard%1:18:03:: ; he crept in an incertain manner---manner%1:07:02:: , patting the ground---ground%1:17:00:: before him .
The guards---guard%1:18:03:: did not look at him .
The figure---figure%1:08:00:: on the earth---earth%1:17:01:: halted , seemingly bewildered .
He sank back on his thin haunches---haunch%1:08:01:: like a weary hound---hound%1:05:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: watched the creeping figure---figure%1:08:00:: .
He felt a spectator---spectator%1:18:00:: interest---interest%1:09:00:: .
Would the man---man%1:18:00:: make it or not ?
If only there was a clock---clock%1:06:00:: for him to crawl against .
If he failed to reach the riverbank---riverbank%1:17:00:: in five minutes---minute%1:28:00:: , say , then the skiffs---skiff%1:06:00:: would pull away and leave him groping in the mud---mud%1:27:00:: .
Say three minutes---minute%1:28:00:: to make it sporting .
Still the guards---guard%1:18:03:: did not move , but stood inert , aloof from the slow scrambling man---man%1:18:00:: .
The figure---figure%1:08:00:: halted , and Watson---person%1:03:00:: gasped .
The man---man%1:18:00:: began to creep in the wrong direction---direction%1:15:00:: , deceived by a slight rise---rise%1:17:00:: in the ground---ground%1:17:00:: !
He turned slowly and began to crawl back up the bank---bank%1:17:01:: toward the rampart---rampart%1:06:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: raced for him , his boots---boot%1:06:00:: slamming the soft earth---earth%1:27:00:: .
The guards---guard%1:18:03:: came to life with astonishing menace---menace%1:26:00:: .
They spun and flung their rifles---rifle%1:06:00:: up .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: gesticulated wildly .
One man---man%1:18:00:: dropped to his knee---knee%1:08:00:: for better aim---aim%1:04:00:: .
The guards---guard%1:18:03:: lowered their rifles---rifle%1:06:00:: and their rifles---rifle%1:06:00:: and peered at Watson---person%1:03:00:: with sullen , puzzled faces---face%1:08:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: pounded to the crawling man---man%1:18:00:: and stopped , panting heavily .
He reached down and closed his fingers---finger%1:08:00:: on the man---man%1:18:00:: 's upper arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
Beneath his clutch---clutch%1:04:00:: , a flat strip---strip%1:17:00:: of muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: surged on the bone---bone%1:08:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: bent awkwardly and lifted the man---man%1:18:00:: to his feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: stared into a cadaverous face---face%1:07:00:: .
Two clotted balls---ball%1:25:00:: the color---color%1:07:00:: of mucus---mucus%1:08:00:: rolled between fiery lids---lid%1:08:00:: .
Light sticks---stick%1:06:00:: of fingers---finger%1:08:00:: , the tips---tip%1:15:00:: gummy with dark earth---earth%1:27:00:: , patted at Watson---person%1:03:00:: 's throat---throat%1:08:00:: .
The man---man%1:18:00:: 's voice---voice%1:10:00:: was a sweet , patient whisper---whisper%1:10:00:: .
- Henry---person%1:03:00:: said that he 'd take my arm---arm%1:08:00:: and get me right there .
But you ai n't Henry---person%1:03:00:: .
How far could it be , Watson---person%1:03:00:: thought bleakly , how far can a blind man crawl ?
Another body length---body_length%1:23:00:: or all the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of his nighted life---life%1:28:02:: ?
Not like us fellas---fella%1:18:00:: .
It raises the voice---voice%1:10:00:: , bein in camp---camp%1:06:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: stumbled down the bank---bank%1:17:01:: .
The man---man%1:18:00:: leaned his frail body---body%1:08:00:: against Watson---person%1:03:00:: 's shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
He was no heavier than a child---child%1:18:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: paused for breath---breath%1:04:00:: .
The man---man%1:18:00:: wheezed weakly , his fetid breath---breath%1:27:00:: beating softly against Watson---person%1:03:00:: 's neck---neck%1:08:00:: .
His sweet whisper---whisper%1:10:00:: came after great effort---effort%1:04:00:: .
I wish you was Henry---person%1:03:00:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: supported the man---man%1:18:00:: to the edge---edge%1:06:00:: of the bank---bank%1:17:01:: and passed the frail figure---figure%1:08:00:: over the bow---bow%1:06:02:: of the nearest skiff---skiff%1:06:00:: .
The man---man%1:18:00:: swayed on a thwart---thwart%1:06:00:: , turning his ruined eyes---eye%1:08:00:: from side---side%1:15:02:: to side---side%1:15:02:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: turned away , sickened for the first time in many months---month%1:28:01:: .
He heard the patient voice---voice%1:10:00:: calling .
- Henry---person%1:03:00:: ?
Where are you , Henry---person%1:03:00:: ?
Watson---person%1:03:00:: snatched a deep breath---breath%1:04:00:: .
He stood with his back---back%1:08:00:: to the skiff---skiff%1:06:00:: .
The men---man%1:18:00:: mewed and scratched , begging to be taken away .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: spoke bewilderedly to the dark night---night%1:28:00:: flecked with pine-knot---pine_knot%1:27:00:: torches---torch%1:06:02:: .
Intelligence---intelligence%1:09:00:: jabbed at him accusingly .
He had not felt that during the afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: .
All his emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: had been inward , self-conscious .
In war---war%1:26:00:: , on a night---night%1:28:00:: like this , it was only the outward emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: that mattered , what could be flung out into the darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: to damage others .
John---person%1:03:00:: 's type---type%1:09:00:: of man---man%1:18:00:: allowed this sort---sort%1:09:00:: of thing---thing%1:11:00:: to happen .
What a fool---fool%1:18:01:: he had been to think of his brother---brother%1:18:00:: !
So Charles---person%1:03:00:: was dead .
His name---name%1:10:00:: had been crossed off a list---list%1:10:00:: .
Already his cool body---body%1:08:00:: lay in the ground---ground%1:17:00:: .
What words---word%1:10:00:: had any meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: ?
What had he thought of , to go to John---person%1:03:00:: , grovel and beg understanding---understanding%1:09:03:: ?
To confess with a canvas---canvas%1:06:00:: chair---chair%1:06:00:: as a prie-dieu---prie-dieu%1:06:00:: , gouging at his heart---heart%1:09:00:: until a rough and stupid hand---hand%1:08:00:: bade him rise and go ?
Men---man%1:18:00:: were slaughtered every day , tumbled into eternity---eternity%1:28:00:: like so many torn parcels---parcel%1:04:00:: flung down a portable chute---chute%1:06:00:: .
What made him think John---person%1:03:00:: had a right---right%1:07:00:: to witness his brother---brother%1:18:00:: 's humiliation---humiliation%1:12:00:: ?
What right---right%1:07:00:: had John---person%1:03:00:: to any special consideration---consideration%1:07:00:: ?
Was John---person%1:03:00:: better , more deserving ?
To hell with John---person%1:03:00:: .
Let him chafe with impatience to see Charles---person%1:03:00:: , rip open the note---note%1:10:03:: with trembling hands---hand%1:08:00:: and read the formal report---report%1:10:03:: in Hillman---person%1:03:00:: 's beautiful , schoolmaster---schoolmaster%1:18:00:: 's hand---hand%1:10:00:: .
John---person%1:03:00:: would curse .
He believed that brave boys---boy%1:18:00:: did n't cry---cry%1:10:02:: .
Watson---person%1:03:00:: spat on the ground---ground%1:17:00:: .
He had stupidly thought himself compelled to ease his brother---brother%1:18:00:: 's pain---pain%1:12:00:: .
Now he knew perfectly that he had but longed to increase his own suffering---suffering%1:26:01:: .
Biological warfare---biological_warfare%1:04:00:: is the intentional use---use%1:04:00:: of living microorganisms---microorganism%1:05:00:: or their toxic products---product%1:06:00:: for the purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of destroying or reducing the military effectiveness---effectiveness%1:07:01:: of man---man%1:05:01:: .
It is the exploitation---exploitation%1:04:01:: of the inherent potential---potential%1:26:00:: of infectious disease---infectious_disease%1:26:00:: agents---agent%1:17:00:: by scientific research---research%1:04:00:: and development---development%1:04:01:: , resulting in the production---production%1:04:00:: of BW---bw%1:04:00:: weapons systems---weapons_system%1:06:00:: .
Man---man%1:05:01:: may also be injured secondarily by damage---damage%1:11:00:: to his food---food%1:03:00:: crops---crop%1:20:00:: or domestic animals---domestic_animal%1:05:00:: .
Biological warfare---biological_warfare%1:04:00:: is considered to be primarily a strategic weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: .
The major reason---reason%1:10:01:: for this is that it has no quick kill---kill%1:04:00:: effect---effect%1:19:00:: .
The incubation period---incubation_period%1:28:00:: of infectious disease---infectious_disease%1:26:00:: , plus a variable period---period%1:28:00:: of illness---illness%1:26:00:: even before a lethal effect---effect%1:19:00:: , render this weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter---encounter%1:04:00:: .
A man---man%1:05:01:: can be an effective fighting machine---machine%1:18:00:: throughout the incubation period---incubation_period%1:28:00:: of most infectious diseases---infectious_disease%1:26:00:: .
Thus , an enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: would probably use this weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: for attack---attack%1:04:00:: on static population---population%1:14:00:: centers---center%1:15:01:: such as large cities---city%1:15:00:: .
An important operational procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: in BW---bw%1:04:00:: for an enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: would be to create an aerosol---aerosol%1:19:00:: or cloud---cloud%1:19:01:: of agent---agent%1:17:00:: over the target area---target_area%1:15:00:: .
This concept---concept%1:09:00:: has stimulated much basic research---research%1:04:00:: concerning the behavior---behavior%1:26:00:: of particulate biological materials---material%1:27:00:: , the pathogenesis---pathogenesis%1:22:00:: of respiratory infections---infection%1:26:00:: , the medical management---management%1:04:00:: of such diseases---disease%1:26:00:: and defense---defense%1:04:03:: against their occurrence---occurrence%1:26:00:: .
The biological and physical properties---physical_property%1:07:00:: of infectious particles---particle%1:27:01:: have been studied intensively during the past fifteen years---year%1:28:01:: .
Much new equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: and many unique techniques---technique%1:09:01:: have been developed for the quantitative exposure---exposure%1:10:00:: of experimental animals---animal%1:03:00:: to aerosols---aerosol%1:19:00:: of infectious agents---agent%1:17:00:: contained in particles---particle%1:27:01:: of specified dimensional characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: .
Much information---information%1:09:00:: has been gathered relative to quantitative sampling---sampling%1:04:00:: and assessment---assessment%1:09:00:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: .
Much of the older experimental work---work%1:09:00:: on respiratory infections---infection%1:26:00:: was accomplished by very artificial procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: .
The intra nasal instillation---instillation%1:04:00:: of a fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: suspension---suspension%1:27:00:: of infectious agent---agent%1:17:00:: in an anesthetized animal---animal%1:03:00:: is far different from exposure---exposure%1:10:00:: , through natural respiration---respiration%1:04:00:: , to aerosolized organisms---organism%1:03:00:: .
The importance---importance%1:07:00:: of particle---particle%1:27:01:: size---size%1:07:00:: in such aerosols---aerosol%1:19:00:: has been thoroughly demonstrated .
The natural anatomical and physiological defensive features---feature%1:09:00:: of the upper respiratory tract---respiratory_tract%1:08:00:: , such as the turbinates---turbinate%1:08:00:: of the nose---nose%1:08:00:: and the cilia---cilium%1:05:00:: of the trachea---trachea%1:08:01:: and larger bronchi---bronchus%1:08:00:: , are capable of impinging---impinging%1:11:00:: out the larger particles---particle%1:27:01:: to which we are ordinarily exposed in our daily existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
Very small particles---particle%1:27:01:: , however , in a size---size%1:07:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: of 1 to 4 microns---micron%1:23:00:: in diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: are capable of passing these impinging---impinging%1:11:00:: barriers---barrier%1:06:00:: and entering the alveolar bed---alveolar_bed%1:08:00:: of the lungs---lung%1:08:00:: .
This area---area%1:08:00:: is highly susceptible to infection---infection%1:26:00:: .
The entrance---entrance%1:11:00:: and retention---retention%1:04:00:: of infectious particles---particle%1:27:01:: in the alveoli---alveolus%1:08:00:: amounts almost to an intra tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: inoculation---inoculation%1:04:00:: .
The relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: between particle---particle%1:27:01:: size---size%1:07:00:: and infectious dose---dose%1:23:00:: is illustrated in Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 .
In considering BW---bw%1:04:00:: defense---defense%1:04:03:: , it must be recognized that a number---number%1:07:00:: of critical meteorological parameters---parameter%1:09:00:: must be met for an aerosol---aerosol%1:19:00:: to exhibit optimum effect---effect%1:19:00:: .
In considering BW defense---defense%1:04:00:: , it must be recognized that a number of critical meteorological parameters must be met for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect .
For example , bright sunlight---sunlight%1:19:00:: is rapidly destructive for living microorganisms---microorganism%1:05:00:: suspended in air---air%1:27:00:: .
There are optimal humidity---humidity%1:26:00:: requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: for various agents---agent%1:17:00:: when airborne .
Neutral or inversion---inversion%1:19:00:: meteorological conditions---meteorological_conditions%1:26:00:: are necessary for a cloud---cloud%1:19:01:: to travel along the surface---surface%1:17:00:: .
It will rise during lapse---lapse%1:04:00:: conditions---condition%1:26:00:: .
There are , of course , certain times---time%1:11:00:: during the 24 - hour---hour%1:28:01:: daily cycle---cycle%1:28:00:: when most of these conditions---condition%1:26:00:: will be met .
Certain other properties---property%1:07:00:: of small particles---particle%1:27:01:: , in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration---penetration%1:04:02:: of the respiratory tract---respiratory_tract%1:08:00:: , are noteworthy in defense---defense%1:04:03:: considerations---consideration%1:09:00:: .
Certain other properties of small particles , in addition to those already mentioned in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract , are noteworthy in defense---defense%1:04:00:: considerations .
The smaller the particle---particle%1:27:01:: the further it will travel downwind before settling out .
An aerosol---aerosol%1:19:00:: of such small particles---particle%1:27:01:: .
moreover , diffuses through structures---structure%1:08:00:: in much the same manner---manner%1:07:02:: as a gas---gas%1:26:00:: .
There may be a number---number%1:07:00:: of secondary effects---effect%1:19:00:: resulting from diffusion---diffusion%1:22:00:: through buildings---building%1:06:00:: such as widespread contamination---contamination%1:26:00:: of kitchens---kitchen%1:06:00:: , restaurants---restaurant%1:06:00:: , food---food%1:03:00:: stores---store%1:06:00:: , hospitals---hospital%1:06:00:: , etc. .
Depending on the organism---organism%1:03:00:: , there may be multiplication---multiplication%1:04:01:: in some food---food%1:03:00:: or beverage---beverage%1:13:00:: products---product%1:06:00:: , i.e. , in milk---milk%1:13:01:: for example .
The secondary consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: in planning---planning%1:04:00:: for defense---defense%1:04:03:: .
The secondary consequences from this could be very serious and must be taken into consideration in planning for defense---defense%1:04:00:: .
Something of the behavior---behavior%1:26:00:: of clouds---cloud%1:19:01:: of small particles---particle%1:27:01:: can be illustrated by the following field trials---field_trial%1:09:00:: :
In the first trial---trial%1:04:00:: an inert substance---substance%1:03:00:: was disseminated from a boat---boat%1:06:00:: travelling some ten miles---mile%1:23:04:: off shore---shore%1:17:00:: under appropriately selected meteorological conditions---meteorological_conditions%1:26:00:: .
Zinc cadmium sulfide---zinc_cadmium_sulfide%1:27:00:: in particles---particle%1:27:01:: of 2 microns---micron%1:23:00:: in size---size%1:07:00:: were disseminated .
This material---material%1:27:00:: fluoresces under ultraviolet light---ultraviolet_light%1:19:00:: which facilitates its sampling---sampling%1:04:00:: and assessment---assessment%1:09:00:: .
Four hundred---four_hundred%1:14:00:: and fifty pounds---pound%1:23:09:: was disseminated while the ship---ship%1:06:00:: was traveling a distance---distance%1:07:00:: of 156 miles---mile%1:23:04:: .
Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 1 describes the results---result%1:19:00:: obtained in this trial---trial%1:04:00:: .
The particles---particle%1:27:01:: traveled a maximum detected distance---distance%1:07:00:: of some 450 miles---mile%1:23:01:: .
From these dosage---dosage%1:23:00:: isopleths---isopleth%1:15:00:: it can be seen that an area---area%1:15:01:: of over 34000 square miles---square_mile%1:23:00:: was covered .
These dosages---dosage%1:23:00:: could have been increased by increasing the source---source%1:15:00:: strength---strength%1:07:00:: which was small in this case---case%1:26:00:: .
The behavior---behavior%1:26:00:: of a biological aerosol---aerosol%1:19:00:: , on a much smaller scale---scale%1:24:00:: , is illustrated by a specific field trial---field_trial%1:09:00:: conducted with a non pathogenic organism---organism%1:03:00:: .
An aqueous suspension---suspension%1:27:00:: of the spores---spore%1:20:00:: of B.---b%1:05:00:: subtilis , var.---var.%1:14:00:: niger , generally known as Bacillus globigii , was aerosolized using commercially available nozzles---nozzle%1:06:00:: .
A satisfactory cloud---cloud%1:19:01:: was produced even though these nozzles---nozzle%1:06:00:: were only about 5 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: efficient in producing an initial cloud---cloud%1:19:01:: in the size---size%1:07:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: of 1 to 5 microns---micron%1:23:00:: .
In this test---test%1:09:02:: , 130 gallons---gallon%1:23:01:: of a suspension---suspension%1:27:00:: , having a count---count%1:23:00:: of * * f organisms---organism%1:03:00:: per ml---ml%1:23:00:: , or a total---total%1:06:00:: of approximately * * f spores---spore%1:20:00:: , was aerosolized .
The spraying---spraying%1:04:03:: operation---operation%1:04:02:: was conducted from the rear deck---deck%1:06:00:: of a small Naval vessel---vessel%1:06:00:: , cruising two---two%1:23:00:: miles---mile%1:23:04:: off-shore and vertical to an on-shore breeze---breeze%1:19:00:: .
Spraying---spraying%1:04:03:: continued along a two---two%1:23:00:: mile---mile%1:23:04:: course---course%1:15:00:: .
This operation---operation%1:04:02:: was started at 5 : 00 p.m. and lasted for 29 minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
There was a slight lapse---lapse%1:04:00:: condition---condition%1:26:00:: , a moderate fog---fog%1:19:00:: , and 100 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: relative humidity---relative_humidity%1:24:00:: .
A network---network%1:06:00:: of sampling stations---sampling_station%1:06:00:: had been set up on shore---shore%1:17:00:: .
These were located at the homes---home%1:15:04:: of Government---government%1:14:00:: employees---employee%1:18:00:: , in Government Offices---government_office%1:06:00:: , buildings---building%1:06:00:: and reservations---reservation%1:15:00:: within the trial---trial%1:09:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: .
A rough attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: was made to characterize the vertical profile---profile%1:15:01:: of the cloud---cloud%1:19:01:: by taking samples---sample%1:09:00:: from outside the windows---window%1:06:00:: on the first , ninth , and fifteenth floors---floor%1:06:01:: of a Government office---government_office%1:06:00:: building---building%1:06:00:: .
All samplers---sampler%1:06:01:: were operated for a period---period%1:28:00:: of two hours---hour%1:28:00:: except one---one%1:23:00:: , which was operated for four hours---hour%1:28:00:: .
In this instance---instance%1:11:00:: , there was a dosage---dosage%1:23:00:: of 562 during the first two hours---hour%1:28:00:: and a total---total%1:06:00:: dosage---dosage%1:23:00:: of 1980 for the four hour---hour%1:28:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: , a four-fold increase---increase%1:07:00:: .
This suggests that the sampling---sampling%1:04:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: , particularly at the more distant locations---location%1:03:00:: , should have been increased .
As can be seen from Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 , an extensive area---area%1:15:01:: was covered by this aerosol---aerosol%1:19:00:: .
The maximum distance---distance%1:07:00:: sampled was 23 miles---mile%1:23:01:: from the source---source%1:15:00:: .
As can be seen from these dosage---dosage%1:23:00:: isopleths---isopleth%1:15:00:: , approximately 100 square miles---square_mile%1:23:00:: was covered within the area---area%1:15:01:: sampled .
It is quite likely that an even greater area---area%1:15:01:: was covered , particularly downwind .
The dosages---dosage%1:23:00:: in the three levels---level%1:26:01:: of the vertical profile---profile%1:15:01:: were : * * f This was not , of course , enough sampling to give a satisfactory description---description%1:10:01:: of the vertical diffusion---diffusion%1:22:00:: of the aerosol---aerosol%1:19:00:: .
A number---number%1:07:00:: of unique medical problems---problem%1:26:00:: might be created when man---man%1:05:01:: is exposed to an infectious agent---agent%1:17:00:: through the respiratory route---route%1:15:00:: rather than by the natural portal---portal%1:06:01:: of entry---entry%1:06:00:: .
Some agents---agent%1:17:00:: have been shown to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animals---animal%1:03:00:: when exposed to aerosols---aerosol%1:19:00:: of optimum particle---particle%1:27:01:: size---size%1:07:00:: than by the natural portal---portal%1:06:01:: .
Botulinal toxin---toxin%1:27:00:: , for example , is several thousand-fold more toxic by this route---route%1:15:00:: than when given per os---os%1:08:01:: .
In some instances---instance%1:11:00:: a different clinical disease---disease%1:26:00:: picture---picture%1:06:00:: may result from this route---route%1:15:00:: of exposure---exposure%1:07:00:: , making diagnosis---diagnosis%1:04:00:: difficult .
In tularemia---tularemia%1:26:00:: produced by aerosol---aerosol%1:19:00:: exposure---exposure%1:07:00:: , one would not expect to find the classical ulcer---ulcer%1:26:00:: of `` rabbit fever---rabbit_fever%1:26:00:: '' on a finger---finger%1:08:00:: .
An enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: would obviously choose an agent---agent%1:17:00:: that is believed to be highly infectious .
Agents---agent%1:27:00:: that are known to cause frequent infections---infection%1:26:00:: among laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: workers---worker%1:18:00:: such as those causing Q fever---q_fever%1:26:00:: , tularemia---tularemia%1:26:00:: , brucellosis---brucellosis%1:26:01:: , glanders---glanders%1:26:00:: , coccidioidomycosis---coccidioidomycosis%1:26:00:: , etc. , belong in this category---category%1:14:00:: .
An agent---agent%1:17:00:: would likely be selected which would possess sufficient viability---viability%1:07:00:: and virulence---virulence%1:07:00:: stability---stability%1:07:00:: to meet realistic minimal logistic requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: .
It is , obviously , a proper goal---goal%1:09:00:: of research---research%1:04:00:: to improve on this property---property%1:07:00:: .
In this connection---connection%1:24:00:: it should be capable of being disseminated without excessive destruction---destruction%1:04:00:: .
Moreover , it should not be so fastidious in its growth---growth%1:22:00:: requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: as to make production---production%1:04:00:: on a militarily significant scale---scale%1:24:00:: improbable .
An aggressor---aggressor%1:18:00:: would use an agent---agent%1:17:00:: against which there was a minimal naturally acquired or artificially induced immunity---immunity%1:26:00:: in a target---target%1:15:00:: population---population%1:14:00:: .
A solid immunity---immunity%1:26:00:: is the one effective circumstance---circumstance%1:26:01:: whereby attack---attack%1:04:00:: by a specific agent---agent%1:17:00:: can be neutralized .
It must be remembered , however , that there are many agents---agent%1:17:00:: for which there is no solid immunity---immunity%1:26:00:: and a partial or low-grade immunity---immunity%1:26:00:: may be broken by an appropriate dose---dose%1:23:00:: of agent---agent%1:17:00:: .
There is a broad spectrum---spectrum%1:07:00:: of organisms---organism%1:03:00:: from which selection---selection%1:04:00:: for a specified military purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: might be made .
An enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: might choose an acutely debilitating microorganism---microorganism%1:05:00:: , a chronic disease---disease%1:26:00:: producer---producer%1:11:00:: or one causing a high rate---rate%1:28:00:: of lethality---lethality%1:07:00:: .
It is possible that certain mutational forms---form%1:14:02:: may be produced such as antibiotic resistant strains---strain%1:14:00:: .
Mutants---mutant%1:18:00:: may also be developed with changes---change%1:24:00:: in biochemical properties---property%1:07:00:: that are of importance---importance%1:07:00:: in identification---identification%1:04:00:: .
All of these considerations---consideration%1:09:01:: are of critical importance---importance%1:07:00:: in considering defense---defense%1:04:03:: and medical management---management%1:04:00:: .
Biological agents---agent%1:17:00:: are , of course , highly host---host%1:05:00:: specific .
They do not destroy physical structures---physical_structure%1:08:00:: as is true of high explosives---high_explosive%1:27:00:: .
This may be of overriding importance---importance%1:07:00:: in considering military objectives---objective%1:09:00:: .
The question---question%1:10:01:: of epidemic disease---disease%1:26:00:: merits some discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: .
Only a limited effort---effort%1:04:00:: has been devoted to this problem---problem%1:10:00:: .
Some of those who question the value---value%1:07:00:: of BW---bw%1:04:00:: have assumed that the only potential---potential%1:26:00:: would be in the establishment---establishment%1:04:00:: of epidemics---epidemic%1:11:00:: .
They then point out that with our present lack---lack%1:26:00:: of knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of all the factors---factor%1:11:00:: concerned in the rise---rise%1:11:00:: and fall---fall%1:11:01:: of epidemics---epidemic%1:11:00:: , it is unlikely that a planned episode---episode%1:11:00:: could be initiated .
They argue further ( and somewhat contradictorily ) that our knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: and resources---resource%1:09:00:: in preventive medicine---preventive_medicine%1:04:00:: would make it possible to control such an outbreak---outbreak%1:11:00:: of disease---disease%1:26:00:: .
this is why this approach---approach%1:04:02:: to BW---bw%1:04:00:: defense---defense%1:04:03:: has not been given major attention---attention%1:09:00:: .
this is why this approach to BW defense---defense%1:04:00:: has not been given major attention .
Our major problem---problem%1:10:00:: is what an enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: might accomplish in an initial attack---attack%1:04:00:: on a target---target%1:15:00:: .
This , of course , does not eliminate from consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: for this purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: agents---agent%1:17:00:: that are associated naturally with epidemic disease---disease%1:26:00:: .
A hypothetical example---example%1:09:02:: will illustrate this point---point%1:10:01:: .
Let us assume that it would be possible for an enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: to create an aerosol---aerosol%1:19:00:: of the causative agent---agent%1:17:00:: of epidemic typhus---typhus%1:26:00:: ( Rickettsia prowazwki ) over City---city%1:15:00:: A and that a large number---large_number%1:23:00:: of cases---case%1:11:00:: of typhus fever---typhus_fever%1:26:00:: resulted therefrom .
No epidemic---epidemic%1:11:00:: was initiated nor was one expected because the population---population%1:14:00:: in City---city%1:15:00:: A was not lousy .
Lousiness---lousiness%1:26:00:: is a prerequisite---prerequisite%1:09:00:: for epidemic typhus---typhus%1:26:00:: .
In this case---case%1:11:00:: , then , the military objective---objective%1:09:00:: was accomplished with an epidemic agent---agent%1:17:00:: solely through the results---result%1:19:00:: secured in the initial attack---attack%1:04:00:: .
This was done with full knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: that there would be no epidemic---epidemic%1:11:00:: .
On the other hand , a similar attack---attack%1:04:00:: might have been made on City B---location%1:03:00:: whose population---population%1:14:00:: was known to be lousy .
One might expect some spread---spread%1:11:00:: of the disease---disease%1:26:00:: in this case---case%1:11:00:: resulting in increased effectiveness---effectiveness%1:07:00:: of the attack---attack%1:04:00:: .
The major defensive problems---problem%1:10:00:: are concerned with the possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: of overt military delivery---delivery%1:04:04:: of biological agents---agent%1:17:00:: from appropriate disseminating devices---device%1:06:00:: .
It should be no more difficult to deliver such devices---device%1:06:00:: than other weapons---weapon%1:06:00:: .
The same delivery---delivery%1:04:04:: vehicles---vehicle%1:06:00:: - whether they be airplanes---airplane%1:06:00:: , submarines---submarine%1:06:00:: or guided missiles---guided_missile%1:06:00:: - should be usable .
If it is possible for an enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: to put an atomic bomb---atomic_bomb%1:06:00:: on a city---city%1:15:00:: , it should be equally possible to put a cloud---cloud%1:19:01:: of biological agent---agent%1:17:00:: over that city---city%1:15:00:: .
Biological agents are , moreover , suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which imposes many problems in defense---defense%1:04:00:: .
Biological agents---agent%1:17:00:: are , moreover , suitable for delivery---delivery%1:04:04:: through enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: sabotage---sabotage%1:04:00:: which imposes many problems---problem%1:26:00:: in defense---defense%1:04:03:: .
A few obvious target areas---target_area%1:15:00:: of great importance---importance%1:07:00:: might be mentioned .
The air conditioning and ventilating systems---ventilating_system%1:06:00:: of large buildings---building%1:06:00:: are subject to attack---attack%1:04:00:: .
America---america%1:15:00:: is rapidly becoming a nation---nation%1:14:01:: that uses processed , precooked and even predigested foods---food%1:03:00:: .
This is an enormous industry---industry%1:04:00:: that is subject to sabotage---sabotage%1:04:00:: .
One must include the preparation---preparation%1:04:02:: of soft drinks---soft_drink%1:13:00:: and the processing---processing%1:22:00:: of milk---milk%1:13:01:: and milk---milk%1:13:01:: products---product%1:06:00:: .
Huge industries---industry%1:04:00:: are involved also in the production---production%1:04:00:: of biological products---product%1:06:00:: , drugs---drug%1:06:00:: and cosmetics which are liable to this type---type%1:09:00:: of attack---attack%1:04:00:: .
In the midwest---midwest%1:15:00:: , oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: ponds---pond%1:17:00:: are used extensively for the treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: of domestic sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: from suburban areas---area%1:15:01:: .
The high cost---cost%1:07:00:: of land---land%1:21:01:: and a few operational problems---problem%1:26:00:: resulting from excessive loadings---loading%1:06:01:: have created the need---need%1:26:00:: for a wastewater---wastewater%1:27:00:: treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: system---system%1:06:00:: with the operational characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: of the oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: but with the ability---ability%1:07:00:: to treat more organic matter---matter%1:03:00:: per unit---unit%1:23:00:: volume---volume%1:23:00:: .
Research---research%1:04:00:: at Fayette ,---location%1:03:00:: Missouri---missouri%1:15:00:: on oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: ponds---pond%1:17:00:: has shown that the BOD in the treated effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: varied from 30 to 53 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: with loadings---loading%1:06:01:: from 8 to 120 lb---lb%1:23:00:: BOD / day---day%1:28:00:: / acre---acre%1:23:00:: .
Since experience---experience%1:09:01:: indicates that effluents---effluent%1:27:00:: from oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: ponds---pond%1:17:00:: do not create major problems---problem%1:26:00:: at these BOD concentrations---concentration%1:07:02:: , the goal---goal%1:09:00:: for the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: quality---quality%1:09:00:: of the accelerated treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: system---system%1:06:00:: was the same as from conventional oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: ponds---pond%1:17:00:: .
Recent studies---study%1:10:00:: by Weston and Stack had indicated that a turbine aerator could be added to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer .
Recent studies---study%1:04:00:: by Weston---person%1:03:00:: and Stack---person%1:03:00:: had indicated that a turbine---turbine%1:06:00:: aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: could be added to an oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: to increase the rate---rate%1:28:00:: of oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: .
Their study---study%1:04:00:: showed that it was possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb---lb%1:23:00:: of oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: / hr---hr%1:28:00:: / hp---hp%1:23:00:: .
O'Connor---person%1:03:00:: and Eckenfelder---person%1:03:00:: discussed the use---use%1:04:00:: of aerated lagoons---lagoon%1:17:00:: for treating organic wastes---waste%1:27:00:: .
They indicated that a 4 - day---day%1:28:00:: retention---retention%1:04:00:: , aerated lagoon---lagoon%1:17:00:: would give 60 to 76 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: BOD reduction---reduction%1:22:00:: .
Later , Eckenfelder---person%1:03:00:: increased the efficiency---efficiency%1:24:00:: of treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: to between 75 and 85 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: in the summer---summer%1:28:00:: months---month%1:28:01:: .
It appeared from the limited information---information%1:10:00:: available that the aerated lagoon---lagoon%1:17:00:: might offer a satisfactory means---means%1:04:00:: of increasing the capacity---capacity%1:23:00:: of existing oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: ponds---pond%1:17:00:: as well as providing the same degree---degree%1:26:01:: of treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: in a smaller volume---volume%1:23:00:: .
With the development---development%1:22:02:: of the Red Bridge Subdivision---group%1:03:00:: south of Kansas City---kansas_city%1:15:00:: , Missouri---missouri%1:15:00:: , the developer---developer%1:18:00:: was faced with the problem---problem%1:26:00:: of providing adequate sewage disposal---sewage_disposal%1:04:00:: .
The sewage system---sewage_system%1:06:00:: from Kansas City---kansas_city%1:15:00:: was not expected to serve the Red Bridge---location%1:03:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: for several years---year%1:28:01:: .
This necessitated the construction---construction%1:04:00:: of temporary sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: facilities---facility%1:06:00:: with an expected life---life%1:28:00:: from 5 to 15 yrs.---yr%1:28:00:: .
For the initial development---development%1:04:02:: an oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: was constructed as shown in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 1---1%1:23:00:: .
The oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: has a surface area---surface_area%1:07:00:: of 4.77 acres---acre%1:23:00:: and a depth---depth%1:07:00:: of 4 ft---foot%1:23:00:: .
The pond---pond%1:17:00:: is currently serving 1230 persons---person%1:03:00:: or 260 persons---person%1:03:00:: per acre---acre%1:23:00:: .
In the summer---summer%1:28:00:: of 1960 the oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: became completely septic and emitted obnoxious odors---odor%1:07:00:: .
It was possible to maintain aerobic conditions---condition%1:26:00:: in the pond---pond%1:17:00:: by regular additions---addition%1:06:00:: of sodium nitrate---sodium_nitrate%1:27:00:: until the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: decreased and the algae---algae%1:05:00:: population---population%1:14:01:: changed from blue-green---blue-green_algae%1:05:00:: to green algae---green_algae%1:05:00:: .
The anaerobic conditions---condition%1:26:00:: in the existing oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: necessitated examination---examination%1:04:00:: of other methods---method%1:09:00:: for supplying additional oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: than by sodium nitrate---sodium_nitrate%1:27:00:: .
At the same time further expansion---expansion%1:04:00:: in the Red Bridge Subdivision---group%1:03:00:: required the construction---construction%1:04:00:: of additional sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: facilities---facility%1:06:00:: .
The large land areas---land_area%1:07:00:: required for oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: ponds---pond%1:17:00:: made this type---type%1:09:00:: of treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: financially unattractive to the developer---developer%1:18:00:: .
It was proposed that aerated lagoons---lagoon%1:17:00:: be used to eliminate the problem---problem%1:26:00:: at the existing oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: ponds---pond%1:17:00:: and to provide the necessary treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: for the additional development---development%1:04:02:: .
The lack---lack%1:26:00:: of adequate data---data%1:14:00:: on the aerated lagoon---lagoon%1:17:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: prompted the developer---developer%1:18:00:: to construct an aerated lagoon---lagoon%1:17:00:: pilot plant---plant%1:06:01:: to determine its feasibility---feasibility%1:07:00:: for treating domestic sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: .
The pilot plant---plant%1:06:01:: was a circular lagoon---lagoon%1:17:00:: 81 ft---foot%1:23:00:: in diam---diam%1:07:00:: at the surface---surface%1:15:00:: and 65 ft---foot%1:23:00:: in diam---diam%1:07:00:: at the bottom---bottom%1:15:00:: , 4 ft---foot%1:23:00:: below the surface---surface%1:15:00:: , with a volume---volume%1:23:00:: of 121000 gal---gal%1:23:00:: .
The side---side%1:15:00:: slopes---slope%1:17:00:: were coated with fiberglas---fiberglass%1:27:00:: matting---matting%1:06:00:: coated with asphalt---asphalt%1:27:02:: to prevent erosion---erosion%1:22:00:: .
The pilot lagoon---lagoon%1:17:00:: was located as shown in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 1---1%1:23:00:: to serve the area---area%1:15:01:: just south of the existing housing---housing%1:06:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: .
The major contributor---contributor%1:18:00:: was a shopping center---shopping_center%1:06:00:: with houses---house%1:06:00:: being added to the system---system%1:06:00:: as the subdivision---subdivision%1:15:00:: developed .
The pilot lagoon---lagoon%1:17:00:: was designed to handle the wastes---waste%1:27:00:: from 314 persons---person%1:03:00:: with a 4 - day---day%1:28:00:: aeration---aeration%1:22:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: .
Initially , the wastewater---wastewater%1:27:00:: would be entirely from the shopping center---shopping_center%1:06:00:: with the domestic sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: from the houses---house%1:06:00:: increasing over an 18 - month---month%1:28:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: .
This operation---operation%1:26:00:: would permit evaluation---evaluation%1:04:00:: of the pilot plant---plant%1:06:01:: , with a slowly increasing load---load%1:06:00:: , over a reasonable period of time---period_of_time%1:28:00:: .
The pilot plant---plant%1:06:01:: was equipped with a 3---3%1:23:00:: - hp---hp%1:23:00:: turbine---turbine%1:06:00:: aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: ( Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2---2%1:23:00:: ) .
The aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: had a variable speed---speed%1:28:00:: drive---drive%1:06:02:: to permit operation---operation%1:26:00:: through a range---range%1:07:00:: of speeds---speed%1:28:00:: .
The sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: flow---flow%1:28:00:: into the treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: plant---plant%1:06:01:: was metered and continuously recorded on 24 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: charts---chart%1:10:00:: .
The raw sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: was introduced directly under the turbine---turbine%1:06:00:: aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: to insure maximum mixing---mixing%1:04:00:: of the raw sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: with the aeration---aeration%1:22:00:: tank---tank%1:06:00:: contents---content%1:14:00:: .
The effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: was collected through two pipes---pipe%1:06:00:: and discharged to the Blue River through a surface---surface%1:15:00:: drainage ditch---drainage_ditch%1:06:00:: .
Composite---composite%1:09:00:: samples---sample%1:09:00:: were collected at weekly intervals---interval%1:28:00:: .
The long retention---retention%1:04:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: and the complete mixing---mixing%1:04:00:: concept---concept%1:09:00:: prevented rapid changes---change%1:11:00:: in either the mixed liquor---liquor%1:27:00:: or in the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: .
Weekly samples---sample%1:09:00:: would make any changes---change%1:19:00:: more readily discernible than daily samples---sample%1:09:00:: .
The composite---composite%1:09:00:: samples---sample%1:09:00:: were normally collected over a 6 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: , but an occasional 24 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: composite---composite%1:09:00:: was made .
Examination---examination%1:04:00:: of the operations---operation%1:26:00:: of the shopping center---shopping_center%1:06:00:: permitted correlation---correlation%1:24:00:: of the 6 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: composite---composite%1:09:00:: samples---sample%1:09:00:: with 24 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: operations---operation%1:26:00:: .
The data---data%1:14:00:: indicated that the organic load---load%1:06:00:: during the 6 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: composites---composite%1:09:00:: was essentially 50 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the 24 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: organic load---load%1:06:00:: .
Grab samples---grab_sample%1:09:00:: were collected from the existing oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: to determine its operating conditions---condition%1:26:00:: .
Efforts were made to take the grab samples---grab_sample%1:09:00:: at random periods---period%1:28:00:: so that the mass---mass%1:23:00:: of data---data%1:14:00:: could be treated as a 6 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: composite---composite%1:09:00:: sample---sample%1:09:01:: .
A single 24 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: composite---composite%1:09:00:: sample---sample%1:09:01:: indicated that the sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: flow---flow%1:28:00:: pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: and characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: were typical .
The BOD of the influent to the pilot plant---plant%1:06:01:: varied between 110 and 710 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: with an average---average%1:09:00:: of 350 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: .
This was equivalent to 240 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l BOD on a 24 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: basis---basis%1:24:00:: .
The BOD of the raw sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: was typical of domestic sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: from a subdivision---subdivision%1:15:00:: .
The BOD in the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: averaged 58 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: , a 76 - per cent---percent%1:24:00:: reduction---reduction%1:22:00:: over the 24 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: .
Examination---examination%1:04:00:: of the data---data%1:14:00:: in Table---table%1:14:00:: 1---1%1:23:00:: , shows that a few samples---sample%1:09:00:: contributed to raising the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: BOD .
The periods---period%1:28:00:: of high effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: BOD occurred during cold periods---period%1:28:00:: when operational problems---problem%1:26:00:: with the aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: resulted .
Ice---ice%1:27:00:: caused the aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: to overload , straining the drive---drive%1:06:02:: belts---belt%1:06:01:: .
The slippage---slippage%1:22:00:: of the drive---drive%1:06:02:: belts---belt%1:06:01:: caused the aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: to slow down and reduce oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: as well as the mixing---mixing%1:04:00:: of the raw sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: .
The organic loading---loading%1:06:01:: on the unit averaged 32 lb---lb%1:23:00:: of BOD / day---day%1:28:00:: or about 2 lb---lb%1:23:00:: BOD / day---day%1:28:00:: 1000 cu ft---cu_ft%1:23:00:: aeration---aeration%1:22:00:: capacity---capacity%1:23:00:: .
Needless to say , the organic load---load%1:06:00:: was very low on a volumetric basis---basis%1:24:00:: , but was 270 lb---lb%1:23:00:: BOD / day---day%1:28:00:: / acre---acre%1:23:00:: on a surface---surface%1:15:00:: loading---loading%1:06:01:: basis---basis%1:24:00:: .
It seems that the aerated lagoon---lagoon%1:17:00:: was a very heavily loaded oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: or a lightly loaded activated sludge---sludge%1:27:01:: system---system%1:06:00:: .
The flow rate---flow_rate%1:28:00:: remained relatively constant during the winter---winter%1:28:00:: months---month%1:28:01:: as shown in Table---table%1:14:00:: 1---1%1:23:00:: , .
With the spring---spring%1:28:00:: rains the flow---flow%1:28:00:: rose rapidly due to infiltration---infiltration%1:04:00:: in open sewers---sewer%1:06:00:: .
As construction---construction%1:04:00:: progresses , the volume---volume%1:23:00:: of storm---storm%1:26:00:: drainage---drainage%1:04:00:: will be sharply reduced .
The retention---retention%1:04:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: in the aerated lagoon---lagoon%1:17:00:: ranged from 9.8 to 2.6 days---day%1:28:00:: , averaging 6.4 days---day%1:28:00:: .
The large amount---amount%1:07:00:: of vegetable---vegetable%1:13:00:: grindings---grinding%1:17:00:: from the grocery store---grocery_store%1:06:00:: in the shopping center---shopping_center%1:06:00:: created a suspended solids---solid%1:27:04:: problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
The vegetables---vegetable%1:13:00:: were not readily metabolized by the bacteria---bacteria%1:05:00:: in the aeration---aeration%1:22:00:: unit and tended to float on the surface---surface%1:15:00:: .
A skimming---skimming%1:04:00:: device---device%1:06:00:: at the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: weir---weir%1:06:00:: prevented loss---loss%1:21:01:: of most of these light solids---solid%1:27:04:: .
The average volatile suspended solids---solid%1:27:04:: in the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: was 75 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: while MLSS averaged 170 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: volatile suspended solids---solid%1:27:04:: .
The average sludge---sludge%1:27:01:: age---age%1:07:00:: based on displacement---displacement%1:04:02:: of solids---solid%1:27:04:: was calculated to be 14.5 days---day%1:28:00:: .
The oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: uptake---uptake%1:04:00:: rate---rate%1:28:00:: in the mixed liquor---liquor%1:27:00:: averaged 0.8 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: / hr---hr%1:28:00:: during the first four months---month%1:28:01:: of this study---study%1:04:00:: .
Variations---variation%1:11:01:: in aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: speeds---speed%1:28:00:: during the latter two months---month%1:28:01:: of this study---study%1:04:00:: caused increased mixing---mixing%1:04:00:: and increased oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: demand---demand%1:04:00:: .
The increase---increase%1:11:00:: in oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: uptake---uptake%1:04:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: from 1.2 to 2.6 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: / hr---hr%1:28:00:: which followed an increase---increase%1:22:00:: in rotor---rotor%1:06:01:: speed---speed%1:28:00:: was believed to be related to resuspension---resuspension%1:27:00:: of solids---solid%1:27:04:: which had settled at the lower rotor---rotor%1:06:01:: speeds---speed%1:28:00:: .
It appeared that most of the mixed liquor---liquor%1:27:00:: suspended solids---solid%1:27:04:: were active microbial solids---solid%1:27:04:: with the heavier , less active solids---solid%1:27:04:: settling out .
The suspended solids---solid%1:27:04:: discharged in the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: were found to be the major source---source%1:15:00:: of the BOD .
Removal---removal%1:04:00:: of the suspended solids---solid%1:27:04:: by a membrane---membrane%1:06:00:: filter---filter%1:06:00:: yielded an average effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: containing only 20 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: BOD .
The BOD in the drainage ditch---drainage_ditch%1:06:00:: receiving the pilot plant---plant%1:06:01:: effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: averaged 12 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: .
This low BOD was due to removal---removal%1:04:00:: of the excess suspended solids---solid%1:27:04:: by sedimentation---sedimentation%1:19:00:: since the only dilution---dilution%1:27:00:: was surface---surface%1:15:00:: runoff---runoff%1:11:00:: which was very low during this study---study%1:04:00:: .
Routine microscopic examinations---examination%1:04:00:: were made of the mixed liquor---liquor%1:27:00:: as indicated by McKinney---person%1:03:00:: and Gram---person%1:03:00:: for the various types---type%1:09:00:: of protozoa---protozoa%1:05:00:: .
It was found that the aerated lagoon---lagoon%1:17:00:: was an activated sludge---sludge%1:27:01:: system---system%1:06:00:: rather than an oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: .
At no time---time%1:28:06:: were algae---algae%1:05:00:: found in the mixed liquor---liquor%1:27:00:: .
The bacteria---bacteria%1:05:00:: formed typical activated sludge---sludge%1:27:01:: floc---floc%1:27:00:: .
The floc---floc%1:27:00:: particles---particle%1:27:01:: were all small as the heavier floc---floc%1:27:00:: settled out .
Initially , the flagellated protozoa---flagellated_protozoan%1:05:00:: predominated , but they soon gave way to the free swimming ciliated protozoa---ciliated_protozoan%1:05:00:: .
As the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: decreased , the number---number%1:23:00:: of free swimming ciliated protozoa---ciliated_protozoan%1:05:00:: decreased .
Very little protozoa---protozoa%1:05:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: existed below 40 ` F---f%1:23:02:: .
When the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: reached 32 ` F---f%1:23:02:: all protozoan---protozoan%1:05:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: ceased ; but as the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: rose , the numbers---number%1:23:00:: of protozoa---protozoa%1:05:00:: increased rapidly .
Only once were stalked ciliates---ciliate%1:05:00:: found in the mixed liquor---liquor%1:27:00:: .
The predomination---predomination%1:26:00:: of free swimming ciliated protozoa---ciliated_protozoan%1:05:00:: is indicative of a high bacterial population---population%1:14:01:: .
One of the important aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of this study---study%1:04:00:: was to determine the oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: relationships---relationship%1:24:00:: of the mechanical aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: .
Routine determinations---determination%1:04:00:: were made for dissolved oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: in the mixed liquor---liquor%1:27:00:: and for oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: uptake---uptake%1:04:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: .
The data---data%1:14:00:: given in Table---table%1:14:00:: 2---2%1:23:00:: , show the routine operation---operation%1:26:00:: of the aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: .
The dissolved oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: in the aeration---aeration%1:22:00:: unit was consistently high until January---january%1:28:00:: 29 , 1961 .
An extended cold spell caused ice---ice%1:27:00:: to build up on the aerator---aerator%1:06:00:: which was mounted on a floating platform---platform%1:06:00:: and caused the entire platform---platform%1:06:00:: to sink lower in the water---water%1:27:00:: .
The added resistance---resistance%1:19:00:: to the rotor---rotor%1:06:01:: damaged the drive---drive%1:06:02:: belts---belt%1:06:01:: and reduced the oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: capacity---capacity%1:23:00:: .
It was approximately one month---month%1:28:00:: before the belt---belt%1:06:01:: problem---problem%1:26:00:: was noticed and corrected , but at no time---time%1:28:06:: was there a deficiency---deficiency%1:07:00:: of dissolved oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: .
A series---series%1:14:00:: of eight special tests---test%1:09:02:: were conducted at different rotor---rotor%1:06:01:: speeds---speed%1:28:00:: to determine the oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: rate---rate%1:28:00:: .
Five of the tests---test%1:09:02:: were conducted with a polyethylene---polyethylene%1:27:00:: cover---cover%1:06:02:: to simulate an ice---ice%1:27:00:: cover---cover%1:17:00:: .
The rate---rate%1:28:00:: of oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: at 1.0 - mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: dissolved oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: and 10 ` C---c%1:23:02:: for various rotor---rotor%1:06:01:: speeds---speed%1:28:00:: is given in Table---table%1:14:00:: 3---3%1:23:00:: , .
The maximum rate---rate%1:28:00:: of oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: at 1.0 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: dissolved oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: was calculated as 220 lb---lb%1:23:00:: / day---day%1:28:00:: at a maximum rate---rate%1:28:00:: of 9.3 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: / hr---hr%1:28:00:: .
The actual power---power%1:19:00:: requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: indicated 2 lb---lb%1:23:00:: oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: transfer / hr---hr%1:28:00:: / hp---hp%1:23:00:: .
The polyethylene---polyethylene%1:27:00:: cover---cover%1:06:02:: reduced the oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: rate---rate%1:28:00:: by 10 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: , indicating that the maximum oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: is at the rotor---rotor%1:06:01:: rather than through the surface---surface%1:15:00:: .
During this study---study%1:04:00:: septic conditions---condition%1:26:00:: developed in the oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: in the spring---spring%1:28:00:: when the ice---ice%1:27:00:: melted .
Shortly after this study---study%1:04:00:: ended septic conditions---condition%1:26:00:: resulted which required the addition---addition%1:06:00:: of sodium nitrate---sodium_nitrate%1:27:00:: .
The location---location%1:03:00:: of the oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: in a high value---value%1:07:00:: residential area---area%1:15:01:: makes odor---odor%1:07:00:: nuisances---nuisance%1:09:00:: a sensitive problem---problem%1:26:00:: for the developer---developer%1:18:00:: .
The organic concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: in the influent raw sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: ranged from 160 to 270 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: of BOD with an average of 230 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: .
The BOD data---data%1:14:00:: are given in Table---table%1:14:00:: 4---4%1:23:00:: , .
A single 24 - hr---hr%1:28:00:: composite---composite%1:09:00:: sample---sample%1:09:00:: had a BOD of 260 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: , indicating a typical domestic sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: .
The daily sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: volume---volume%1:23:00:: to the oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: pond---pond%1:17:00:: averaged 147000 gpd , giving a retention---retention%1:04:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: of 42 days---day%1:28:00:: .
The organic loading---loading%1:23:00:: on the pond---pond%1:17:00:: was slightly under 60 lb---lb%1:23:00:: BOD / day---day%1:28:00:: / acre---acre%1:23:00:: .
The effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: BOD averaged 34 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: , a little lower than that of the study---study%1:04:00:: at Fayette---location%1:03:00:: indicated for a loading---loading%1:23:00:: of 60 lb---lb%1:23:00:: BOD / day---day%1:28:00:: / acre---acre%1:23:00:: .
The BOD of the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: ranged from a minimum---minimum%1:23:00:: of 13 to a maximum of 47 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l---l%1:23:00:: .
Microscopic examination---examination%1:04:00:: of the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: showed that minimum---minimum%1:23:00:: BOD occurred when the algae---algae%1:05:00:: began to decrease with cold weather---cold_weather%1:19:00:: .
When the algae---algae%1:05:00:: began to build up again , the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: BOD rose .
During the two weeks---two_weeks%1:28:00:: when the algae---algae%1:05:00:: disappeared from the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: BOD 's in the effluent---effluent%1:27:00:: were 18 and 16 mg---mg%1:23:00:: / l .
Consider a simple , closed , plane curve---curve%1:25:00:: C which is a real analytic image---image%1:06:00:: of the unit---unit%1:09:00:: circle---circle%1:25:00:: , and which is given by **f .
These are real analytic periodic functions---function%1:24:00:: with period---period%1:28:00:: T .
In the following paper---paper%1:10:00:: it is shown that in a certain definite sense , exactly an odd number---number%1:23:00:: of squares---square%1:25:00:: can be inscribed in every such curve---curve%1:25:00:: which does not contain an infinite number---number%1:23:00:: of inscribed squares---square%1:25:00:: .
This theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: is similar to the theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: of Kakutani---person%1:03:00:: that there exists a circumscribing cube---cube%1:25:00:: around any closed , bounded convex set---set%1:14:02:: in **f .
The latter theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: has been generalized by Yamabe---person%1:03:00:: and Yujobo---person%1:03:00:: , and Cairns---person%1:03:00:: to show that in **f there are families---family%1:14:04:: of such cubes---cube%1:25:00:: .
Here , for the case---case%1:11:00:: of squares---square%1:25:00:: inscribed in plane curves---curve%1:25:00:: , we remove the restriction---restriction%1:09:00:: to convexity---convexity%1:07:00:: and give certain other results---result%1:10:00:: .
A square---square%1:25:00:: inscribed in a curve---curve%1:25:00:: C means a square---square%1:25:00:: with its four corner---corner%1:15:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: on the curve---curve%1:25:00:: , though it may not lie entirely in the interior---interior%1:15:01:: of C .
Indeed , the spiral---spiral%1:25:00:: **f , with the two endpoints---endpoint%1:15:00:: connected by a straight line---straight_line%1:25:00:: possesses only one inscribed square---square%1:25:00:: .
The square---square%1:25:00:: has one corner---corner%1:15:00:: point---point%1:09:00:: on the straight line---straight_line%1:25:00:: segment---segment%1:06:00:: , and does not lie entirely in the interior---interior%1:15:01:: .
On C , from the point---point%1:09:00:: P at **f to the point---point%1:09:00:: Q at **f , we construct the chord---chord%1:25:00:: , and upon the chord---chord%1:25:00:: as a side---side%1:15:01:: erect a square---square%1:25:00:: in such a way---way%1:07:01:: that as s approaches zero---zero%1:23:01:: the square---square%1:25:00:: is inside C .
As s increases we consider the two free corner---corner%1:15:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: of the square---square%1:25:00:: , **f and **f , adjacent to P and Q respectively .
As s approaches T the square---square%1:25:00:: will be outside C and therefore both **f and **f must cross C an odd number---number%1:23:00:: of times---time%1:11:00:: as s varies from zero---zero%1:23:02:: to T .
The points---point%1:09:00:: may also touch C without crossing .
We now have certain squares---square%1:25:00:: with three corners---corner%1:15:00:: on C .
For any such square---square%1:25:00:: the middle corner---corner%1:15:00:: of these will be called the vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: of the square---square%1:25:00:: and the corner---corner%1:15:00:: not on the curve---curve%1:25:00:: will be called the diagonal point---point%1:09:00:: of the square---square%1:25:00:: .
Each point---point%1:09:00:: on C , as a vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: , may possess a finite number---number%1:23:00:: of corresponding diagonal points---point%1:09:00:: by the above construction---construction%1:04:02:: .
To each paired vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: and diagonal point---point%1:09:00:: there corresponds a unique forward corner---corner%1:15:00:: point---point%1:09:00:: , i.e. , the corner---corner%1:15:00:: on C reached first by proceeding along C from the vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: in the direction---direction%1:09:00:: of increasing t .
If the vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: is at **f , and if the interior---interior%1:15:01:: of C is on the left as one moves in the direction---direction%1:09:00:: of increasing t , then every such corner---corner%1:15:00:: can be found from the curve---curve%1:25:00:: obtained by rotating C clockwise through 90 ` about the vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: .
The set---set%1:14:02:: of intersections---intersection%1:09:00:: of **f , the rotated curve---curve%1:25:00:: , with the original curve---curve%1:25:00:: C consists of just the set---set%1:14:02:: of forward corner---corner%1:15:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: on C corresponding to the vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: at **f , plus the vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: itself .
We note that two such curves---curve%1:25:00:: C and **f , cannot coincide at more than a finite number---number%1:23:00:: of points---point%1:09:00:: ; otherwise , being analytic , they would coincide at all points---point%1:09:00:: , which is impossible since they do not coincide near **f .
With each vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: we associate certain numerical values---value%1:09:00:: , namely the set---set%1:14:02:: of positive differences---difference%1:11:00:: in the parameter---parameter%1:09:00:: t between the vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: and its corresponding forward corner---corner%1:15:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: .
For the vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: at **f , these values---value%1:09:00:: will be denoted by **f .
The function---function%1:24:00:: f ( t ) defined in this way---way%1:07:01:: is multi valued .
We consider now the graph---graph%1:10:00:: of the function---function%1:24:00:: f ( t ) on **f .
We will refer to the plane---plane%1:25:00:: of C and **f as the C-plane and to the plane---plane%1:25:00:: of the graph---graph%1:10:00:: as the f-plane .
The graph---graph%1:10:00:: , as a set---set%1:14:02:: , may have a finite number---number%1:23:00:: of components---component%1:09:00:: .
We will denote the values---value%1:09:00:: of f ( t ) on different components---component%1:09:00:: by **f .
Each point---point%1:09:00:: with abscissa---abscissa%1:09:00:: t on the graph---graph%1:10:00:: represents an intersection---intersection%1:09:00:: between C and **f .
There are two types---type%1:09:00:: of such intersections---intersection%1:09:00:: , depending essentially on whether the curves---curve%1:25:00:: cross at the point of intersection---point_of_intersection%1:09:00:: .
An ordinary point---point%1:09:00:: will be any point of intersection---point_of_intersection%1:09:00:: A such that in every neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: of A in the C-plane , **f meets both the interior---interior%1:15:01:: and the exterior of C .
Any other point of intersection---point_of_intersection%1:09:00:: between C and **f will be called a tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: point---point%1:09:00:: .
This terminology---terminology%1:10:00:: will also be applied to the corresponding points---point%1:09:00:: in the f-plane .
We can now prove several lemmas---lemma%1:10:00:: .
In some neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: in the f-plane of any ordinary point---point%1:09:00:: of the graph---graph%1:10:00:: , the function---function%1:24:00:: f is a single valued , continuous function---function%1:24:00:: .
We first show that the function---function%1:24:00:: is single valued in some neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: .
With the vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: at **f in the C-plane we assume that **f is the parametric location---location%1:03:00:: on C of an ordinary intersection---intersection%1:09:00:: Q between C and **f .
In the f-plane the coordinates---coordinate%1:09:00:: of the corresponding point---point%1:09:00:: are **f .
In the C-plane we construct a set---set%1:14:02:: of rectangular Cartesian coordinates---coordinate%1:09:00:: u , v with the origin---origin%1:09:00:: at Q and such that both C and **f have finite slope---slope%1:07:00:: at Q .
Near Q , both curves---curve%1:25:00:: can be represented by analytic functions---function%1:24:00:: of u .
In a neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: of Q the difference between these functions---function%1:24:00:: is also a single valued , analytic function---function%1:24:00:: of u .
Furthermore , one can find a neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: of Q in which the difference function---function%1:24:00:: is monotone , for since it is analytic it can have only a finite number---number%1:23:00:: of extrema---extremum%1:15:00:: in any interval---interval%1:09:00:: .
Now , to find **f , one needs the intersection---intersection%1:09:00:: of C and **f near Q .
But **f is just the curve---curve%1:25:00:: **f translated without rotation---rotation%1:04:00:: through a small arc---arc%1:25:00:: , for **f is always obtained by rotating C through exactly 90 ` .
The arc---arc%1:25:00:: is itself a segment---segment%1:06:00:: of an analytic curve---curve%1:25:00:: .
Thus if e is sufficiently small , there can be only one intersection---intersection%1:09:00:: of C and **f near Q , for if there were more than one intersection---intersection%1:09:00:: for every e then the difference between C and **f near Q would not be a monotone function---function%1:24:00:: .
It is also seen that **f , since the change---change%1:11:00:: from **f to **f is accomplished by a continuous translation---translation%1:11:00:: .
Thus **f is also continuous at **f , and in a neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: of **f which does not contain a tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: point---point%1:09:00:: .
We turn now to the set---set%1:14:02:: of tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: on the graph---graph%1:10:00:: .
This set---set%1:14:02:: must consist of isolated points---point%1:09:00:: and closed intervals---closed_interval%1:09:00:: .
The fact---fact%1:09:01:: that there can not be any limit points of the set---set%1:14:02:: except in closed intervals---closed_interval%1:09:00:: follows from the argument---argument%1:10:02:: used in Lemma---lemma%1:10:00:: 1 , namely , that near any tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: point---point%1:09:00:: in the C-plane the curves---curve%1:25:00:: C and **f are analytic , and therefore the difference between them must be a monotone function---function%1:24:00:: in some neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: on either side---side%1:15:02:: of the tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: point---point%1:09:00:: .
This prevents the occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: of an infinite sequence---sequence%1:14:00:: of isolated tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: .
In some neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: of an isolated tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: point---point%1:09:00:: in the f-plane , say **f , the function---function%1:24:00:: **f is either double valued or has no values---value%1:09:00:: defined , except at the tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: point---point%1:09:00:: itself , where it is single valued .
A tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: point---point%1:09:00:: Q in the C-plane occurs when C and **f are tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: to one another .
A continuous change---change%1:11:00:: in t through an amount---amount%1:03:00:: e results in a translation---translation%1:11:00:: along an analytic arc---arc%1:25:00:: of the curve---curve%1:25:00:: **f .
There are three possibilities---possibility%1:26:00:: : ( a ) **f remains tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: to C as it is translated ; ( b ) **f moves away from C and does not intersect it at all for **f ; ( c ) **f cuts across C and there are two ordinary intersections---intersection%1:09:00:: for every t in **f .
The first possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: results in a closed interval---closed_interval%1:09:00:: of tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: in the f-plane , the end points---end_point%1:15:00:: of which fall into category---category%1:14:00:: ( b ) or ( c ) .
In the second category---category%1:14:00:: the function---function%1:24:00:: **f has no values---value%1:09:00:: defined in a neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: **f .
In the third category---category%1:14:00:: the function---function%1:24:00:: is double valued in this interval---interval%1:09:00:: .
The same remarks---remark%1:10:00:: apply to an interval---interval%1:09:00:: on the other side---side%1:15:02:: of **f .
Again , the analyticity---analyticity%1:07:00:: of the two---two%1:23:00:: curves---curve%1:25:00:: guarantee that such intervals---interval%1:09:00:: exist .
In the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: of an end point---end_point%1:15:00:: of an interval---interval%1:09:00:: of tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: in the f-plane the function---function%1:24:00:: is two valued or no valued on one side---side%1:15:02:: , and is a single valued function---function%1:24:00:: consisting entirely of tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: on the other side---side%1:15:01:: .
With the above results---result%1:10:00:: we can make the following remarks---remark%1:10:00:: about the graph---graph%1:10:00:: of f .
First , for any value---value%1:09:00:: of t for which all values---value%1:09:00:: of f ( t ) are ordinary points---point%1:09:00:: the number---number%1:23:00:: of values---value%1:09:00:: of f ( t ) must be odd .
For it is clear that the total number---number%1:23:00:: of ordinary intersections---intersection%1:09:00:: of C and **f must be even ( otherwise , starting in the interior---interior%1:15:01:: of C , **f could not finally return to the interior---interior%1:15:01:: ) , and the center---center%1:15:01:: of rotation---rotation%1:04:00:: at t is the argument---argument%1:10:02:: of the function---function%1:24:00:: , not a value---value%1:09:00:: .
Therefore , for any value---value%1:09:00:: of t the number---number%1:23:00:: of values---value%1:09:00:: of f ( t ) is equal to the ( finite ) number---number%1:23:00:: of tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: corresponding to the argument---argument%1:10:02:: t plus an odd number---number%1:23:00:: .
The number---number%1:23:00:: of ordinary values---value%1:09:00:: of the function---function%1:24:00:: f ( t ) at t will be called its multiplicity---multiplicity%1:07:02:: at t .
The graph---graph%1:10:00:: of f has at least one component---component%1:09:00:: whose support---support%1:04:02:: is the entire interval---interval%1:09:00:: [ 0---0%1:23:00:: , T ] .
Then every component---component%1:24:00:: of the graph---graph%1:10:00:: of f must be defined over a bounded sub-interval---sub-interval%1:09:00:: .
Suppose **f is defined in the sub-interval---sub-interval%1:09:00:: **f .
Now **f and **f must both be tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: on the nth component---component%1:24:00:: in the f-plane ; otherwise by Lemma---lemma%1:10:00:: 1 the component---component%1:24:00:: would extend beyond these points---point%1:09:00:: .
Further , we see by Lemma---lemma%1:10:00:: 2 that the multiplicity---multiplicity%1:07:02:: of f can only change at a tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: point---point%1:09:00:: , and at such a point---point%1:09:00:: can only change by an even integer---integer%1:23:00:: .
Thus the multiplicity---multiplicity%1:07:02:: of **f for a given t must be an even number---number%1:23:00:: .
This is true of all components---component%1:09:00:: which have such a bounded support---support%1:04:02:: .
But this is a contradiction---contradiction%1:10:01:: , for we know that the multiplicity---multiplicity%1:07:02:: of f ( t ) is odd for every t .
We have shown that the graph---graph%1:10:00:: of f contains at least one component---component%1:24:00:: whose inverse is the entire interval---interval%1:09:00:: [ 0---0%1:23:00:: , T ] , and whose multiplicity---multiplicity%1:07:02:: is odd .
There must be an odd number---number%1:23:00:: of such components---component%1:09:00:: , which will be called complete components---component%1:09:00:: .
The remaining ( incomplete ) components---component%1:09:00:: all have an even number---number%1:23:00:: of ordinary points---point%1:09:00:: at any argument---argument%1:10:02:: , and are defined only on a proper sub-interval---sub-interval%1:09:00:: of [ 0---0%1:23:00:: , T ] .
We must now show that on some component---component%1:24:00:: of the graph---graph%1:10:00:: there exist two points---point%1:09:00:: for which the corresponding diagonal points---point%1:09:00:: in the C-plane are on opposite sides---side%1:15:02:: of C .
We again consider a fixed point---point%1:09:00:: P at **f and a variable point---point%1:09:00:: Q at **f on C .
We erect a square---square%1:25:00:: with PQ as a side---side%1:15:01:: and with free corners---corner%1:15:00:: **f and **f adjacent to P and Q respectively .
As s varies from zero---zero%1:23:02:: to T , the values---value%1:09:00:: of s for which **f and **f cross C will be denoted by **f and **f respectively .
We have **f , plus tangent---tangent%1:25:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: .
These s-values are just the ordinary values---value%1:09:00:: of **f .
The values---value%1:09:00:: **f are the ordinary values---value%1:09:00:: at **f of a multi valued function---function%1:24:00:: g ( t ) which has components---component%1:09:00:: corresponding to those of f ( t ) .
We first define a function---function%1:24:00:: b ( t ) as follows : given the set---set%1:14:02:: of squares---square%1:25:00:: such that each has three corners---corner%1:15:00:: on C and vertex---vertex%1:09:00:: at t , b ( t ) is the corresponding set---set%1:14:02:: of positive parametric differences---difference%1:11:00:: between t and the backward corner---corner%1:15:00:: points---point%1:09:00:: .
The functions---function%1:24:00:: f and b have exactly the same multiplicity---multiplicity%1:07:02:: at every argument---argument%1:10:02:: t .
Now---now%1:28:00:: with P fixed at **f , **f-values occur when the corner---corner%1:15:00:: **f crosses C , and are among the values---value%1:09:00:: of s such that **f .
The roots---root%1:14:00:: of this equation---equation%1:10:00:: are just the ordinates---ordinate%1:09:00:: of the intersections---intersection%1:09:00:: of the graph---graph%1:10:00:: of b with a straight line---straight_line%1:25:00:: of unit---unit%1:09:00:: slope---slope%1:07:00:: through **f in the b-plane ( the plane---plane%1:25:00:: of the graph---graph%1:10:00:: of b ) .
We define these values---value%1:09:00:: as **f , and define g ( t ) in the same way---way%1:07:01:: for each t .
Thus we obtain g ( t ) by introducing an oblique g ( t ) - axis---axis%1:09:00:: in the b-plane .
The Poynting-Robertson---person%1:03:00:: effect---effect%1:19:00:: ( Robertson---person%1:03:00:: , 1937 ; Wyatt---person%1:03:00:: and Whipple---person%1:03:00:: , 1950 ) , which is a retardation---retardation%1:07:00:: of the orbital motion---motion%1:11:00:: of particles---particle%1:17:00:: by the relativistic aberration---aberration%1:26:01:: of the repulsive force---repulsive_force%1:19:00:: of the impinging---impinging%1:11:00:: solar radiation---solar_radiation%1:19:00:: , causes the dust---dust%1:27:01:: to spiral into the sun---sun%1:17:00:: in times---time%1:28:05:: much shorter than the age---age%1:07:00:: of the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: .
The radial velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: varies inversely as the particle---particle%1:17:00:: size---size%1:07:00:: - a 1000 - | m---m%1:23:00:: diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: particle---particle%1:17:00:: near the orbit---orbit%1:15:00:: of Mars---mars%1:17:00:: would reach the sun---sun%1:17:00:: in about 60 million---million%1:23:00:: years---year%1:28:01:: .
Whipple---person%1:03:00:: ( 1955 ) extends the effects---effect%1:19:00:: to include the solar---solar_radiation%1:19:00:: corpuscular radiation---corpuscular_radiation%1:19:00:: pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: , which increases both the minimum particle---particle%1:17:00:: size---size%1:07:00:: and the drag---drag%1:19:00:: .
Further , the corpuscular radiation---corpuscular_radiation%1:19:00:: , i.e. , the solar wind---solar_wind%1:19:00:: protons---proton%1:17:00:: , must sputter away the surface---surface%1:15:00:: atoms---atom%1:27:00:: of the dust---dust%1:27:01:: and cause a slow diminution---diminution%1:22:00:: in size---size%1:07:00:: , with a resultant increase---increase%1:11:00:: in both the Poynting-Robertson---person%1:03:00:: effect---effect%1:19:00:: and the ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: of the repulsive force---repulsive_force%1:19:00:: to the gravitational force---gravitational_force%1:19:00:: .
The Poynting-Robertson---person%1:03:00:: effect---effect%1:19:00:: causes the semi major axis---major_axis%1:09:00:: of orbits---orbit%1:15:00:: to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis---semiminor_axis%1:09:00:: , with a consequent tendency---tendency%1:07:00:: toward circular orbits---orbit%1:15:00:: as the particles---particle%1:17:00:: move toward the sun---sun%1:17:00:: .
Also , planetary gravitational attraction---gravitational_attraction%1:19:00:: increases the dust---dust%1:27:01:: concentration---concentration%1:07:03:: near the plane---plane%1:25:00:: of the ecliptic---ecliptic%1:15:00:: as the sun---sun%1:17:00:: is approached .
At one astronomical unit---astronomical_unit%1:23:00:: from the sun---sun%1:17:00:: ( the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: 's distance---distance%1:07:00:: ) the dust---dust%1:27:01:: orbits---orbit%1:15:00:: are probably nearly circular .
If such is the case---case%1:09:00:: , the particles---particle%1:17:00:: within a distance---distance%1:07:00:: of about * * f km---km%1:23:00:: of the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: will have , relative to the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: , a kinetic energy---kinetic_energy%1:19:00:: less than their potential energy---potential_energy%1:19:00:: and they will be captured into orbits---orbit%1:15:00:: about the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: .
De Jager---person%1:03:00:: ( 1955 ) has calculated the times---time%1:28:05:: required for these particles---particle%1:17:00:: to reach the atmosphere---atmosphere%1:15:00:: under the influence---influence%1:04:00:: of the Poynting-Robertson---person%1:03:00:: effect---effect%1:19:00:: , which in this case---case%1:26:00:: causes the orbits---orbit%1:15:00:: to become more and more eccentric without changing the semi major axis---major_axis%1:09:00:: .
This effect---effect%1:19:00:: can give rise to a blanket---blanket%1:17:00:: of micrometeorites---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: around the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: .
Since there is a continual loss---loss%1:21:01:: of micrometeoritic material---material%1:27:00:: in space---space%1:15:01:: because of the radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: effects---effect%1:19:00:: , there must be a continual replenishment---replenishment%1:22:00:: : otherwise , micrometeorites---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: would have disappeared from interplanetary space---interplanetary_space%1:15:00:: .
There are several possible sources---source%1:15:00:: .
According to Whipple---person%1:03:00:: ( 1955 ) , cometary debris---debris%1:27:00:: is sufficient to replenish the material---material%1:27:00:: spiraling into the sun---sun%1:17:00:: , maintaining a fairly steady state---state%1:03:00:: .
Asteroidal collisions---collision%1:11:01:: are also thought to contribute material---material%1:27:00:: .
It is also possible that some of the dust---dust%1:27:01:: in the vicinity---vicinity%1:15:00:: of the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: originated from meteoritic impacts---impact%1:11:00:: upon the moon---moon%1:17:01:: .
One cannot make a very satisfactory guess---guess%1:09:00:: about the micrometeorite---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: flux---flux%1:28:00:: in space---space%1:15:01:: .
Even in the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: of the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: , where information---information%1:09:00:: has been obtained both directly and indirectly , the derived flux---flux%1:28:00:: values---value%1:09:00:: vary by at least four orders of magnitude---order_of_magnitude%1:07:00:: .
This large discrepancy---discrepancy%1:07:00:: demonstrates the inadequacies---inadequacy%1:07:01:: of the experimental methods---method%1:09:00:: and the lack---lack%1:26:00:: of understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of the various phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: involved .
Beyond a few million---million%1:23:00:: kilometers---kilometer%1:23:00:: from the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: , but still in the region---region%1:15:00:: of the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: 's orbit---orbit%1:15:00:: , a prediction---prediction%1:09:00:: of the flux---flux%1:28:00:: of dust---dust%1:27:01:: is even more unreliable .
At greater distances---distance%1:07:00:: from the sun---sun%1:17:00:: , the situation---situation%1:26:00:: is still less certain .
There are several sources---source%1:15:00:: of evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: on the micrometeorite---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: environment---environment%1:26:00:: .
Direct information---information%1:09:00:: has been obtained from rockets---rocket%1:06:00:: and satellites---satellite%1:06:00:: equipped with impact---impact%1:11:00:: sensors---sensor%1:06:00:: .
In addition , the size---size%1:07:00:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: obtained from visual and radar---radar%1:06:00:: observations---observation%1:04:01:: of meteors---meteor%1:17:00:: may be extrapolated to the micrometeorite---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: domain---domain%1:26:00:: .
From the brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: of the F component---component%1:06:00:: of the solar corona---corona%1:19:00:: and the brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: of the zodiacal light---zodiacal_light%1:19:00:: , an estimate---estimate%1:09:00:: of the particle---particle%1:17:00:: sizes---size%1:07:00:: , concentrations---concentration%1:07:03:: , and spatial distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: can be derived for regions---region%1:15:00:: of space---space%1:15:01:: near the ecliptic---ecliptic%1:15:00:: plane---plane%1:25:00:: .
Another important source---source%1:15:00:: of evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: only recently receiving much attention---attention%1:09:00:: is the analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of atmospheric dust---dust%1:27:01:: for a meteoritic component---component%1:06:00:: .
The cores---core%1:17:01:: of deep sea---sea%1:17:00:: sediments---sediment%1:17:00:: and content---content%1:14:00:: of collectors---collector%1:17:00:: in remote regions---region%1:15:01:: are valuable in this category---category%1:14:00:: .
The data---data%1:14:00:: provide a measure of the total mass---mass%1:07:00:: of cosmic material---material%1:27:00:: incident upon the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: .
The direct evidence---direct_evidence%1:10:00:: on the micrometeorite---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: environment---environment%1:26:00:: near the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: is obtained from piezoelectric sensors---sensor%1:06:00:: ( essentially microphones---microphone%1:06:00:: ) and from wire---wire%1:06:00:: gages---gage%1:06:00:: ; these instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: are installed on rockets---rocket%1:06:00:: , satellites---satellite%1:06:00:: , and space probes---space_probe%1:06:00:: .
Statistically , the most significant data---data%1:14:00:: have been collected from the sensors---sensor%1:06:00:: on 1958 Alpha ( Explorer 1 , ) , 1958 Delta 2 ( Sputnik---sputnik%1:06:00:: 3 , ) , and 1959 Eta ( Vanguard 3 , ) .
These vehicles---vehicle%1:06:00:: , with large sensitive areas---area%1:06:00:: , have collected data---data%1:14:00:: for long enough times---time%1:28:05:: to give reliable impact---impact%1:11:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: for the periods---period%1:28:00:: of exposure---exposure%1:07:00:: .
Many other vehicles---vehicle%1:06:00:: with smaller sensitive area---area%1:06:00:: exposure---exposure%1:07:00:: time---time%1:28:05:: products---product%1:06:00:: contribute some information---information%1:09:00:: .
The impact---impact%1:11:00:: rate---rate%1:28:00:: on 1958 Alpha for 153 events---event%1:03:00:: was * * f for particles---particle%1:17:00:: of mass---mass%1:07:00:: greater than * * f ( Dubin---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ) ; this mass---mass%1:07:00:: threshold---threshold%1:28:00:: was derived from the detector---detector%1:06:00:: calibration---calibration%1:04:00:: and an assumed impact---impact%1:11:00:: velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: of * * f .
The data---data%1:14:00:: show daily---daily_variation%1:11:00:: and diurnal variations---diurnal_variation%1:11:00:: .
Ninety per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the 153 recorded impacts---impact%1:11:00:: occurred between midnight---midnight%1:28:00:: and noon---noon%1:28:00:: , and from day---day%1:28:00:: to day---day%1:28:00:: the variation---variation%1:11:01:: of the rate---rate%1:28:00:: was as much as an order of magnitude---order_of_magnitude%1:07:00:: .
One may conclude that most of the detected micrometeoritic material---material%1:27:00:: is concentrated in orbital streams---stream%1:04:00:: which intersect the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: 's orbit---orbit%1:15:00:: .
There have been contradictory reports---report%1:10:03:: from 1958 Delta 2 , and the data---data%1:14:00:: quoted here are believed to be the more reliable .
On May---may%1:28:00:: 15 , a very large increase---increase%1:11:00:: occurred with * * f of mass---mass%1:07:00:: between * * f and * * f ; for the next two days---day%1:28:00:: , the impact---impact%1:11:00:: rate---rate%1:28:00:: was * * f ; and for the next nine days---day%1:28:00:: , the impact---impact%1:11:00:: rate---rate%1:28:00:: was less than * * f ( Nazarova---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ) .
The data---data%1:14:00:: for the first day---day%1:28:00:: indicate a meteor stream---meteor_stream%1:19:00:: with a very high concentration---concentration%1:07:03:: of particles---particle%1:17:00:: and may have led to the high estimates---estimate%1:09:00:: of micrometeorite---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: flux---flux%1:28:00:: .
Preliminary data---data%1:14:00:: from 1959 Eta give an average impact---impact%1:11:00:: rate---rate%1:28:00:: of * * f for masses---mass%1:07:00:: larger than * * f for about 1000 events---event%1:03:00:: in a 22 - day---day%1:28:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: ( LaGow---person%1:03:00:: and Alexander---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ) .
The day-to-day rate---rate%1:28:00:: varied by less than a factor---factor%1:23:00:: of 4.5 .
The data---data%1:14:00:: have not yet been analyzed for diurnal variations---diurnal_variation%1:11:00:: .
Note that the mass---mass%1:07:00:: threshold---threshold%1:28:00:: is four times that of 1958 Alpha and that the flux---flux%1:28:00:: is one fifth---one-fifth%1:23:00:: as large .
If one assumes that the average flux---flux%1:28:00:: did not change between measurements , a mass---mass%1:07:00:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: curve---curve%1:10:00:: is obtained which relates the flux---flux%1:28:00:: of particles---particle%1:17:00:: larger than a given radius---radius%1:07:00:: to the inverse 7 2 power---power%1:10:00:: of the radius---radius%1:07:00:: .
Space probes---space_probe%1:06:00:: have yielded little information---information%1:09:00:: .
Pioneer 1 , recorded a decrease---decrease%1:11:00:: in flux---flux%1:28:00:: with distance---distance%1:07:00:: from the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of 11 counts---count%1:04:00:: in 9 hours---hour%1:28:00:: .
With detectors---detector%1:06:00:: sensitive to three mass---mass%1:07:00:: intervals---interval%1:09:00:: and based on a few counts---count%1:04:00:: , the second and third Russian space probes---space_probe%1:06:00:: indicate that the flux---flux%1:28:00:: of the smallest particles---particle%1:17:00:: detected is less than that of larger ones .
Being based on so few events---event%1:03:00:: , these results---result%1:19:00:: are of dubious validity---validity%1:07:01:: .
The calibration---calibration%1:04:00:: of piezoelectric sensors---sensor%1:06:00:: in terms of the particle---particle%1:17:00:: parameters---parameter%1:11:00:: is very uncertain .
Many workers---worker%1:18:00:: believe that the response---response%1:19:00:: is proportional to the incident momentum---momentum%1:07:01:: of the particles---particle%1:17:00:: , a relation---relation%1:03:00:: deduced from laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: results---result%1:19:00:: linearly extrapolated to meteoritic velocities---velocity%1:28:00:: .
However , one must expect that vaporization---vaporization%1:04:00:: and ejection---ejection%1:04:01:: of material---material%1:27:00:: by hypervelocity---hypervelocity%1:28:00:: impacts---impact%1:11:00:: would cause a deviation---deviation%1:11:00:: from a linear relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: .
In the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: , most of the sensors---sensor%1:06:00:: are calibrated by dropping small spheres---sphere%1:06:00:: on their sensitive surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: .
The Russian experimenters---experimenter%1:18:00:: claim that only a small fraction---fraction%1:06:00:: of the impulse---impulse%1:04:01:: from the sensors---sensor%1:06:00:: is caused by the incident momentum---momentum%1:07:00:: with the remainder---remainder%1:24:00:: being momentum---momentum%1:07:00:: of ejected material---material%1:27:00:: from the sensor---sensor%1:06:00:: .
This `` ejection---ejection%1:04:01:: '' momentum---momentum%1:07:00:: is linearly related to the particle---particle%1:17:00:: energy---energy%1:19:00:: .
They quote about the same mass---mass%1:07:00:: threshold---threshold%1:28:00:: as that of the U.S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: , but a momentum---momentum%1:07:00:: threshold---threshold%1:28:00:: about 40 times greater .
There is a difference---difference%1:07:00:: in the experimental arrangement , in that the U.S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: microphones---microphone%1:06:00:: are attached directly to the vehicle---vehicle%1:06:00:: skin---skin%1:06:01:: while the Russian instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: are isolated from the skin---skin%1:06:01:: .
The threshold---threshold%1:28:00:: mass---mass%1:07:00:: is derived from the momentum---momentum%1:07:00:: threshold---threshold%1:28:00:: with the assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: of a mean---mean%1:09:00:: impact---impact%1:11:00:: velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: of * * f in the U.S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: work---work%1:06:00:: and * * f in the U.S.S.R.---ussr%1:15:00:: work---work%1:06:00:: .
The threshold---threshold%1:28:00:: mass---mass%1:07:00:: of about * * f corresponds to a 10 - | m---m%1:23:00:: diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: sphere---sphere%1:26:00:: of density---density%1:07:00:: * * f .
However , the conversion---conversion%1:09:00:: from mass---mass%1:07:00:: to size---size%1:07:00:: is unreliable , since many photographic meteors---meteor%1:17:00:: give evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: of a fluffy , loosely bound meteorite---meteorite%1:17:00:: structure---structure%1:06:00:: with densities---density%1:07:00:: as low as * * f .
To what extent such low density---low_density%1:07:00:: applies to micrometeorites---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: is unknown .
The velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: value---value%1:09:00:: used is also open to some question---question%1:07:00:: ; if a substantial fraction---fraction%1:06:00:: of the dust---dust%1:27:01:: is orbiting about the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: , only about one third---one-third%1:23:00:: the above mentioned average velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: should be used in deriving the mass---mass%1:07:00:: .
Zodiacal light---zodiacal_light%1:19:00:: and the gegenschein---gegenschein%1:19:00:: give some evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: for such a dust---dust%1:27:01:: blanket---blanket%1:17:00:: , a phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: also to be expected if the dust---dust%1:27:01:: before capture---capture%1:22:01:: is in circular orbits---orbit%1:15:00:: about the sun---sun%1:17:00:: , as indicated by the trend---trend%1:15:02:: of the smaller visible meteors---meteor%1:17:00:: .
The diurnal variation---diurnal_variation%1:11:00:: in the observed flux---flux%1:28:00:: may be partly due to the dependence---dependence%1:26:00:: of the detector---detector%1:06:00:: sensitivity---sensitivity%1:07:00:: on the incident velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: .
The flux---flux%1:28:00:: of micrometeorites---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: in the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: of the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: can be estimated by extrapolation---extrapolation%1:09:00:: from radar---radar%1:06:00:: and visual meteor---meteor%1:17:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: .
A summary---summary%1:10:00:: of meteorite---meteorite%1:17:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: , prepared by Whipple---person%1:03:00:: ( 1958 ) on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of photographic , visual , and radar---radar%1:06:00:: evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: , is given in Table---table%1:14:00:: 5 - 1 .
From an estimated mass---mass%1:07:00:: of 25 g---g%1:23:00:: for a zero---zero%1:23:01:: magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: meteorite---meteorite%1:17:00:: , the other masses---mass%1:07:00:: are derived with the assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: of a mass---mass%1:07:00:: decrease---decrease%1:11:00:: by a factor---factor%1:23:00:: of 2.512 for each unit---unit%1:23:00:: increase---increase%1:11:00:: in magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: .
The radius---radius%1:07:00:: is calculated from the mass---mass%1:07:00:: by assuming spheres---sphere%1:26:00:: of density---density%1:07:00:: * * f except for the smallest particles---particle%1:17:00:: , which must have a higher mass---mass%1:07:00:: density---density%1:07:00:: to remain in the solar system---solar_system%1:17:00:: in the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of solar radiation---solar_radiation%1:19:00:: pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: .
The flux---flux%1:28:00:: values---value%1:09:00:: are for all particles---particle%1:17:00:: with masses---mass%1:07:00:: greater than the given mass---mass%1:07:00:: and are based on an estimate---estimate%1:09:00:: of the numbers---number%1:07:00:: of visual meteors---meteor%1:17:00:: .
It is assumed that the flux---flux%1:28:00:: values---value%1:09:00:: increase by a factor---factor%1:23:00:: of 2.512 per magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: , in accordance---accordance%1:10:00:: with the opinion---opinion%1:10:01:: that the total mass---mass%1:07:00:: flux---flux%1:28:00:: in each unit---unit%1:23:00:: range in magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: is constant .
The values---value%1:09:00:: agree with the data---data%1:14:00:: from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta .
The figures---figure%1:23:00:: in the next-to-last column---column%1:14:01:: are derived with the assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: of 50 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: shielding---shielding%1:04:00:: by the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: ; hence , these figures---figure%1:23:00:: apply immediately above the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: 's atmosphere---atmosphere%1:15:00:: .
The unshielded flux---flux%1:28:00:: is given in the last column---column%1:14:01:: ; these figures---figure%1:23:00:: constitute the best estimate---estimate%1:09:00:: for the flux---flux%1:28:00:: in interplanetary space---interplanetary_space%1:15:00:: near the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: .
Of course , if there is a dust---dust%1:27:01:: blanket---blanket%1:17:00:: around the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: , the fluxes---flux%1:28:00:: in interplanetary space---interplanetary_space%1:15:00:: should be less than the figures---figure%1:23:00:: given here .
Note that the mass---mass%1:07:00:: scale---scale%1:24:01:: is one to two orders of magnitude---order_of_magnitude%1:07:00:: greater than some previously used ; for example , Jacchia---person%1:03:00:: ( 1948 ) derived a scale---scale%1:24:01:: of 0.15 g---g%1:23:00:: for a * * f , zero---zero%1:23:01:: magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: meteorite---meteorite%1:17:00:: .
The older scales---scale%1:24:01:: were based on theoretical estimates---estimate%1:09:00:: of the conversion---conversion%1:09:00:: efficiency---efficiency%1:24:00:: of kinetic energy---kinetic_energy%1:19:00:: into light---light%1:19:00:: .
The mass---mass%1:07:00:: scale---scale%1:24:01:: used in Table---table%1:14:00:: 5 - 1 was derived on the assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: that the motion---motion%1:11:00:: of the glowing trail---trail%1:17:01:: is related to the momentum---momentum%1:07:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: to the trail---trail%1:17:01:: by the meteorite---meteorite%1:17:00:: , permitting the calculation---calculation%1:09:00:: of the mass---mass%1:07:00:: if the velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: is known ( Cook---person%1:03:00:: and Whipple---person%1:03:00:: , 1958 ) .
A concentration---concentration%1:07:03:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: has been derived from radar---radar%1:06:00:: observations---observation%1:04:01:: sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: ( Manning---person%1:03:00:: and Eshleman---person%1:03:00:: , 1959 ) .
Extrapolation---extrapolation%1:09:00:: of this relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: through the thirtieth magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: covers the range of micrometeorites---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: .
The approximate equation---equation%1:10:00:: is * * f , where n is the number---number%1:23:00:: of * * f with electron---electron%1:17:00:: line---line%1:14:01:: density---density%1:07:00:: greater than or equal to * * f , and q is proportional to the mass---mass%1:07:00:: of the meteorite---meteorite%1:17:00:: .
Therefore , n is inversely proportional to the radius---radius%1:07:00:: cubed and in fair agreement---agreement%1:07:00:: with the inverse 7 2 power---power%1:10:00:: derived from 1958 Alpha and 1959 Eta data---data%1:14:00:: .
At the fifteenth magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: , * * f , and at the twenty-fifth magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: , * * f .
These extrapolated fluxes---flux%1:28:00:: are about an order of magnitude---order_of_magnitude%1:07:00:: less than the values---value%1:09:00:: from the satellite---satellite%1:06:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: and the figures---figure%1:23:00:: in Whipple---person%1:03:00:: 's table---table%1:14:00:: .
The extrapolation---extrapolation%1:09:00:: may be in error---error%1:07:00:: for several reasons---reason%1:10:01:: .
The observational data---data%1:14:00:: determining the concentration---concentration%1:07:03:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: have a range of error---error%1:07:00:: which is magnified in the extension---extension%1:04:02:: into the micrometeorite---micrometeorite%1:17:00:: region---region%1:15:00:: .
The solar electromagnetic - and corpuscular-radiation pressure---corpuscular-radiation_pressure%1:19:00:: and the associated Poynting-Robertson---person%1:03:00:: effect---effect%1:19:00:: increase in effectiveness---effectiveness%1:07:00:: as the particle---particle%1:17:00:: size---size%1:07:00:: decreases and modify the distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: and limit sizes---size%1:07:00:: to larger than a few microns---micron%1:23:00:: .
Also , it has been suggested that the source---source%1:15:00:: of all or part---part%1:17:00:: of the dust---dust%1:27:01:: may not be the same as that for visual or radar---radar%1:06:00:: meteorites---meteorite%1:17:00:: ( Best---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ) , and the same distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: would not be expected .
A measure of the total mass---mass%1:07:00:: accretion---accretion%1:22:00:: of meteoritic material---material%1:27:00:: by the Earth---earth%1:17:00:: is obtained from analyses---analysis%1:04:00:: of deep sea---sea%1:17:00:: sediments---sediment%1:17:00:: and dust---dust%1:27:01:: collected in remote regions---region%1:15:00:: ( Pettersson---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ) .
Most meteoritic material---material%1:27:00:: , by the time---time%1:11:00:: it reaches the Earth's surface---earth's_surface%1:17:00:: , has been reduced to dust---dust%1:27:01:: or to spherules---spherule%1:25:00:: of ablated material---material%1:27:00:: in its passage---passage%1:04:00:: through the atmosphere---atmosphere%1:15:00:: .
For all meteorites---meteorite%1:17:00:: , the average nickel---nickel%1:27:00:: content---content%1:24:00:: is about 2.5 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: .
This is much higher than the nickel---nickel%1:27:00:: content---content%1:24:00:: of terrestrial dusts---dust%1:27:01:: and sediments---sediment%1:17:00:: and provides a basis---basis%1:09:00:: for the determination---determination%1:04:00:: of the meteoritic mass---mass%1:07:00:: influx---influx%1:22:00:: .
Present data---data%1:14:00:: indicate an accretion---accretion%1:22:00:: of about * * f tons---ton%1:23:02:: per year over the entire globe---globe%1:17:00:: , or about * * f .
His eyes---eye%1:08:00:: were old and they never saw well , but heated with whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: they 'd glare at my noise---noise%1:11:00:: , growing red and raising up his rage---rage%1:12:00:: .
I decided I hated the Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: kid---kid%1:18:00:: too , dying in our kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: while I was away where I could n't watch , dying just to entertain Hans---person%1:03:00:: and making me go up snapping steps---steps%1:06:00:: and down a drafty hall---hall%1:06:03:: , Pa---pa%1:18:00:: lumped under the covers---cover%1:06:01:: at the end---end%1:15:00:: like dung---dung%1:27:00:: covered with snow---snow%1:27:00:: , snoring and whistling .
Oh he 'd not care about the Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: kid---kid%1:18:00:: .
He 'd not care about getting waked so he could give up some of his whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: to a slit of a kid---kid%1:18:00:: and maybe lose one of his hiding places---hiding_place%1:15:00:: in the bargain .
I did n't hurry though it was cold and the Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: kid---kid%1:18:00:: was in the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: .
I pushed at his shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: , calling his name---name%1:10:00:: .
I think his name---name%1:10:00:: stopped the snoring---snoring%1:04:00:: but he did n't move except to roll a little when I shoved him .
The covers---cover%1:06:01:: slid down his skinny neck---neck%1:08:00:: so I saw his head---head%1:08:00:: , fuzzed like a dandelion---dandelion%1:20:00:: gone to seed , but his face---face%1:08:00:: was turned to the wall---wall%1:06:00:: - there was the pale shadow---shadow%1:26:01:: of his nose---nose%1:08:00:: on the plaster---plaster%1:27:00:: - and I thought , Well you do n't look much like a pig-drunk bully---bully%1:18:00:: now .
I shook him a little harder and made some noise---noise%1:11:00:: .
He always slept close to the wall---wall%1:06:00:: so you had to lean to reach him .
I knew better but I was thinking of the Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: kid---kid%1:18:00:: mother-naked in all that dough---dough%1:13:00:: .
When his arm---arm%1:08:00:: came up I ducked away but it caught me on the side---side%1:06:00:: of the neck---neck%1:08:00:: , watering my eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , and I backed off to cough .
Pa---person%1:03:00:: was on his side---side%1:08:00:: , looking at me , his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: winking , the hand---hand%1:08:00:: that had hit me a fist---fist%1:08:00:: in the pillow---pillow%1:06:00:: .
I did n't say anything , trying to get my throat---throat%1:08:00:: clear , but I watched him .
He was like a mean horse---horse%1:05:00:: to come at from the rear---rear%1:15:00:: .
`` Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: sent me .
`` A fat hell on Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: .
`` He found the Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: kid---kid%1:18:00:: by the crib---crib%1:06:00:: '' .
Pa---pa%1:18:00:: pulled at the covers---cover%1:06:01:: .
He was tasting his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: .
`` The kid---kid%1:18:00:: 's froze good .
Hans---person%1:03:00:: is rubbing him with snow---snow%1:27:00:: .
He 's got him in the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` No---no%1:10:00:: , Pa---pa%1:18:00:: .
It 's the Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: kid---kid%1:18:00:: .
The kid---kid%1:18:00:: '' .
`` Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to steal from the crib---crib%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Not stealing , Pa---pa%1:18:00:: .
Hans---person%1:03:00:: found him froze .
That 's where he was when Hans---person%1:03:00:: found him '' .
Pa---pa%1:18:00:: laughed .
`` I ai n't hid nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: in the crib---crib%1:06:00:: '' .
`` You do n't understand , Pa---pa%1:18:00:: .
The Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: kid---kid%1:18:00:: .
The kid---kid%1:18:00:: '' -
Pa---pa%1:18:00:: had his head---head%1:08:00:: up , glaring , his teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: gnawing at the place---place%1:15:00:: where he 'd grown a mustache---mustache%1:08:00:: once .
You know I do n't want to see Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: .
You 're a fool---fool%1:18:01:: .
Both you and Hans---person%1:03:00:: .
Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: .
He was shouting and breathing hard and closing his fist---fist%1:08:00:: on the pillow---pillow%1:06:00:: .
He had long black hairs---hair%1:08:00:: on his wrist---wrist%1:08:00:: .
They curled around the cuff---cuff%1:06:00:: of his nightshirt---nightshirt%1:06:00:: .
`` Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: made me come .
Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: said '' -
`` A fat hell on Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: .
He 's an even bigger fool---fool%1:18:01:: than you are .
You want me to drop my pot---pot%1:06:01:: '' ?
He was about to get up so I got out , slamming the door---door%1:06:00:: .
Then he threw things---thing%1:06:00:: .
Once he went after Hans---person%1:03:00:: and dumped his pot---pot%1:06:01:: over the banister---banister%1:06:00:: .
Pa---pa%1:18:00:: 'd been shit---shit%1:27:00:: sick in that pot---pot%1:06:01:: .
Hans---person%1:03:00:: got an axe---axe%1:06:00:: .
He did n't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part---part%1:06:00:: of Pa---pa%1:18:00:: 's door---door%1:06:00:: down before he stopped .
He might not have gone that far if Pa---pa%1:18:00:: had n't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house---house%1:06:00:: .
That pot---pot%1:06:01:: put Pa---pa%1:18:00:: in an awful good humor---good_humor%1:12:00:: whenever he thought of it .
I always felt the memory---memory%1:09:02:: was present in both of them , stirring in their chests---chest%1:08:00:: like a laugh---laugh%1:10:00:: or a growl---growl%1:11:00:: , as eager as an animal---animal%1:03:00:: to be out .
I heard Pa---pa%1:18:00:: cursing all the way downstairs .
Hans---person%1:03:00:: had laid steaming towels---towel%1:06:00:: over the kid---kid%1:18:00:: 's chest---chest%1:08:00:: and stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: .
He was rubbing snow---snow%1:27:00:: on the kid---kid%1:18:00:: 's legs---leg%1:08:01:: and feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
Water---water%1:27:00:: from the snow---snow%1:27:00:: and water---water%1:27:00:: from the towels---towel%1:06:00:: had run off the kid---kid%1:18:00:: to the table---table%1:06:01:: where the dough---dough%1:13:00:: was , and the dough---dough%1:13:00:: was turning pasty , sticking to the kid---kid%1:18:00:: 's back---back%1:08:00:: and behind---behind%1:08:00:: .
`` What about your pa---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Did you get the whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: '' ?
`` He said a fat hell on Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Did you ask him about the whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: '' ?
`` He said a fat hell on Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` Go back to sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: most likely '' .
`` You 'd best get that whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: '' .
Take the axe---axe%1:06:00:: .
Pa---pa%1:18:00:: 's scared to hell of axes---axe%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Listen to me , Jorge---person%1:03:00:: , I 've had enough---enough%1:23:00:: to your sassing---sassing%1:10:00:: .
This kid---kid%1:18:00:: 's froze bad .
If I do n't get some whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: down him he might die .
You want the kid---kid%1:18:00:: to die ?
Well , get your pa---pa%1:18:00:: and get that whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: '' .
`` Pa---pa%1:18:00:: do n't care about the kid---kid%1:18:00:: '' .
`` Jorge---person%1:03:00:: '' .
He do n't care at all , and I do n't care to get my head---head%1:08:00:: busted neither .
He do n't care , and I do n't care to have his shit---shit%1:10:00:: flung on me .
All he cares about is his whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: and that dry crack---crack%1:06:00:: in his face---face%1:08:00:: .
He do n't care about nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: else at all .
Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
Not Pedersen---person%1:03:00:: 's kid---kid%1:18:00:: neither .
Not the kid---kid%1:18:00:: neither '' .
`` I 'll get the spirits---spirits%1:13:00:: '' , Ma---ma%1:18:00:: said .
I 'd wound Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: up tight .
I was ready to jump but when Ma---ma%1:18:00:: said she 'd get the whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: it surprised him like it surprised me , and he ran down .
Ma---ma%1:18:00:: never went near the old man---old_man%1:18:01:: when he was sleeping it off .
Not for years---year%1:28:01:: .
The first thing---thing%1:11:00:: every morning---morning%1:28:00:: when she washed her face---face%1:08:00:: she could see the scar---scar%1:26:00:: on her chin---chin%1:08:00:: where he 'd cut her with a boot---boot%1:06:00:: cleat---cleat%1:06:02:: , and maybe she saw him heaving it again , the dirty sock---sock%1:06:00:: popping out as it flew .
It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember that as it was for Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: to remember going after the axe---axe%1:06:00:: while he was still spattered with Pa---pa%1:18:00:: 's yellow sick insides---inside%1:15:01:: .
`` No---no%1:10:00:: you won't '' , Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Yes---yes%1:10:00:: , Hans---person%1:03:00:: , if they 're needed '' , Ma---ma%1:18:00:: said .
Hans---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: but neither of us tried to stop her .
If we had , then one---one%1:23:00:: of us would have had to go instead .
Hans---person%1:03:00:: rubbed the kid---kid%1:18:00:: with more snow---snow%1:27:00:: & & & rubbed & & & rubbed .
`` I 'll get more snow---snow%1:27:00:: '' , I said .
I took the pail---pail%1:06:00:: and shovel---shovel%1:06:00:: and went out on the porch---porch%1:06:00:: .
I do n't know where Ma---ma%1:18:00:: went .
She had surprised Hans---person%1:03:00:: like she had surprised me when she said she 'd go , and then she surprised him again when she came back so quick like she must have , because when I came in with the snow---snow%1:27:00:: she was there with a bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: with three white feathers---feather%1:05:00:: on its label---label%1:10:00:: and Hans---person%1:03:00:: was holding it angrily by the throat---throat%1:06:00:: .
Oh , he was being queer and careful , pawing about in the drawer---drawer%1:06:00:: and holding the bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: like a snake---snake%1:05:00:: at the length---length%1:07:00:: of his arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
He was awful angry because he 'd thought Ma---ma%1:18:00:: was going to do something big , something heroic even , especially for her .
We felt the same sometimes , while Ma---ma%1:18:00:: was n't thinking about that at all , not anything like that .
There was no way---way%1:04:01:: of getting even .
It was n't like getting cheated at the fair---fair%1:04:01:: .
Now Hans---person%1:03:00:: had given Ma---ma%1:18:00:: something of his - we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa---pa%1:18:00:: - something valuable ; but since she did n't know we 'd given it to her , there was no easy way---way%1:04:01:: of getting it back .
Hans---person%1:03:00:: cut the foil---foil%1:06:01:: off finally and unscrewed the cap---cap%1:06:02:: .
He was put out too because there was only one way---way%1:04:01:: of understanding what she 'd done .
Ma---ma%1:18:00:: had found one---one%1:23:00:: of Pa---pa%1:18:00:: 's hiding places---hiding_place%1:15:00:: .
She 'd found one and she had n't said a word---word%1:10:00:: while Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all winter---winter%1:28:00:: , every winter---winter%1:28:00:: since the spring---spring%1:28:00:: that Hans---person%1:03:00:: had come and I had looked in the privy---privy%1:06:01:: and found the first one .
Pa---pa%1:18:00:: had a knack---knack%1:09:00:: for hiding---hiding%1:04:00:: .
But now Ma---ma%1:18:00:: .
She 'd found it by luck most likely but she had n't said anything and we did n't know how long ago it 'd been or how many other ones she 'd found , saying nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
Pa---pa%1:18:00:: was sure to find out .
A fool---fool%1:18:01:: could see what was going on .
If he found out Ma---ma%1:18:00:: found it - that 'd be bad .
He took pride in his hiding---hiding%1:04:00:: .
It was all the pride---pride%1:12:00:: he had .
I guess fooling Hans---person%1:03:00:: and me took doing .
But he did n't figure Ma---ma%1:18:00:: for much .
He did n't figure her at all , and if he found out * * h a woman---woman%1:18:00:: * * h it 'd be bad .
Hans---person%1:03:00:: poured some in a tumbler---tumbler%1:06:00:: .
`` You going to put more towels---towel%1:06:00:: on him '' ?
`` No---no%1:10:00:: '' .
That 's what he needs , something warm to his skin---skin%1:08:00:: , do n't he '' ?
Heat---heat%1:09:00:: 's bad for frostbite---frostbite%1:26:00:: .
That 's why I only put towels---towel%1:06:00:: on his chest---chest%1:08:00:: and belly---belly%1:08:00:: .
Colors---color%1:07:00:: on the towels---towel%1:06:00:: had run .
Ma---ma%1:18:00:: poked her toe---toe%1:08:01:: in the kid---kid%1:18:00:: 's clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: .
Big Hans---person%1:03:00:: began pouring whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: in the kid---kid%1:18:00:: 's mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: but his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: filled without any getting down his throat---throat%1:08:00:: and in a second---second%1:28:00:: it was dripping from his chin---chin%1:08:00:: .
I got hold his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: open '' .
I did n't want to touch him and I hoped Ma---ma%1:18:00:: would do it but she kept looking at the kid---kid%1:18:00:: 's clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: piled on the floor---floor%1:06:00:: and the pool---pool%1:17:01:: of water---water%1:27:00:: by them and did n't make any move---move%1:04:00:: to .
`` Come on , Jorge---person%1:03:00:: '' .
I took him by the shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
His head---head%1:08:00:: flopped back .
His mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: fell open .
The skin---skin%1:08:00:: on his neck---neck%1:08:00:: was tight .
`` Hold his head---head%1:08:00:: up .
`` His mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: is open '' .
`` His throat---throat%1:08:00:: 's shut .
`` Hold his head---head%1:08:00:: up '' .
Put your arms---arm%1:08:00:: around him '' .
I put my arm---arm%1:08:00:: carefully around him .
Hans---person%1:03:00:: had his fingers---finger%1:08:00:: in the kid---kid%1:18:00:: 's mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: .
I had my arm---arm%1:08:00:: behind his back---back%1:08:00:: .
Dear Sirs : Let me begin by clearing up any possible misconception---misconception%1:09:00:: in your minds---mind%1:09:00:: , wherever you are .
The collective---collective%1:14:00:: by which I address you in the title---title%1:10:00:: above is neither patronizing nor jocose but an exact industrial term---term%1:10:00:: in use among professional thieves---thief%1:18:00:: .
It is , I am reliably given to understand , the technical argot---argot%1:10:00:: for those who engage in your particular branch---branch%1:14:00:: of the boost---boost%1:04:00:: ; i.e. , burglars---burglar%1:18:00:: who rob while the tenants---tenant%1:18:00:: are absent , in contrast---contrast%1:04:00:: to hot slough prowlers---prowler%1:18:00:: , those who work while the occupants---occupant%1:18:00:: are home .
Since the latter obviously require an audacity---audacity%1:07:00:: you do not possess , you may perhaps suppose that I am taunting you as socially inferior .
Far from it ; I merely draw an etymological distinction---distinction%1:07:01:: , hoping that specialists---specialist%1:18:00:: and busy people---people%1:14:00:: like you will welcome such precision---precision%1:07:00:: in a layman---layman%1:18:00:: .
Above all , disabuse yourselves of any thought---thought%1:09:01:: that I propose to vent moral indignation---indignation%1:12:00:: at your rifling my residence---residence%1:06:00:: , to whimper over the loss---loss%1:21:01:: of a few objets d'art---objet_d'art%1:06:00:: , or to shame you into rectitude---rectitude%1:07:00:: .
My object---object%1:09:00:: , rather , is to alert you to an aspect---aspect%1:07:02:: or two of the affair---affair%1:09:00:: that could have the gravest implications---implication%1:09:00:: for you , far beyond the legal sanctions---sanction%1:10:00:: society---society%1:14:00:: might inflict .
You have unwittingly set in motion forces---force%1:04:01:: so malign , so vindictive , that it would be downright inhumane of me not to warn you about them .
Quite candidly , fellows---fellow%1:18:00:: , I would n't be in your shoes for all the rice---rice%1:13:00:: in China---china%1:15:00:: .
As you 've doubtless forgotten the circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: in the press---press%1:26:00:: of more recent depredations---depredation%1:04:00:: , permit me to recapitulate them briefly .
Sometime on Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: evening---evening%1:28:00:: , August---august%1:28:00:: 22nd , while my family---family%1:14:00:: and I were dining at the Hostaria dell 'Orso---group%1:03:00:: , in Rome---rome%1:15:00:: , you jimmied a window---window%1:06:00:: of our home---home%1:06:00:: in Bucks County---location%1:03:00:: , Pennsylvania---pennsylvania%1:15:00:: , and let yourselves into the premises---premises%1:15:00:: .
Hastening to the attic---attic%1:06:00:: , the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of which was easily hotter than the Gold Coast---location%1:03:00:: , you proceeded to mask the windows---window%1:06:00:: with a fancy wool---wool%1:06:00:: coverlet---coverlet%1:06:00:: , some khaki pants , and the like---the_like%1:09:00:: , and to ransack the innumerable boxes---box%1:06:00:: and barrels---barrel%1:25:00:: stored there .
What you were looking for ( unless you make a hobby---hobby%1:04:00:: of collecting old tennis rackets---tennis_racket%1:06:00:: and fly---fly%1:05:00:: screens---screen%1:06:00:: ) eludes me , but to judge from phonograph records---phonograph_record%1:06:00:: scattered about a fumed oak---fumed_oak%1:20:00:: Victrola---victrola%1:06:00:: , you danced two tangos---tango%1:04:00:: and a paso doble---paso_doble%1:04:00:: , which must have been fairly enervating in that milieu---milieu%1:26:00:: .
You then descended one story---story%1:06:00:: , glommed a television set---television_set%1:06:00:: from the music---music%1:10:00:: room---room%1:06:00:: - the only constructive feature---feature%1:09:00:: of your visit---visit%1:14:00:: , by the way - and , returning to the ground floor---ground_floor%1:06:00:: , entered the master bedroom---master_bedroom%1:06:00:: .
From the curio---curio%1:06:00:: cabinet---cabinet%1:06:00:: on its south wall---wall%1:06:00:: and the bureaus---bureau%1:06:00:: beneath , you abstracted seventeen ivory---ivory%1:27:00:: , metal---metal%1:27:00:: , wood---wood%1:27:00:: , and stone---stone%1:27:00:: sculptures---sculpture%1:06:00:: of Oriental and African origin---origin%1:15:00:: , two snuffboxes---snuffbox%1:06:00:: , and a jade---jade%1:27:00:: handled magnifying glass---magnifying_glass%1:06:00:: .
Rummaging through a stack---stack%1:14:00:: of drawers---drawer%1:06:00:: nearby , you unearthed an antique French chess set---chess_set%1:14:00:: in ivory---ivory%1:27:00:: and sandalwood---sandalwood%1:20:00:: , which , along with two box Kodaks---box_kodak%1:06:00:: , you added to your haul---haul%1:04:00:: .
Then , having wrapped the lot---lot%1:14:01:: in an afghan---afghan%1:06:00:: my dog---dog%1:05:00:: customarily slept on , you lammed out the front door---front_door%1:06:00:: , considerately leaving it open for neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: to discover .
So much for the tiresome facts---fact%1:09:01:: , as familiar to you , I'm sure , as to the constables---constable%1:18:00:: and state---state%1:15:01:: troopers---trooper%1:18:00:: who followed in your wake---wake%1:19:00:: .
The foregoing , aided by several clues---clue%1:10:01:: I 'll withhold to keep you on your toes , will pursue you with a tenacity---tenacity%1:07:00:: worthy of Inspector Javert---person%1:03:00:: , but before they close in , gird yourselves , I repeat , for a vengeance---vengeance%1:04:00:: infinitely more pitiless .
Fourteen---fourteen%1:23:00:: of the sculptures---sculpture%1:06:00:: you took posses properties---property%1:07:00:: of a most curious and terrifying nature---nature%1:07:02:: , as you will observe when your limbs---limb%1:08:00:: begin to wither and your hair---hair%1:08:00:: falls out in patches---patch%1:07:00:: .
In time , these minor manifestations---manifestation%1:10:00:: will multiply and effloresce , riddling you with frambesia---frambesia%1:26:00:: , the king's evil---king's_evil%1:26:00:: , sheep rot---sheep_rot%1:26:00:: , and clonic spasm---spasm%1:26:00:: , until your very existence---existence%1:26:00:: becomes a burden---burden%1:09:01:: and you cry out for release---release%1:11:00:: .
All this , though , is simply a prelude---prelude%1:11:00:: , a curtain-raiser---curtain_raiser%1:04:00:: , for what ensues , and I doubt whether any Occidental---occidental%1:18:00:: could accurately forecast it .
If , however , it would help to intensify your anguish---anguish%1:12:02:: , I can delimit the powers---power%1:18:00:: of a few of the divinities---divinity%1:18:00:: you 've affronted and describe the punishment---punishment%1:04:00:: they meted out in one analogous instance---instance%1:11:00:: .
First of all , the six figures---figure%1:06:00:: of the Buddha---buddha%1:18:00:: you heisted - four Siamese---siamese%1:10:00:: heads---head%1:08:00:: , a black obsidian---obsidian%1:27:00:: statuette---statuette%1:06:00:: in the earth---earth%1:17:01:: touching position---position%1:15:00:: , and a large brass---brass%1:27:00:: figure---figure%1:06:00:: of the Dying Buddha on a teakwood---teakwood%1:20:00:: base---base%1:06:00:: .
Now , you probably share the widespread Western belief---belief%1:09:01:: that the Lord Buddha---person%1:03:00:: is the most compassionate of the gods---god%1:18:01:: , much more so than Jehovah---person%1:03:00:: and Allah---person%1:03:00:: and the rest---rest%1:24:00:: .
Well , ordinarily he is , except ( as the Wheel of the Law specifies ) toward impious folk---folk%1:14:01:: who steal , disturb , or maltreat the Presence---presence%1:18:00:: .
Very peculiar retribution---retribution%1:21:00:: indeed seems to overtake such jokers---joker%1:18:00:: .
Eight or ten years---year%1:28:01:: ago , a couple of French---french%1:18:00:: hoods---hood%1:18:00:: stole a priceless Khmer---khmer%1:10:00:: head---head%1:08:00:: from the Musee Guimet---group%1:03:00:: , in Paris---paris%1:15:00:: , and a week---week%1:28:00:: later crawled into the Salpetriere---group%1:03:00:: with unmistakable symptoms---symptom%1:26:00:: of leprosy---leprosy%1:26:00:: .
Hell 's own amount---amount%1:09:00:: of chaulmoogra oil---chaulmoogra_oil%1:27:00:: did nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to alleviate their torment---torment%1:26:00:: ; they expired amid indescribable fantods---fantods%1:26:00:: , imploring the Blessed One---person%1:03:00:: to forgive their desecration---desecration%1:04:00:: .
Any reputable French---french%1:18:00:: interne---interne%1:18:00:: can supply you with a dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: similar instances---instance%1:11:00:: , and I 'll presently recount a case---case%1:11:00:: out of my own personal experience---experience%1:11:00:: , but , for the moment , let 's resume our catalogue---catalogue%1:10:01:: .
Whether the pair---pair%1:14:01:: of Sudanese---sudanese%1:18:00:: ivory---ivory%1:27:00:: carvings---carving%1:06:00:: you lifted really possess the juju---juju%1:09:00:: to turn your livers---liver%1:08:00:: to lead---lead%1:27:00:: , as a dealer---dealer%1:18:02:: in Khartoum---khartoum%1:15:00:: assured me , I am not competent to say .
Likewise the ivory---ivory%1:27:00:: Chinese female---female%1:18:00:: figure---figure%1:06:00:: known as a `` doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: lady---lady%1:18:02:: '' ( provenance---provenance%1:15:00:: Honan---location%1:03:00:: ) ; a friend---friend%1:18:00:: of mine removing her from the curio---curio%1:06:00:: cabinet---cabinet%1:06:00:: for inspection was felled as if by a hammer---hammer%1:06:00:: , but he had previously drunk a quantity---quantity%1:07:00:: of applejack---applejack%1:13:00:: .
The three Indian brass---brass%1:27:00:: deities---deity%1:18:00:: , though - Ganessa---person%1:03:00:: , Siva---person%1:03:00:: , and Krishna---person%1:03:00:: - are an altogether different cup of tea---cup_of_tea%1:04:00:: .
They hail from Travancore---location%1:03:00:: , a state---state%1:15:01:: in the subcontinent---subcontinent%1:17:00:: where Kali---person%1:03:00:: , the goddess---goddess%1:18:00:: of death---death%1:28:00:: , is worshiped .
Have you ever heard of thuggee---thuggee%1:04:00:: ?
But it is the wooden sculpture---sculpture%1:04:00:: from Bali---bali%1:15:00:: , the one representing two men---man%1:18:00:: with their heads---head%1:08:00:: bent backward and their bodies---body%1:08:00:: interlaced by a fish---fish%1:05:00:: , that I particularly call to your attention---attention%1:09:00:: .
Oddly enough , this is an amulet---amulet%1:06:00:: against housebreakers---housebreaker%1:18:00:: , presented to the mem and me by a local rajah---rajah%1:18:00:: in 1949 .
Inscribed around its base---base%1:06:00:: is a charm---charm%1:10:00:: in Balinese---balinese%1:10:00:: , a dialect---dialect%1:10:00:: I take it you do n't comprehend .
Neither do I , but the Tjokorda Agoeng---person%1:03:00:: was good enough to translate , and I 'll do as much---much%1:23:00:: for you .
Whosoever violates our rooftree---rooftree%1:06:00:: , the legend---legend%1:10:01:: states , can expect maximal sorrow---sorrow%1:09:00:: .
The teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: will rain from his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: like pebbles---pebble%1:17:00:: , his wife---wife%1:18:00:: will make him cocu with fishmongers---fishmonger%1:18:00:: , and a trolley car---trolley_car%1:06:00:: will grow in his stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: .
Furthermore - and this , to me , strikes an especially warming note---note%1:07:00:: - it shall avail the vandals---vandal%1:18:00:: naught---naught%1:23:00:: to throw away or dispose of their loot---loot%1:21:00:: .
The cycle---cycle%1:11:02:: of disaster---disaster%1:26:00:: starts the moment---moment%1:28:00:: they touch any belonging---belongings%1:21:00:: of ours , and dogs them unto the forty-fifth generation---generation%1:14:00:: .
Now , you no doubt regard the preceding as pap---pap%1:10:00:: ; you 're tooling around full of gage---gage%1:06:01:: in your hot rods---hot_rod%1:06:00:: , gorging yourselves on pizza---pizza%1:13:00:: and playing pinball---pinball%1:04:00:: in the taverns---tavern%1:06:00:: and generally behaving like Ubermenschen---ubermensch%1:18:00:: .
In that case---case%1:11:00:: , listen to what befell another wisenheimer---wisenheimer%1:18:00:: who tangled with our joss---joss%1:06:00:: .
A couple of years---year%1:28:01:: back , I occupied a Village---location%1:03:00:: apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: whose outer staircase---staircase%1:06:00:: contained the type---type%1:09:00:: of niche---niche%1:06:00:: called a `` coffin---coffin%1:06:00:: turn---turn%1:25:00:: '' .
In it was a stone---stone%1:27:00:: Tibetan---tibetan%1:10:00:: Buddha---buddha%1:18:00:: I had picked up in Bombay---bombay%1:15:00:: , and occasionally , to make merit---merit%1:07:02:: , my wife---wife%1:18:00:: and I garlanded it with flowers---flower%1:20:00:: or laid a few pennies---penny%1:23:00:: in its lap---lap%1:08:00:: .
After a while---while%1:28:00:: , we became aware that the money---money%1:21:00:: was disappearing as fast as we replenished it .
Our suspicions---suspicion%1:09:01:: eventually centered , by the process---process%1:04:00:: of elimination---elimination%1:04:02:: , on a grocer---grocer%1:18:00:: 's boy---boy%1:18:00:: , a thoroughly bad hat---bad_hat%1:18:00:: , who delivered cartons---carton%1:23:00:: to the people---people%1:14:00:: overhead .
The more I probed into this young man---young_man%1:18:00:: 's activities---activity%1:04:00:: and character---character%1:26:00:: , the less savory I found him .
I learned , for example , that he made a practice---practice%1:04:00:: of yapping at dogs---dog%1:05:00:: he encountered and , in winter---winter%1:28:00:: , of sprinkling salt---salt%1:27:00:: on the icy pavement---pavement%1:27:00:: to scarify their feet---foot%1:05:01:: .
His energy---energy%1:07:01:: was prodigious ; sometimes he would be up before dawn---dawn%1:28:00:: , clad as a garbage collector---garbage_collector%1:18:00:: and hurling pails---pail%1:06:00:: into areaways---areaway%1:06:00:: to exasperate us , and thereafter would hurry to the Bronx Zoo---group%1:03:00:: to grimace at the lions---lion%1:05:00:: and press cigar butts---cigar_butt%1:06:00:: against their paws---paw%1:05:00:: .
Evenings---evening%1:28:00:: , he was frequently to be seen at restaurants---restaurant%1:06:00:: like Enrico---person%1:03:00:: + Paglieri's---person%1:03:00:: or Peter's Backyard---group%1:03:00:: drunkenly donning ladies---lady%1:18:02:: ' hats---hat%1:06:00:: and singing `` O Sole Mio '' .
In short , and to borrow an arboreal phrase---phrase%1:10:00:: , slash timber .
Well , the odious little toad---toad%1:05:00:: went along chivying animals---animal%1:03:00:: and humans who could n't retaliate , and in due course , as was inevitable , overreached himself .
One morning---morning%1:28:00:: , we discovered not only that the pennies---penny%1:23:00:: were missing from the idol---idol%1:06:00:: but that a cigarette---cigarette%1:06:00:: had been stubbed out in its lap---lap%1:08:00:: .
`` Now he 's bought it '' , said my wife---wife%1:18:00:: contentedly .
`` No divinity---divinity%1:18:00:: will hold still for that .
The next time---time%1:11:00:: we saw him , he was a changed person---person%1:03:00:: ; he had aged thirty years---year%1:28:01:: , and his face---face%1:08:00:: , the color---color%1:07:00:: of tallow---tallow%1:27:00:: , was crisscrossed with wrinkles---wrinkle%1:25:00:: , as though it had been wrapped in chicken---chicken%1:13:00:: wire---wire%1:06:00:: .
Some sort of nemesis---nemesis%1:18:00:: was haunting his footsteps---footstep%1:23:00:: , he told us in a quavering voice---voice%1:10:00:: - either an ape---ape%1:05:00:: specter---specter%1:09:00:: or Abe Spector---person%1:03:00:: , a process server---process-server%1:18:00:: , we could n't determine which .
His eyes---eye%1:08:00:: had the same dreadful rigid stare---stare%1:04:00:: as Dr. Grimesby Roylott---person%1:03:00:: 's when he was found before his open safe---safe%1:06:00:: wearing the speckled band---band%1:06:00:: .
The grocery---grocery%1:06:00:: the youth---youth%1:18:00:: worked for soon tired of his depressing effect---effect%1:19:00:: on customers---customer%1:18:00:: , most of whom were sufficiently neurotic without the threat---threat%1:26:00:: of incubi---incubus%1:18:00:: , and let him go .
The beautiful , the satisfying part---part%1:24:00:: of his disintegration---disintegration%1:26:00:: , however , was the masterly way---way%1:07:01:: the Buddha---buddha%1:18:00:: polished him off .
Reduced to beggary---beggary%1:10:00:: , he at last got a job---job%1:04:00:: as office boy---office_boy%1:18:00:: to a television---television%1:10:00:: producer---producer%1:18:02:: .
His hubris---hubris%1:07:00:: , deficiency---deficiency%1:26:00:: of taste---taste%1:09:01:: , and sadism---sadism%1:12:00:: carried him straightaway to the top---top%1:26:00:: .
He evolved programs---program%1:10:01:: that plumbed new depths---depth%1:07:00:: of bathos---bathos%1:10:00:: and besmirched whole networks---network%1:06:01:: , and quickly superseded his boss---boss%1:18:00:: .
Not long ago , I rode down with him in an elevator---elevator%1:06:00:: in Radio City---group%1:03:00:: ; he was talking to himself thirteen to the dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: and smoking two cigars---cigar%1:06:00:: at once , clearly a man---man%1:18:00:: in extremis .
`` See that guy---guy%1:18:00:: '' ? the operator---operator%1:18:00:: asked pityingly .
`` I would n't be in his shoes for all the rice---rice%1:13:00:: in China---china%1:15:00:: .
There 's some kind of a nemesis---nemesis%1:18:00:: haunting his footsteps---footstep%1:23:00:: '' .
However one looks at it , therefore , I 'd say that your horoscope---horoscope%1:10:00:: for this autumn---autumn%1:28:00:: is the reverse---reverse%1:24:00:: of rosy .
The inventory---inventory%1:06:00:: you acquired from me is n't going to be easy to move ; you can't very well sidle up to people---people%1:14:00:: on the street---street%1:06:00:: and ask if they want to buy a hot Bodhisattva---person%1:03:00:: .
Additionally , since you 're going to be hors de combat pretty soon with sprue---sprue%1:26:00:: , yaws---yaws%1:26:00:: , Delhi boil---delhi_boil%1:26:00:: , the Granville wilt---granville_wilt%1:26:00:: , liver fluke---liver_fluke%1:05:00:: , bilharziasis---bilharziasis%1:26:00:: , and a host---host%1:14:00:: of other complications---complication%1:04:00:: of the hex---hex%1:10:00:: you 've aroused , you must n't expect to be lionized socially .
My advice---advice%1:10:00:: , if you live long enough to continue your vocation---vocation%1:04:00:: , is that the next time---time%1:11:00:: you 're attracted by the exotic , pass it up - it 's nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but a headache---headache%1:26:00:: .
S. J. Perelman---person%1:03:00:: .
The doors---door%1:06:00:: of the D train---train%1:06:00:: slid shut , and as I dropped into a seat---seat%1:15:01:: and , exhaling , looked up across the aisle---aisle%1:06:00:: , the whole aviary---aviary%1:06:00:: in my head---head%1:08:00:: burst into song---song%1:10:02:: .
She was a living doll---doll%1:06:00:: and no mistake---mistake%1:09:00:: - the blue-black bang---bang%1:08:00:: , the wide cheekbones---cheekbone%1:08:00:: , olive flushed , that betrayed the Cherokee---cherokee%1:10:00:: strain in her Midwestern lineage---lineage%1:14:00:: , and the mouth---mouth%1:08:00:: whose only fault---fault%1:26:00:: , in the novelist---novelist%1:18:00:: 's carping phrase---phrase%1:10:00:: , was that the lower lip---lip%1:08:00:: was a trifle too voluptuous .
From what I was able to gauge in a swift , greedy glance---glance%1:04:00:: , the figure---figure%1:08:00:: inside the coral---coral%1:07:00:: colored boucle---boucle%1:06:00:: dress---dress%1:06:00:: was stupefying .
In the dim underwater light---light%1:15:00:: they dressed and straightened up the room---room%1:06:00:: , and then they went across the hall---hall%1:06:03:: to the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: .
She was intimidated by the stove---stove%1:06:01:: .
He found the pilot light---pilot_light%1:06:01:: and turned on one of the burners---burner%1:06:00:: for her .
The gas---gas%1:27:02:: flamed up two inches---inch%1:23:00:: high .
They found the teakettle---teakettle%1:06:00:: and put water---water%1:27:00:: on to boil and then searched through the icebox---icebox%1:06:00:: .
Several sections---section%1:06:00:: of a loaf---loaf%1:13:00:: of dark bread---dark_bread%1:13:00:: ; butter---butter%1:13:00:: ; jam---jam%1:13:00:: ; a tiny cake---cake%1:06:00:: of ice---ice%1:27:00:: .
In their search---search%1:04:00:: for what turned out to be the right breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: china---china%1:06:00:: but the wrong table---table%1:06:02:: silver---silver%1:06:00:: , they opened every cupboard---cupboard%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:00:: in the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: and pantry---pantry%1:06:00:: .
While she was settling the teacart---teacart%1:06:00:: , he went back across the hall---hall%1:06:03:: to their bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: , opened one of the suitcases---suitcase%1:06:00:: , and took out powdered coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: and sugar---sugar%1:13:00:: .
She appeared with the teacart---teacart%1:06:00:: and he opened the windows---window%1:06:00:: .
`` Do you want to call Eugene---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
He did n't , but it was not really a question---question%1:10:00:: , and so he left the room---room%1:06:00:: , walked down the hall---hall%1:06:03:: to the front---front%1:15:00:: of the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: , hesitated , and then knocked lightly on the closed door---door%1:06:00:: of the study---study%1:06:00:: .
A sleepy voice---voice%1:10:00:: answered .
`` Le petit dejeuner---petit_dejeuner%1:13:00:: '' , Harold---person%1:03:00:: said , in an accent---accent%1:10:01:: that did credit---credit%1:10:00:: to Miss Sloan---person%1:03:00:: , his high-school---high_school%1:14:00:: French teacher---french_teacher%1:18:00:: .
At the same time , his voice---voice%1:10:00:: betrayed uncertainty---uncertainty%1:09:00:: about their being here , and conveyed an appeal---appeal%1:10:00:: to whatever is reasonable , peace-loving , and dependable in everybody .
Since ordinary breakfast-table---breakfast_table%1:06:00:: conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: was impossible , it was at least something that they were able to offer Eugene---person%1:03:00:: the sugar bowl---sugar_bowl%1:06:00:: with their sugar---sugar%1:13:00:: in it , and the plate---plate%1:06:00:: of bread and butter---bread_and_butter%1:21:00:: , and that Eugene---person%1:03:00:: could return the pitcher---pitcher%1:06:00:: of hot milk---milk%1:13:01:: to them handle---handle%1:06:00:: first .
Eugene---person%1:03:00:: put a spoonful---spoonful%1:23:00:: of powdered coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: into his cup---cup%1:06:00:: and then filled it with hot water---water%1:27:00:: .
Stirring , he said : `` I am sorry that my work---work%1:04:01:: prevents me from doing anything with you today '' .
Harold---person%1:03:00:: put a teaspoonful---teaspoonful%1:23:01:: of powdered coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: in his cup---cup%1:06:00:: and filled it with hot water---water%1:27:00:: , and then , stirring , he sat back in his chair---chair%1:06:00:: .
The chair---chair%1:06:00:: creaked .
Every time---time%1:11:00:: he moved or said something , the chair---chair%1:06:00:: creaked again .
Eugene---person%1:03:00:: was not entirely silent , or openly rude - unless asking Harold---person%1:03:00:: to move to another chair---chair%1:06:00:: and placing himself in the fauteuil---fauteuil%1:06:00:: that creaked so alarmingly was an act---act%1:03:00:: of rudeness---rudeness%1:07:00:: .
It went right on creaking under his own considerable weight---weight%1:07:00:: , and all it needed , Harold---person%1:03:00:: thought , was for somebody to fling himself back in a fit---fit%1:26:00:: of laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: and that would be the end---end%1:28:00:: of it .
Through the open window---window%1:06:00:: they heard sounds---sound%1:19:00:: below in the street---street%1:06:00:: : cartwheels---cartwheel%1:06:00:: , a tired horse---horse%1:05:00:: 's plodding step---step%1:23:00:: , voices---voice%1:10:00:: .
Harold---person%1:03:00:: indicated the photograph---photograph%1:06:00:: on the wall---wall%1:06:00:: and asked what church---church%1:06:00:: the stone---stone%1:06:00:: sculpture---sculpture%1:06:00:: was in .
Eugene---person%1:03:00:: told him and he promptly forgot .
They passed the marmalade---marmalade%1:13:00:: , the bread---bread%1:13:00:: , the black-market butter---butter%1:13:00:: , back and forth .
Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: was said about hotels---hotel%1:06:00:: or train---train%1:06:00:: journeys---journey%1:04:00:: .
Eugene---person%1:03:00:: offered Harold---person%1:03:00:: his car---car%1:06:00:: , to use at any time---time%1:28:00:: he cared to , and when this offer was not accepted , the armchair---armchair%1:06:00:: creaked .
They all three had another cup---cup%1:23:01:: of coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: .
Eugene---person%1:03:00:: was in his pajamas and dressing gown---dressing_gown%1:06:00:: , and on his large feet---foot%1:08:01:: he wore yellow Turkish slippers---slipper%1:06:00:: that turned up at the toes---toe%1:08:01:: .
`` Ex-cuse---excuse%1:10:00:: me '' , he said in Berlitz English , and got up and left them , to bathe and dress .
The first shrill ring of the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: brought Harold---person%1:03:00:: out into the hall---hall%1:06:03:: .
He realized that he had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: where the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: was .
At that moment---moment%1:28:00:: the bathroom---bathroom%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:00:: flew open and Eugene---person%1:03:00:: came out , with his face---face%1:08:00:: lathered for shaving---shaving%1:04:00:: , and strode down the hall---hall%1:06:03:: , tying the sash---sash%1:06:01:: of his dressing gown---dressing_gown%1:06:00:: as he went .
The telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: was in the study---study%1:06:00:: but the ringing---ringing%1:11:00:: came from the hall---hall%1:06:03:: .
Between the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: and the wall plug---wall_plug%1:06:00:: there was sixty feet---foot%1:23:00:: of cord---cord%1:06:00:: , and when the conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: came to an end---end%1:28:00:: , Eugene---person%1:03:00:: carried the instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: with him the whole length---length%1:07:01:: of the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: , to his bathroom---bathroom%1:06:00:: , where it rang three more times---time%1:11:00:: while he was shaving---shaving%1:04:00:: and in the tub---tub%1:06:01:: .
Before he left the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: he knocked on their door---door%1:06:00:: and asked if there was anything he could do for them .
Harold---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
`` Sabine---person%1:03:00:: called a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: ago '' , Eugene---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` She wants you and Barbara---person%1:03:00:: to have dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: with her tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: '' .
He handed Harold---person%1:03:00:: a key---key%1:06:00:: to the front door---front_door%1:06:00:: , and cautioned him against leaving it unlocked while they were out of the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: .
When enough time---time%1:28:05:: had elapsed so that there was little likelihood---likelihood%1:07:00:: of his returning for something he had forgotten , Harold---person%1:03:00:: went out into the hall---hall%1:06:03:: and stood looking into one room---room%1:06:00:: after another .
In the room---room%1:06:00:: next to theirs was a huge cradle---cradle%1:06:00:: , of mahogany---mahogany%1:20:02:: , ornately carved and decorated with gold leaf---gold_leaf%1:06:00:: .
It was the most important-looking cradle---cradle%1:06:00:: he had ever seen .
Then came their bathroom---bathroom%1:06:00:: , and then a bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: that , judging by the photographs---photograph%1:06:00:: on the walls---wall%1:06:00:: , must belong to Mme Cestre---person%1:03:00:: .
A young woman---young_woman%1:18:00:: who looked like Alix---person%1:03:00:: , with her two children---child%1:18:01:: .
Alix---person%1:03:00:: and Eugene---person%1:03:00:: on their wedding day---wedding_day%1:28:00:: .
Matching photographs---photograph%1:06:00:: in oval frames---frame%1:06:02:: of Mme Bonenfant---person%1:03:00:: and an elderly man---man%1:18:00:: who must be Alix---person%1:03:00:: 's grandfather---grandfather%1:18:00:: .
Mme Vienot---person%1:03:00:: , considerably younger and very different .
The schoolboy---schoolboy%1:18:00:: .
And a gray-haired man---man%1:18:00:: whose glance---glance%1:04:00:: - direct , lifelike , and mildly accusing - was contradicted by the gilt and black frame---frame%1:06:02:: .
It was the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of frame---frame%1:06:02:: that is only put around the photograph---photograph%1:06:00:: of a dead person---dead_person%1:18:00:: .
Professor Cestre---person%1:03:00:: , could it be ?
With the metal---metal%1:27:00:: shutters---shutter%1:06:00:: closed , the dining room---dining_room%1:06:00:: was so dark that it seemed still night---night%1:28:00:: in there .
One of the drawing-room---drawing_room%1:06:00:: shutters---shutter%1:06:00:: was partly open and he made out the shapes---shape%1:03:00:: of chairs---chair%1:06:00:: and sofas---sofa%1:06:00:: , which seemed to be upholstered in brown or russet---russet%1:06:00:: velvet---velvet%1:06:00:: .
The curtains---curtain%1:06:00:: were of the same material---material%1:06:00:: , and there were some big oil paintings---oil_painting%1:06:00:: - portraits in the style---style%1:09:00:: of Lancret---person%1:03:00:: and Boucher---person%1:03:00:: .
Though , taken individually , the big rooms---room%1:06:00:: were , or seemed to be , square---square%1:25:00:: , the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: as a whole---whole%1:09:00:: formed a triangle---triangle%1:25:00:: .
The apex---apex%1:15:00:: , the study---study%1:06:00:: where Eugene---person%1:03:00:: slept , was light and bright and airy and cheerful .
The window---window%1:06:00:: looked out on the Place Redoute---location%1:03:00:: - it was the only window---window%1:06:00:: of the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: that did .
Looking around slowly , he saw a marble---marble%1:27:00:: fireplace---fireplace%1:06:01:: , a desk---desk%1:06:00:: , a low bookcase---bookcase%1:06:00:: of mahogany---mahogany%1:20:02:: with criss-crossed brass---brass%1:27:00:: wire---wire%1:06:00:: instead of glass---glass%1:27:00:: panes---pane%1:06:00:: in the doors---door%1:06:00:: .
The daybed---daybed%1:06:01:: Eugene---person%1:03:00:: had slept in , made up now with its dark-brown velours---velours%1:06:00:: cover---cover%1:06:01:: and pillows---pillow%1:06:00:: .
The portable record player---record_player%1:06:00:: with a pile---pile%1:14:00:: of classical records---record%1:06:00:: beside it .
Beethoven---person%1:03:00:: 's Fifth was the one on top---top%1:15:00:: .
Music---music%1:10:00:: could not be Eugene---person%1:03:00:: 's passion---passion%1:09:00:: .
Besides , the records---record%1:06:00:: were dusty .
He tried the doors---door%1:06:00:: of the bookcase---bookcase%1:06:00:: .
The titles---title%1:10:00:: he could read easily through the criss-crossed wires---wire%1:06:00:: : works---work%1:06:00:: on theology---theology%1:09:01:: , astral physics---physics%1:09:00:: , history---history%1:28:00:: , biology---biology%1:09:00:: , political science---political_science%1:09:00:: .
No poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: .
No novels---novel%1:10:00:: .
He moved over to the desk---desk%1:06:00:: and stood looking at the papers---paper%1:27:00:: on it but not touching anything .
The clock---clock%1:06:00:: on the mantel piece---mantel%1:06:00:: was scandalized and ticked so loudly that he glanced at it over his shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: and then quickly left the room---room%1:06:00:: .
The concierge---concierge%1:18:00:: called out to them as they were passing through the foyer---foyer%1:06:00:: .
Her quarters---quarters%1:06:00:: were on the right---right%1:15:00:: as you walked into the building---building%1:06:00:: , and her small front room---front_room%1:06:00:: was clogged with heavy furniture---furniture%1:06:00:: - a big , round , oak---oak%1:20:02:: dining table---dining_table%1:06:00:: and chairs---chair%1:06:00:: , a buffet---buffet%1:06:00:: , with a row---row%1:14:00:: of unclaimed letters---letter%1:10:00:: inserted between the mirror---mirror%1:06:00:: and its frame---frame%1:06:02:: .
The suitcases---suitcase%1:06:00:: had come while they were out , and had been put in their room---room%1:06:00:: , the concierge---concierge%1:18:00:: said .
He waited until they were inside the elevator---elevator%1:06:00:: and then said : `` Now---now%1:28:00:: what do we do '' ?
`` Call the Vouillemont---person%1:03:00:: , I guess '' .
Rather than sit around waiting for the suitcases---suitcase%1:06:00:: to be delivered , they had gone sight-seeing---sightseeing%1:04:00:: .
They went to the Flea Market---flea_market%1:15:00:: , expecting to find the treasures---treasure%1:21:00:: of Europe---location%1:03:00:: , and found instead a duplication---duplication%1:06:00:: of that long double row---row%1:14:00:: of booths---booth%1:06:00:: in Tours---location%1:03:00:: .
Cheap clothing---clothing%1:06:00:: and junk---junk%1:27:00:: of every sort---sort%1:09:00:: , as far as the eye---eye%1:08:00:: could see .
Barbara---person%1:03:00:: bought some cotton---cotton%1:27:01:: aprons---apron%1:06:00:: , and Harold---person%1:03:00:: bought shoestrings---shoestring%1:06:00:: .
They had lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: at a sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: cafe---cafe%1:06:00:: overlooking the intersection---intersection%1:06:00:: of two broad , busy , unpicturesque streets---street%1:06:00:: , and coming home they got lost in the Metro---metro%1:06:00:: ; it took them over an hour---hour%1:28:00:: to get back to the station---station%1:06:00:: where they should have changed , in order to take the line---line%1:06:05:: that went to the Place Redoute---location%1:03:00:: .
It was the end---end%1:28:00:: of the afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: when he took the huge key---key%1:06:00:: out of his pocket---pocket%1:25:00:: and inserted it into the keyhole---keyhole%1:06:00:: .
When he opened the door---door%1:06:00:: , there stood Eugene---person%1:03:00:: , on his way---way%1:04:02:: out of the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: .
He was wearing sneakers---sneaker%1:06:00:: and shorts and an open-collared shirt---shirt%1:06:00:: , and in his hand---hand%1:08:00:: he carried a little black bag---bag%1:06:00:: .
Instead , they went on down the hall---hall%1:06:03:: to their room---room%1:06:00:: .
`` Do you think he could be having an affair---affair%1:26:00:: '' ?
Barbara---person%1:03:00:: asked , as they heard the front door---front_door%1:06:00:: close .
`` Oh no '' , Harold---person%1:03:00:: said , shocked .
`` Well , this is France---france%1:15:00:: , after all '' .
`` I know , but there must be some other explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: .
He 's probably spending the evening---evening%1:28:00:: with friends---friend%1:18:00:: '' .
`` And for that he needs a little bag---bag%1:06:00:: '' ?
They went shopping---shopping%1:04:00:: in the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: , and bought two loaves of bread---loaf_of_bread%1:13:00:: with the ration---ration%1:21:00:: coupons---coupon%1:10:00:: they had been given in Blois---location%1:03:00:: , and some cheese---cheese%1:13:00:: , and a dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: eggs---eggs%1:13:00:: , and a bag---bag%1:23:00:: of oranges---orange%1:13:00:: from a peddler---peddler%1:18:00:: in the Place Redoute---location%1:03:00:: - the first oranges---orange%1:13:00:: they had seen since they landed .
They had Vermouth---vermouth%1:13:00:: , sitting in front of a cafe---cafe%1:06:00:: .
When they got home---home%1:15:04:: Harold---person%1:03:00:: was grateful for the stillness---stillness%1:07:00:: in the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: , and thought how , under different circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: , they might have stayed on here , in these old-fashioned , high-ceilinged rooms---room%1:06:00:: that reminded him of the Irelands---person%1:03:00:: ' apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: in the East Eighties---location%1:03:00:: .
They could have been perfectly happy here for ten whole days---day%1:28:00:: .
He went down the hall---hall%1:06:03:: to Eugene---person%1:03:00:: 's bathroom---bathroom%1:06:00:: , to turn on the hot-water heater---hot-water_heater%1:06:00:: , and on the side---side%1:06:00:: of the tub---tub%1:06:01:: he saw a pair---pair%1:23:00:: of blue wool---wool%1:06:00:: swimming trunks---swimming_trunks%1:06:00:: .
He reached out and felt the bath towel---bath_towel%1:06:00:: hanging on the towel rack---towel_rack%1:06:00:: over the tub---tub%1:06:01:: .
He looked around the room---room%1:06:00:: and then called out :
Barbara---person%1:03:00:: asked , standing in the doorway---doorway%1:06:00:: .
`` I 've solved the mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: of the little bag---bag%1:06:00:: .
But where do people---people%1:14:00:: go swimming in Paris---location%1:03:00:: ?
That boat---boat%1:06:00:: in the river---river%1:17:00:: , maybe '' .
`` What boat---boat%1:06:00:: '' ?
`` There 's a big boat---boat%1:06:00:: anchored near the Place de la Concorde---location%1:03:00:: , with a swimming pool---swimming_pool%1:06:00:: in it - did n't you notice it ?
But if he has time---time%1:28:05:: to go swimming , he had time---time%1:28:05:: to be with us '' .
She looked at him in surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: .
`` I know '' , he said , reading her mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
`` It 's because we are in France---location%1:03:00:: '' , he said , `` and know so few people---people%1:14:00:: .
So something like this matters more than it would at home---home%1:15:02:: .
The tweed---tweed%1:06:00:: coat---coat%1:06:00:: , maybe .
The thing---thing%1:07:00:: about Eugene---person%1:03:00:: is that he 's very proud '' .
And the thing---thing%1:07:00:: about hurt feelings---feelings%1:12:00:: , the wet bathing suit---bathing_suit%1:06:00:: pointed out , is that the person---person%1:03:00:: who has them is not quite the innocent party---party%1:14:02:: he believes himself to be .
For instance - what about all those people---people%1:14:00:: Harold Rhodes---person%1:03:00:: went toward unhesitatingly , as if this were the one moment---moment%1:28:00:: they would ever have together , their one chance---chance%1:26:00:: of knowing each other ?
Fortunately , the embarrassing questions---question%1:10:00:: raised by objects---object%1:03:00:: do not need to be answered , or we would all have to go sleep in the open fields---field%1:15:00:: .
And in any case , answers---answer%1:10:00:: may clarify but they do not change anything .
He was in his mid fifties---mid-fifties%1:28:00:: at this time---time%1:28:00:: , long past the establishment---establishment%1:04:00:: of his name---name%1:26:00:: and the wish---wish%1:12:00:: to be lionized yet once again , and it was almost a decade---decade%1:28:00:: since he had sworn off lecturing---lecturing%1:04:00:: .
There was never a doubt---doubt%1:07:00:: any more how his structures---structure%1:06:00:: would be received ; it was always the same unqualified success---success%1:26:00:: now .
He could no longer build anything , whether a private residence---residence%1:06:01:: in his Pennsylvania---pennsylvania%1:15:00:: county---county%1:15:00:: or a church---church%1:06:00:: in Brazil---brazil%1:15:00:: , without it being obvious that he had done it , and while here and there he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique---technique%1:09:00:: , they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings---building%1:06:00:: that the public---public%1:14:00:: felt assured by its sense---sense%1:09:05:: of recognition---recognition%1:09:00:: after a time---time%1:28:00:: , a quality---quality%1:07:00:: of authentic uniqueness---uniqueness%1:07:00:: about them , which , once established by an artist---artist%1:18:00:: as his private vision---vision%1:09:04:: , is no longer disputable as to its other values---value%1:07:00:: .
Stowey Rummel---person%1:03:00:: was internationally famous , a crafter---crafter%1:18:00:: of a genuine Americana---americana%1:06:00:: in foreign eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , an original designer---designer%1:18:00:: whose inventive childishness---childishness%1:07:00:: with steel---steel%1:27:00:: and concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: was made even more believably sincere by his personality---personality%1:07:00:: .
He had lived for almost thirty years---year%1:28:01:: in this same stone---stone%1:27:00:: farmhouse---farmhouse%1:06:00:: with the same wife---wife%1:18:00:: , a remarkably childish thing---thing%1:26:00:: in itself ; he rose at half past six every morning---morning%1:28:00:: , made himself some French coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: , had his corn flakes---corn_flake%1:13:00:: and more coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: , smoked four cigarettes---cigarette%1:06:00:: while reading last Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: 's Herald Tribune and yesterday---yesterday%1:28:01:: 's Pittsburgh Gazette , then put on his high-topped farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: 's shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: and walked under a vine---vine%1:20:00:: bower---bower%1:06:00:: to his workshop---workshop%1:06:00:: .
This was an enormously long building---building%1:06:00:: whose walls---wall%1:06:00:: were made of rocks---rock%1:27:00:: , some of them brought home from every continent---continent%1:17:00:: during his six years---year%1:28:01:: as an oil geologist---oil_geologist%1:18:00:: .
The debris---debris%1:27:00:: of his other careers---career%1:04:00:: was piled everywhere ; a pile---pile%1:14:00:: of wire---wire%1:06:00:: cages---cage%1:06:00:: for mice---mouse%1:05:00:: from his time---time%1:28:00:: as a geneticist---geneticist%1:18:00:: and a microscope---microscope%1:06:00:: lying on its side---side%1:06:00:: on the window sill---windowsill%1:06:00:: , vertical steel---steel%1:27:00:: columns---column%1:06:00:: wired for support---support%1:04:01:: to the open ceiling---ceiling%1:06:00:: beams---beam%1:06:00:: with spidery steel---steel%1:27:00:: cantilevers---cantilever%1:06:00:: jutting out into the air---air%1:15:00:: , masonry---masonry%1:06:00:: constructions---construction%1:06:00:: on the floor---floor%1:06:00:: from the time---time%1:28:00:: he was inventing his disastrous fireplace---fireplace%1:06:01:: whose smoke---smoke%1:19:00:: would pass through a whole house---house%1:06:00:: , visible all the way up through wire---wire%1:06:00:: gratings---grating%1:06:00:: on each floor---floor%1:06:01:: .
His files---file%1:06:01:: , desk---desk%1:06:00:: , drafting board---drafting_board%1:06:00:: and a high stool---stool%1:06:00:: formed the only clean island---island%1:06:00:: in the chaos---chaos%1:26:00:: .
Everywhere else his ideas---idea%1:09:00:: lay or hung in visible form---form%1:09:00:: : his models---model%1:06:00:: , drawings---drawing%1:06:00:: , ten foot---foot%1:23:00:: canvases---canvas%1:06:04:: in monochromes---monochrome%1:06:01:: from his painting---painting%1:04:00:: days---day%1:28:03:: , and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books---book%1:06:00:: that looked as though their insides---inside%1:15:01:: had been ransacked by a maniac---maniac%1:18:00:: .
Bicycle---bicycle%1:06:00:: gear-sets---gearset%1:06:00:: he had once used as the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of the design---design%1:09:02:: for the Camden Cycly Company---group%1:03:00:: plant---plant%1:06:01:: hung on a rope---rope%1:06:00:: in one corner---corner%1:06:02:: , and over his desk---desk%1:06:00:: , next to several old and dusty hats---hat%1:06:00:: , was a clean pair---pair%1:14:01:: of roller skates---roller_skate%1:06:00:: which he occasionally used up and down front---front%1:15:00:: of his house---house%1:06:00:: .
He worked standing , with his left---left%1:08:00:: hand---hand%1:08:00:: in his pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: as though he were merely stopping for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: , sketching with the surprised stare---stare%1:04:00:: of one who was watching another person---person%1:03:00:: 's hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
Sometimes he would grunt softly to some invisible onlooker---onlooker%1:18:00:: beside him , sometimes he would look stern and moralistic as his pencil---pencil%1:06:00:: did what he disapproved .
It all seemed - if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows---window%1:06:00:: - as though this broken nosed man---man%1:18:00:: with the muscular arms---arm%1:08:00:: and wrestler---wrestler%1:18:00:: 's neck---neck%1:08:00:: was merely the caretaker---caretaker%1:18:00:: trying his hand---hand%1:09:00:: at the boss---boss%1:18:00:: 's work---work%1:04:01:: .
This air---air%1:07:00:: of disengagement---disengagement%1:04:02:: carried over to his apparent attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: toward his things---things%1:21:00:: , and people---people%1:14:00:: often mistook it for boredom---boredom%1:12:00:: in him or a surrender---surrender%1:12:00:: to repetitious routine---routine%1:04:00:: .
But he was not bored at all ; he had found his style---style%1:07:00:: quite early in his career---career%1:04:01:: and he thought it quite wonderful that the world---world%1:14:02:: admired it , and he could not imagine why he should alter it .
There are , after all , fortunate souls---soul%1:03:00:: who hear everything , but only know how to listen to what is good for them , and Stowey---person%1:03:00:: was , as things---thing%1:11:00:: go , a fortunate man---man%1:18:00:: .
He left his home---home%1:15:04:: the day---day%1:28:00:: after New Year---new_year's_day%1:28:00:: 's wearing a mackinaw---mackinaw%1:06:03:: and sheepskin---sheepskin%1:27:00:: mittens and without a hat---hat%1:06:00:: .
He would wear this same costume---costume%1:06:02:: in Florida---florida%1:15:00:: , despite his wife---wife%1:18:00:: Cleota---person%1:03:00:: 's reminders---reminder%1:10:00:: over the past five days---day%1:28:00:: that he must take some cool clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: with him .
So they parted when she was in an impatient humor---humor%1:12:00:: .
When he was bent over behind the wheel---wheel%1:06:05:: of the station wagon---station_wagon%1:06:00:: , feeling in his trouser cuffs---trouser_cuff%1:06:00:: for the ignition key---ignition_key%1:06:00:: which he had dropped a moment---moment%1:28:01:: before , she came out of the house---house%1:06:00:: with an enormous Rumanian shawl---shawl%1:06:00:: over her head---head%1:08:00:: , which she had bought in that country---country%1:15:00:: during one of their trips---trip%1:04:00:: abroad , and handed him a clean handkerchief---handkerchief%1:06:00:: through the window---window%1:06:01:: .
Finding the key---key%1:06:00:: under his shoe---shoe%1:06:00:: , he started the engine---engine%1:06:00:: , and while it warmed up he turned to her standing there in the dripping fog---fog%1:19:00:: , and said , `` Defrost the refrigerator---refrigerator%1:06:00:: '' .
He saw the surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: in her face---face%1:07:00:: , and laughed as though it were the funniest expression---expression%1:07:00:: he had ever seen .
He had a deep voice---voice%1:07:00:: which was full of good food---food%1:03:00:: she had cooked , and good humor---good_humor%1:12:00:: ; an explosive laugh---laugh%1:10:00:: which always carried everything before it .
He would settle himself into his seat---seat%1:06:01:: to laugh---laugh%1:10:00:: .
And she was made to fall in love with him again there in the rutted dirt---dirt%1:27:01:: driveway---driveway%1:06:00:: standing in the cold fog---fog%1:19:00:: , mad as she was at his going away---going_away%1:04:00:: when he really did n't have to , mad at their both got older in a life---life%1:28:00:: that seemed to have taken no more than a week---week%1:28:00:: to go by .
She was forty-nine at this time---time%1:28:00:: , a lanky woman---woman%1:18:00:: of breeding---breeding%1:07:03:: with an austere , narrow face---face%1:08:00:: which had the distinction---distinction%1:07:01:: of a steeple---steeple%1:06:00:: or some architecture---architecture%1:06:00:: that had been designed long ago for a stubborn sort---sort%1:09:00:: of prayer---prayer%1:04:00:: .
Her eyebrows---eyebrow%1:08:00:: were definite and heavy and formed two lines---line%1:10:01:: moving upward toward a high forehead---forehead%1:08:00:: and a great head---head_of_hair%1:08:00:: of brown hair that fell to her shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
There was an air---air%1:07:00:: of blindness---blindness%1:26:00:: in her gray eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , the startled horse---horse%1:05:00:: look---look%1:07:01:: that ultimately comes to some women---woman%1:18:00:: who are born at the end---end%1:15:00:: of an ancestral line---line%1:14:00:: long since divorced from money-making---moneymaking%1:04:00:: and which , besides , has kept its estate---estate%1:21:02:: intact .
She was personally sloppy , and when she had colds---cold%1:26:00:: would blow her nose---nose%1:08:00:: in the same handkerchief---handkerchief%1:06:00:: all day---day%1:28:02:: and keep it , soaking wet , dangling from her waist---waist%1:08:00:: , and when she gardened she would eat dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: with dirt---dirt%1:26:00:: on her calves---calf%1:08:00:: .
But just when she seemed to have sunk into some depravity---depravity%1:07:00:: of peasanthood she would disappear and come down bathed , brushed , and taking breaths of air---air%1:27:00:: , and even with her broken nails---nail%1:08:00:: her hands---hand%1:08:00:: would come to rest on a table---table%1:06:01:: or a leaf---leaf%1:20:00:: with a thoughtless delicacy---delicacy%1:07:00:: , a grace---grace%1:07:01:: of history---history%1:28:00:: , so to speak , and for an instant---instant%1:28:01:: one saw how ferociously proud she was and adamant on certain questions---question%1:10:01:: of personal value---value%1:07:00:: .
She even spoke differently when she was clean , and she was clean now for his departure---departure%1:04:00:: and her voice---voice%1:07:00:: clear and rather sharp .
`` Now drive carefully , for God's sake '' ! she called , trying to attain a half humorous resentment---resentment%1:12:00:: at his departure---departure%1:04:00:: .
But he did not notice , and was already backing the car---car%1:06:00:: down to the road---road%1:06:00:: , saying `` Toot-toot '' ! to the stump---stump%1:20:00:: of a tree---tree%1:20:00:: as he passed it , the same stump---stump%1:20:00:: which had impaled the car---car%1:06:00:: of many a guest---guest%1:18:00:: in the past thirty years---year%1:28:01:: and which he refused to have removed .
She stood clutching her shawl---shawl%1:06:00:: around her shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: until he had swung the car---car%1:06:00:: onto the road---road%1:06:00:: .
Then , when he had it pointed down the hill---hill%1:17:00:: , he stopped to gaze at her through the window---window%1:06:01:: .
She had begun to turn back toward the house---house%1:06:00:: , but his look---look%1:04:00:: caught her and she stood still , waiting there for what his expression---expression%1:07:00:: indicated would be a serious word of farewell---word_of_farewell%1:10:00:: .
He looked at her out of himself , she thought , as he did only for an instant---instant%1:28:01:: at a time , the look---look%1:07:01:: which always surprised her even now when his uncombable hair---hair%1:08:00:: was yellowing a little and his breath---breath%1:27:00:: came hard through his nicotine---nicotine%1:27:00:: choked lungs---lung%1:08:00:: , the look---look%1:07:01:: of the gaunt youth---youth%1:18:00:: she had suddenly found herself staring at in the Tate Gallery---group%1:03:00:: on a Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: once .
Now she kept herself protectively ready to laugh again and sure enough he pointed at her with his index finger---index_finger%1:08:00:: and said `` Toot '' ! once more and roared off into the fog---fog%1:19:00:: , his foot---foot%1:08:01:: evidently surprising him with the suddenness---suddenness%1:07:00:: with which it pressed the accelerator---accelerator%1:06:00:: , just as his hand---hand%1:08:00:: did when he worked .
She walked back to the house---house%1:06:00:: and entered , feeling herself returning , sensing---sensing%1:09:00:: some kind---kind%1:09:00:: of opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: in the empty building---building%1:06:00:: .
There is a death---death%1:28:00:: in all partings---parting%1:04:00:: , she knew , and promptly put it out of her mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
She enjoyed great parties---party%1:14:00:: when she would sit up talking and dancing and drinking all night---night%1:28:00:: , but it always seemed to her that being alone , especially alone in her house---house%1:06:00:: , was the realest part---part%1:24:00:: of life---life%1:09:00:: .
Now she could let out the three parakeets---parakeet%1:05:00:: without fear they would be stepped on or that Stowey---person%1:03:00:: would let them out one of the doors---door%1:06:01:: ; she could dust the plants---plant%1:03:00:: , then break off suddenly and pick up an old novel---novel%1:10:00:: and read from the middle---middle%1:15:00:: on ; improvise cha-chas---cha-cha%1:04:00:: on the harp---harp%1:06:00:: ; and finally , the best part---part%1:24:00:: of all , simply sit at the plank---plank%1:27:00:: table---table%1:06:01:: in the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: with a bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: of wine---wine%1:13:00:: and the newspapers---newspaper%1:10:00:: , reading the ads---ad%1:10:00:: as well as the news---news%1:10:01:: , registering nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: on her mind---mind%1:09:00:: but letting her soul---soul%1:18:00:: suspend itself above all wishing---wishing%1:12:00:: and desire---desire%1:12:00:: .
She did this now , comfortably aware of the mist---mist%1:19:00:: running down the windows---window%1:06:00:: , of the silence---silence%1:07:00:: outside , of the dark afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: it was getting to be .
She fell asleep leaning on her hand---hand%1:08:00:: , hearing the house---house%1:06:00:: creaking as though it were a living a private life---life%1:26:00:: of its own these two hundred years---year%1:28:01:: , hearing the birds---bird%1:05:00:: rustling in their cages---cage%1:06:00:: and the occasional whirring---whirring%1:11:00:: of wings---wing%1:05:00:: as one of them landed on the table---table%1:06:01:: and walked across the newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: to perch in the crook---crook%1:25:00:: of her arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
Every few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: she would awaken for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: to review things---thing%1:09:02:: : Stowey---person%1:03:00:: , yes , was on his way---way%1:04:02:: south , and the two boys---boy%1:18:03:: were away in school---school%1:14:00:: , and nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: was burning on the stove---stove%1:06:01:: , and Lucretia---person%1:03:00:: was coming for dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: and bringing three guests---guest%1:18:00:: of hers .
Then she fell asleep again as suddenly as a person---person%1:03:00:: with fever---fever%1:26:00:: , and when she awoke it was dark outside and the clarity---clarity%1:07:00:: was back in her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
She stood up , smoothing her hair---hair%1:08:00:: down , straightening her clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: , feeling a thankfulness---thankfulness%1:12:00:: for the enveloping darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: outside , and , above everything else , for the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of the need---need%1:26:00:: to answer , to respond , to be aware even of Stowey---person%1:03:00:: coming in or going out , and yet , now that she was beginning to cook , she glimpsed a future---future%1:28:00:: without him , a future---future%1:28:00:: alone like this , and the pain---pain%1:12:00:: made her head---head%1:08:00:: writhe , and in a moment she found it hard to wait for Lucretia---person%1:03:00:: to come with her guests---guest%1:18:00:: .
She went into the living room---living_room%1:06:00:: and turned on three lamps---lamp%1:06:00:: , then back into the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: where she turned on the ceiling---ceiling%1:06:00:: light---light%1:06:00:: and the switch---switch%1:06:01:: that lit the floods---flood%1:06:00:: on the barn---barn%1:06:00:: , illuminating the driveway---driveway%1:06:00:: .
They were both so young , after all , so unready for any final parting---parting%1:04:00:: .
How could it have been thirty years---year%1:28:01:: already , she wondered ?
But yes , nineteen---nineteen%1:23:00:: plus thirty---thirty%1:23:00:: was forty-nine , and she was forty-nine and she had been married at nineteen---nineteen%1:23:00:: .
She stood still over the leg of lamb---leg_of_lamb%1:13:00:: , rubbing herbs---herb%1:13:00:: into it , quite suddenly conscious of a nausea---nausea%1:26:00:: in her stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: and a feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: of wrath---wrath%1:12:00:: , a sensation---sensation%1:09:00:: of violence---violence%1:04:01:: that started her shivering---shivering%1:26:00:: .
The popularity---popularity%1:07:00:: of folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: in America---america%1:15:00:: stands in direct proportion---proportion%1:24:00:: to the popularity---popularity%1:07:00:: of nationalism---nationalism%1:07:00:: in America---america%1:15:00:: .
And the emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: on nationalism---nationalism%1:07:00:: in America---america%1:15:00:: is in proportion to the growth---growth%1:22:02:: of American influence---influence%1:09:00:: across the world---world%1:17:00:: .
Thus , if we are to observe American folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: in the twentieth century---century%1:28:00:: , we will do well to establish the relationships---relationship%1:24:00:: between folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: , nationalism---nationalism%1:07:00:: and imperialism---imperialism%1:10:00:: at the outset---outset%1:28:00:: .
Historians---historian%1:18:00:: have come to recognize two cardinal facts---fact%1:09:01:: concerning nationalism---nationalism%1:07:00:: and international influence---influence%1:09:00:: .
1 ) Every age---age%1:28:02:: rewrites the events---event%1:03:00:: of its history---history%1:28:00:: in terms of what should have been , creating legends---legend%1:10:01:: about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs---belief%1:09:00:: and excuse contemporary actions---action%1:04:02:: .
What actually occurred in the past---past%1:28:00:: is seldom as important as what a given generation---generation%1:14:01:: feels must have occurred .
2 ) As a country---country%1:14:00:: superimposes its cultural and political attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: on others , it searches its heritage---heritage%1:09:00:: in hopes---hope%1:12:01:: of justifying its aggressiveness---aggressiveness%1:12:00:: .
Its folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: and legend---legend%1:10:01:: , usually disguised as history---history%1:09:01:: , are allowed to account for group actions---group_action%1:04:00:: , to provide a focal point---focal_point%1:19:00:: for group---group%1:03:00:: loyalty---loyalty%1:07:00:: , and to become a cohesive force---force%1:07:01:: for national identification .
One can apply these facts---fact%1:09:01:: to Britain---britain%1:15:00:: in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries---century%1:28:00:: as she spread her dominion---dominion%1:26:00:: over palm and pine , and they can be applied again to the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: in more recent years---year%1:28:01:: .
The popularity---popularity%1:07:00:: of local color---color%1:07:03:: literature---literature%1:10:00:: before the Spanish-American War---spanish-american_war%1:04:00:: , the steady currency---currency%1:07:02:: of the Lincoln---lincoln%1:18:00:: myth---myth%1:10:00:: , the increased emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: on the frontier west---west%1:15:01:: in our mass media are cases in point---case_in_point%1:09:00:: .
Nor is it an accident---accident%1:11:00:: that baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: , growing into the national game---game%1:04:01:: in the last 75 years---year%1:28:01:: , has become a microcosm---microcosm%1:09:00:: of American life---life%1:26:01:: , that learned societies---society%1:14:01:: such as the American Folklore Society---group%1:03:00:: and the American Historical Association---group%1:03:00:: were founded in the 1880's , or that courses---course%1:04:01:: in American literature---literature%1:10:00:: , American civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: , American anything have swept our school---school%1:14:00:: and college---college%1:14:00:: curricula---curriculum%1:10:00:: .
Of course , nationalism---nationalism%1:09:00:: has really outlived its usefulness---usefulness%1:07:00:: in a country---country%1:14:00:: as world oriented as ours , and its continued existence---existence%1:26:00:: reflects one of the major culture---culture%1:14:00:: lags---lag%1:04:00:: of the twentieth century---century%1:28:00:: United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
Yet nationalism---nationalism%1:09:00:: has lost few of its charms for the historian , writer or man in the street .
Yet nationalism---nationalism%1:07:00:: has lost few of its charms---charm%1:07:00:: for the historian---historian%1:18:00:: , writer---writer%1:18:00:: or man in the street---man_in_the_street%1:18:00:: .
It is an understandable paradox---paradox%1:10:00:: that most American history---history%1:09:01:: and most American literature---literature%1:10:00:: is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view---point_of_view%1:09:00:: at the very time---time%1:28:00:: America---america%1:15:00:: is spreading her dominion---dominion%1:26:00:: over palm and pine .
After all , the average American---american%1:18:00:: as he lies and waits for the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: in Korea---korea%1:15:00:: or as she scans the newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: in some vain hope---hope%1:12:01:: of personal contact---contact%1:04:02:: with the front---front%1:15:01:: is unconcerned that his or her plight---plight%1:26:00:: is the result---result%1:19:00:: of a complex---complex%1:09:00:: of personal , economic and governmental actions---action%1:04:02:: far beyond the normal citizen---citizen%1:18:00:: 's comprehension---comprehension%1:09:00:: and control---control%1:07:00:: .
Anyone 's identification with an international struggle---struggle%1:04:02:: , whether warlike or peaceful , requires absurd oversimplification---oversimplification%1:04:00:: and intense emotional involvement---involvement%1:09:00:: .
Such identification comes for each group---group%1:03:00:: in each crisis---crisis%1:26:00:: by rewriting history---history%1:28:00:: into legend---legend%1:10:01:: and developing appropriate national heroes---hero%1:18:00:: .
In America---america%1:15:00:: , such self-deception---self-deception%1:09:00:: has served a particularly useful purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: .
A heterogeneous people---people%1:14:01:: have needed it to attain an element---element%1:09:00:: of cultural and political cohesion---cohesion%1:26:00:: in a new and ever changing land---land%1:14:00:: .
But we must never forget , most of the appropriate heroes---hero%1:18:00:: and their legends---legend%1:10:01:: were created overnight , to answer immediate needs---need%1:26:00:: , almost always with conscious aims---aim%1:09:00:: and ends---end%1:09:02:: .
Parson Weems---person%1:03:00:: 's George Washington---george_washington%1:18:00:: became the symbol---symbol%1:09:00:: of honesty---honesty%1:07:00:: and the father---father%1:18:03:: image---image%1:09:02:: of the uniting States---state%1:15:01:: .
Abraham Lincoln---abraham_lincoln%1:18:00:: emerged as an incarnation---incarnation%1:18:00:: of the national Constitution---constitution%1:10:00:: .
Robert E. Lee represented the dignity---dignity%1:07:00:: needed by a rebelling confederacy---confederacy%1:14:00:: .
And their roles---role%1:04:00:: are paralleled by those of Patrick Henry---person%1:03:00:: , Nathan Hale---person%1:03:00:: , Andrew Jackson---person%1:03:00:: , Davy Crockett---person%1:03:00:: , Theodore Roosevelt---person%1:03:00:: and many , many more .
Therefore , the scholar---scholar%1:18:00:: , as he looks at our national folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: of the last 60 years---year%1:28:01:: , will be mindful of two facts---fact%1:09:01:: .
1 ) Most of the legends---legend%1:10:01:: that are created to fan the fires of patriotism---patriotism%1:07:00:: are essentially propagandistic and are not folk---folk%1:14:00:: legends---legend%1:10:01:: at all .
2 ) The concept---concept%1:09:00:: that an `` American national folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: '' exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend---legend%1:10:01:: .
Folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: is individually created art---art%1:06:00:: that a homogeneous group---group%1:03:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: preserve , vary and recreate through oral transmission---transmission%1:10:00:: .
It has come to mean myths---myth%1:10:00:: , legends---legend%1:10:01:: , tales---tale%1:10:00:: , songs---song%1:10:00:: , proverbs---proverb%1:10:00:: , riddles---riddle%1:10:00:: , superstitions---superstition%1:09:00:: , rhymes---rhyme%1:10:01:: and such literary forms---form%1:09:01:: of expression---expression%1:10:04:: .
Related to written literature---literature%1:10:00:: , and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form---form%1:09:01:: , it loses its vitality---vitality%1:07:01:: when transcribed or removed from its oral existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies---society%1:14:00:: , it assumes a role---role%1:04:00:: of true cultural importance---importance%1:07:00:: only in the latter .
In its propagandistic and commercial haste---haste%1:07:00:: to discover our folk---folk%1:14:00:: heritage---heritage%1:09:00:: , the public---public%1:14:00:: has remained ignorant of definitions---definition%1:10:00:: such as this .
Enthusiastically , Americans---american%1:18:00:: have swept subliterary and bogus materials---material%1:10:00:: like Paul Bunyan---person%1:03:00:: tales---tale%1:10:00:: , Abe Lincoln---abraham_lincoln%1:18:00:: anecdotes---anecdote%1:10:00:: and labor union---labor_union%1:14:00:: songs---song%1:10:00:: up as true products---product%1:06:00:: of our American oral tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: .
Nor have we remembered that in the melting pot---melting_pot%1:15:00:: of America---america%1:15:00:: the hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of isolated and semi isolated ethnic , regional and occupational groups---group%1:03:00:: did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit---unit%1:14:00:: until long after education---education%1:09:00:: and industrialization---industrialization%1:04:00:: had caused them to cast oral tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: aside as a means---means%1:04:00:: of carrying culturally significant material---material%1:10:00:: .
Naturally , such scholarly facts---fact%1:10:01:: are of little concern---concern%1:12:01:: to the man---man%1:18:04:: trying to make money---money%1:21:00:: or fan patriotism---patriotism%1:07:00:: by means---means%1:04:00:: of folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: .
That much---much%1:23:00:: of what he calls folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: is the result---result%1:19:00:: of beliefs---belief%1:09:00:: carefully sown among the people---people%1:14:01:: with the conscious aim---aim%1:09:00:: of producing a desired mass emotional reaction---reaction%1:09:00:: to a particular situation---situation%1:26:00:: or set---set%1:14:00:: of situations---situation%1:26:00:: is irrelevant .
As long as his material---material%1:10:00:: is Americana---americana%1:06:00:: , can in some way be ascribed to the masses---masses%1:14:00:: and appears `` democratic '' to his audience---audience%1:14:01:: , he remains satisfied .
From all this we can now see that two streams---stream%1:14:00:: of development---development%1:22:02:: run through the history---history%1:10:00:: of twentieth century---century%1:28:00:: American folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: .
On the one side---side%1:14:00:: we have the university---university%1:14:00:: professors---professor%1:18:00:: and their students---student%1:18:00:: , trained in Teutonic methods---method%1:09:00:: of research---research%1:09:00:: , who have sought out , collected and studied the true products---product%1:06:00:: of the oral traditions---tradition%1:09:01:: of the ethnic , regional and occupational groups---group%1:03:00:: that make up this nation---nation%1:14:01:: .
On the other we have the flag wavers---flag-waver%1:18:00:: and the national sentimentalists---sentimentalist%1:18:00:: who have been willing to use any patriotic , `` frontier western---western%1:10:00:: '' or colonial material---material%1:10:00:: willy-nilly .
Unfortunately , few of the artists---artist%1:18:00:: ( writers---writer%1:18:00:: , movie---movie%1:10:00:: producers---producer%1:18:02:: , dramatists---dramatist%1:18:00:: and musicians---musician%1:18:01:: ) who have used American folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: since 1900 have known enough---enough%1:23:00:: to distinguish between the two streams---stream%1:14:00:: even in the most general of ways---way%1:07:01:: .
Unfortunately , few of the artists ( writers , movie producers , dramatists and musicians---musician%1:18:00:: ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways .
After all , the field---field%1:09:00:: is large , difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates---undergraduate%1:18:00:: .
In addition , this country---country%1:14:00:: has been settled by many peoples---people%1:14:00:: of many heritages---heritage%1:09:00:: and their lore---lore%1:09:00:: has become acculturated slowly , in an age---age%1:28:02:: of print---print%1:10:00:: and easy communication---communication%1:10:01:: , within an ever expanding and changing society---society%1:14:00:: .
The problems---problem%1:26:00:: confuse even the experts---expert%1:18:00:: .
For that matter , the experts---expert%1:18:00:: themselves are a mixed breed .
Anthropologists---anthropologist%1:18:00:: , housewives---housewife%1:18:00:: , historians---historian%1:18:00:: and such by profession---profession%1:04:00:: , they approach their discipline---discipline%1:09:00:: as amateurs---amateur%1:18:00:: , collectors---collector%1:18:01:: , commercial propagandists---propagandist%1:18:00:: , analysts---analyst%1:18:00:: or some combination---combination%1:14:00:: of the four .
They have widely varying backgrounds---background%1:07:00:: and aims---aim%1:09:00:: .
They have little `` esprit de corps---esprit_de_corps%1:07:00:: '' .
The outlook---outlook%1:09:00:: for the amateur---amateur%1:18:00:: , for instance , is usually dependent on his fondness---fondness%1:12:01:: for local history---history%1:10:00:: or for the picturesque .
His love---love%1:12:00:: of folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: has romanticism---romanticism%1:07:00:: in it , and he does n't care much about the dollar sign---dollar_sign%1:10:01:: or the footnote---footnote%1:10:00:: .
Folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: is his hobby---hobby%1:04:00:: , and he , all too rightly , wishes it to remain as such .
The amateur---amateur%1:18:00:: is closely related to the collector---collector%1:18:01:: , who is actually no more than the amateur---amateur%1:18:00:: who has taken to the field---field%1:15:01:: .
The collector---collector%1:18:01:: enjoys the contact---contact%1:04:02:: with rural life---life%1:26:01:: ; he hunts folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: for the very `` field and stream '' reasons---reason%1:16:00:: that many persons---person%1:03:00:: hunt game---game%1:05:00:: ; and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: of what he has located .
Fundamentally , both these types---type%1:18:00:: , the amateur---amateur%1:18:00:: and the collector---collector%1:18:01:: , are uncritical and many of them do n't distinguish well between real folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: and bogus material---material%1:10:00:: .
Fundamentally , both these types---type%1:09:00:: , the amateur and the collector , are uncritical and many of them do n't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material .
But there are also the commercial propagandists---propagandist%1:18:00:: and the analysts---analyst%1:18:00:: - one dominated by money---money%1:21:00:: , the other by nineteenth century---century%1:28:00:: German scholarship---scholarship%1:09:00:: .
Both are primarily concerned with the uses---use%1:07:00:: that can be made of the material---material%1:10:00:: that the collector---collector%1:18:01:: has found .
Both shudder at the thought---thought%1:09:01:: of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system---sewage_system%1:06:00:: and the electric light---light%1:06:00:: lines---line%1:06:01:: .
The commercial propagandist---propagandist%1:18:00:: , who can n't afford to be critical , gets along well with the amateur---amateur%1:18:00:: , from whom he feeds , but he frequently steps on the analyst---analyst%1:18:00:: 's toes by refusing to keep his material---material%1:10:00:: genuine .
His standards---standard%1:09:00:: are , of course , completely foreign to those of the analyst---analyst%1:18:00:: .
To both the amateur---amateur%1:18:00:: and the commercial progandist---propagandist%1:18:00:: the analyst---analyst%1:18:00:: lacks a soul---soul%1:12:00:: , lacks appreciation---appreciation%1:09:01:: with his endless probings and classifications---classification%1:04:00:: .
Dominated by the vicious circle---vicious_circle%1:22:00:: of the university---university%1:14:00:: promotion system---promotion_system%1:09:00:: , the analyst---analyst%1:18:00:: looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups---group%1:03:00:: , although he cannot deny his debt---debt%1:26:00:: to the collector---collector%1:18:01:: .
The knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: that most Americans---american%1:18:00:: have of folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: comes through contact---contact%1:04:02:: with commercial propagandists---propagandist%1:18:00:: and a few energetic amateurs---amateur%1:18:00:: and collectors---collector%1:18:01:: .
The work---work%1:06:00:: done by the analysts---analyst%1:18:00:: , the men---man%1:18:04:: who really know what folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: is all about , has no more appeal---appeal%1:07:00:: than any other work---work%1:06:00:: of a truly scientific sort---sort%1:09:00:: and reaches a limited , learned audience---audience%1:14:01:: .
Publishers---publisher%1:14:00:: want books---book%1:10:00:: that will sell , recording studios---recording_studio%1:06:00:: want discs---disc%1:06:01:: that will not seem strange to ears---ear%1:09:00:: used to hillbilly---hillbilly_music%1:10:00:: and jazz music , grade---grade_school%1:14:00:: and high schools---high_school%1:14:00:: want quaint , but moral , material---material%1:10:00:: .
The analyst---analyst%1:18:00:: is apt to be too honest to fit in .
As a result---result%1:11:00:: , most people---people%1:14:00:: do n't have more than a vague idea---idea%1:09:00:: what folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: actually is ; they see it as a potpourri---potpourri%1:14:00:: of charming , moral legends---legend%1:10:01:: and patriotic anecdotes---anecdote%1:10:00:: , with a superstition---superstition%1:09:00:: or remedy---remedy%1:06:00:: thrown in here and there .
And so well is such ignorance---ignorance%1:09:00:: preserved by the amateur---amateur%1:18:00:: and the money-maker---moneymaker%1:18:00:: that even at the college level---college_level%1:26:00:: most of the hundred odd folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: courses---course%1:04:01:: given in the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: survive on sentiment---sentiment%1:12:00:: and nationalism---nationalism%1:07:00:: alone .
If one wishes to discuss a literary figure---figure%1:18:00:: who uses folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: in his work---work%1:06:00:: , the first thing---thing%1:09:00:: he must realize is that the literary figure---figure%1:18:00:: is probably part---part%1:24:00:: of this ignorant American public---public%1:14:00:: .
And while every writer---writer%1:18:00:: must be dealt with as a special case---case%1:10:02:: , the interested student---student%1:18:00:: will want to ask himself a number---number%1:07:00:: of questions---question%1:10:00:: about each .
Does the writer---writer%1:18:00:: know the difference---difference%1:07:00:: between an `` ersatz '' ballad---ballad%1:10:00:: or tall tale---tall_tale%1:10:00:: and a true product---product%1:06:00:: of the folk---folk%1:14:00:: ?
When the writer---writer%1:18:00:: uses material---material%1:10:00:: does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect---effect%1:09:00:: or does he leave it pure ?
Is the writer---writer%1:18:00:: propagandistic ?
Is he swept away by sentiment---sentiment%1:12:00:: and nostalgia---nostalgia%1:12:00:: for an America---america%1:15:00:: that was ?
Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs---spring%1:15:00:: of American attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: and culture---culture%1:09:01:: regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be ?
When he gets the answers---answer%1:10:01:: to his questions---question%1:10:00:: he will be discouraged .
In the first place , a good many writers---writer%1:18:00:: who are said to use folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: , do not , unless one counts an occasional superstition---superstition%1:09:00:: or tale---tale%1:10:00:: .
Robert Frost---person%1:03:00:: , for instance , writes about rural life---life%1:26:01:: in New England---new_england%1:15:00:: , but he does not include any significant amount---amount%1:07:00:: of folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: in his poems---poem%1:10:00:: .
This has not , however , prevented publishers---publisher%1:14:00:: from labeling him a `` folk poet---folk_poet%1:18:00:: '' , simply because he is a rural one .
In the second place---place%1:09:00:: , a large number---large_number%1:23:00:: of writers---writer%1:18:00:: , making a more direct claim---claim%1:07:02:: than Frost---person%1:03:00:: to being `` folk writers---folk_writer%1:18:00:: '' of one sort---sort%1:09:00:: or another , clearly make no distinctions---distinction%1:09:00:: between genuine and bogus material---material%1:10:00:: .
Stephen Vincent Benet---person%1:03:00:: 's John Brown's Body comes immediately to mind---mind%1:09:01:: in this connection---connection%1:24:00:: , as does John Steinbeck---person%1:03:00:: 's The Grapes of Wrath and Carl Sandburg---person%1:03:00:: 's The People, Yes .
The last two writers---writer%1:18:00:: introduce strong political bias---bias%1:09:00:: into their works---work%1:06:00:: , and not unlike the union---union%1:14:01:: leaders---leaders%1:14:00:: that we will discuss soon , see folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: as a reservoir---reservoir%1:23:00:: of protest---protest%1:10:00:: by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass---mass%1:14:01:: .
Folklore---folklore%1:09:00:: , as used by such writers---writer%1:18:00:: , really reflects images---image%1:09:00:: engraved into it by the very person---person%1:03:00:: using it .
The folk---folk%1:14:00:: are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation---nation%1:14:01:: or political attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: .
In fact , there is much evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: to indicate they do n't care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional , ethnic and occupational limits---limit%1:07:00:: .
Nevertheless , with a reading---reading%1:09:00:: public---public%1:14:01:: that longs for `` the good old days '' and with an awareness---awareness%1:09:00:: of our expanding international interests---interest%1:04:01:: , it is easy for the Benets---person%1:03:00:: to obtain a magnified position---position%1:26:00:: in literature---literature%1:04:00:: by use---use%1:04:00:: of all sorts---sort%1:09:00:: of Americana---americana%1:06:00:: , real or fake , and it is easy for the Steinbecks---person%1:03:00:: and Sandburgs---person%1:03:00:: to support their messages---message%1:10:00:: of reform---reform%1:04:00:: by reading messages---message%1:10:00:: of reform---reform%1:04:00:: into the minds---mind%1:09:00:: of the folk---folk%1:14:00:: .
The bronchus---bronchus%1:08:00:: and pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: in this lung---lung%1:08:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: maintain a close relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: throughout .
The pulmonary vein---pulmonary_vein%1:08:00:: , however , without the limiting supportive tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: septa---septum%1:08:00:: as in type---type%1:09:00:: 1 , , follows a more direct path---path%1:15:00:: to the hilum---hilum%1:08:00:: and does not maintain this close relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: ( figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 8 , 22 ) .
Another marked difference---difference%1:07:00:: is noted here .
The pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: , in addition to supplying the distal portion---portion%1:24:00:: of the respiratory bronchiole---bronchiole%1:08:00:: , the alveolar duct---duct%1:08:00:: , and the alveoli---alveolus%1:08:00:: , continues on and directly supplies the thin pleura---pleura%1:08:00:: ( fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 8 ) .
The bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: , except for a small number---number%1:23:00:: of short branches---branch%1:25:00:: in the hilum---hilum%1:08:00:: , contributes none of the pleural blood---blood%1:08:00:: supply---supply%1:23:00:: .
It does , as in type---type%1:09:00:: 1 , , supply the hilar lymph nodes---lymph_node%1:08:00:: , the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: , the pulmonary vein---pulmonary_vein%1:08:00:: , the bronchi---bronchus%1:08:00:: , and the bronchioles---bronchiole%1:08:00:: - terminating in a common capillary bed---capillary_bed%1:08:00:: with the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: at the level---level%1:07:00:: of the respiratory bronchiole---bronchiole%1:08:00:: .
No bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: anastomoses---anastomosis%1:08:00:: were noted in this group---group%1:03:00:: .
Lung---lung%1:08:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: 3 , ( fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 3 ) is to some degree---degree%1:07:00:: a composite---composite%1:09:00:: of types---type%1:09:00:: 1 , and 2 , .
It is characterized by the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of incompletely developed secondary lobules---lobule%1:08:00:: ; well defined , but haphazardly arranged , interlobular septa---septum%1:08:00:: and a thick , remarkably vascular pleura---pleura%1:08:00:: ( fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 9 ) .
The most distal airways---airway%1:06:01:: are similar to those found in type---type%1:09:00:: 1 , , being composed of numerous , apparently true terminal bronchioles---bronchiole%1:08:00:: and occasional , poorly developed respiratory bronchioles---bronchiole%1:08:00:: ( figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 14 , 15 ) .
In this instance---instance%1:09:00:: , because of incomplete septation---septation%1:04:00:: , the secondary lobule---lobule%1:08:00:: does not constitute in itself what appears to be a small individual lung---lung%1:08:00:: as in type---type%1:09:00:: 1 , .
Air---air%1:27:00:: drifts---drift%1:19:00:: from one area---area%1:08:00:: to another are , therefore , conceivable .
Distally the bronchus---bronchus%1:08:00:: is situated between a pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: on one side---side%1:15:02:: and a pulmonary vein---pulmonary_vein%1:08:00:: on the other , as in type---type%1:09:00:: 1 , ( fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 24 ) .
This relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: , however , is not maintained centrally .
Here the pulmonary vein---pulmonary_vein%1:08:00:: , as in type---type%1:09:00:: 2 , , is noted to draw away from the bronchus---bronchus%1:08:00:: , and to follow a more direct , independent course---course%1:15:00:: to the hilum---hilum%1:08:00:: ( figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 23 , 24 ) .
The bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: in its course---course%1:15:00:: and distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: differs somewhat from that found in other mammals---mammal%1:05:00:: .
As seen in types---type%1:09:00:: 1 , and 2 , , it supplies the hilar lymph nodes---lymph_node%1:08:00:: , vasa vasorum---vasa_vasorum%1:08:00:: to the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: and vein---pulmonary_vein%1:08:00:: , the bronchi---bronchus%1:08:00:: and the terminal bronchioles---bronchiole%1:08:00:: .
As in type---type%1:09:00:: 1 , , it provides arterial blood---blood%1:08:00:: to the interlobular septa---septum%1:08:00:: , and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply---supply%1:23:00:: is seen ( figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 9 , 10 ) .
This pleural supply---supply%1:23:00:: is derived both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: branches---branch%1:25:00:: .
Such a dual derivation---derivation%1:15:00:: was strikingly demonstrated during the injection---injection%1:04:00:: process---process%1:04:00:: where initial filling---filling%1:22:00:: would be noted to occur in several isolated pleural vessels---vessel%1:08:00:: at once .
Some of these were obviously filling from interlobular branches---branch%1:25:00:: of the bronchial arteries---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: while others were filling from direct hilar branches---branch%1:25:00:: following along the pleural surface---surface%1:06:00:: .
With completion---completion%1:04:00:: of filling---filling%1:22:00:: , net-like anastomoses---anastomosis%1:08:00:: were noted to be present between these separately derived branches---branch%1:25:00:: .
An unusual increase---increase%1:11:00:: in the number---number%1:07:00:: of bronchial arteries---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: present within the substance of the lung---lung%1:08:00:: was noted .
This was accounted for primarily by the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of a bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: closely following the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: .
The diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: of this bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: was much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum---vasa_vasorum%1:08:00:: ( figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 16 , 23 , 24 ) .
In distal regions---region%1:15:00:: its diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: would be one-fourth---one-fourth%1:23:00:: to one-fifth---one-fifth%1:23:00:: that of the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: .
This vessel---vessel%1:08:00:: could be followed to the parenchyma---parenchyma%1:08:01:: where it directly provided bronchial arterial blood---blood%1:08:00:: to the alveolar capillary bed---capillary_bed%1:08:00:: ( figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 17 , 18 ) .
Also three---three%1:23:00:: other direct pathways---pathway%1:06:00:: of alveolar bronchial arterial supply---supply%1:23:00:: were noted : via the pleura---pleura%1:08:00:: ; through the interlobular septa---septum%1:08:00:: ; and along the terminal bronchiole---bronchiole%1:08:00:: ( figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 ) .
One bronchial arteriolar pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis---anastomosis%1:08:00:: was noted at the terminal bronchiolar level---level%1:07:00:: ( fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 26 ) .
It is evident that many marked and striking differences---difference%1:11:00:: exist between lungs---lung%1:08:00:: when an inter-species comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: is made .
The significance---significance%1:09:01:: of these differences---difference%1:07:00:: has not been studied nor has the existence---existence%1:26:00:: of corresponding physiologic differences---difference%1:07:00:: been determined .
However , the dynamics---dynamics%1:09:00:: of airflow---airflow%1:11:00:: , from morphologic considerations---consideration%1:09:01:: alone , may conceivably be different in the monkey---monkey%1:05:00:: than in the horse---horse%1:05:00:: .
The volume---volume%1:07:03:: and , perhaps , even the characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: of bronchial arterial blood---blood%1:08:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: might be different in the dog---dog%1:05:00:: than in the horse---horse%1:05:00:: .
Also , interlobular air---air%1:27:00:: drifts---drift%1:19:00:: may be all but nonexistent in the cow---cow%1:05:01:: ; probably occur in the horse---horse%1:05:00:: much as in the human being---human_being%1:05:00:: ; and , in contrast---contrast%1:04:00:: are present to a relatively immense degree---degree%1:07:00:: on a segmental basis---basis%1:09:00:: in the dog---dog%1:05:00:: where lobules---lobule%1:08:00:: are absent ( Van Allen---person%1:03:00:: and Lindskog---person%1:03:00:: , ' 31 ) .
A reason---reason%1:10:01:: for such wide variation---variation%1:11:01:: in the pulmonary morphology---morphology%1:09:00:: is entirely lacking at present .
Within certain wide limits---limit%1:07:00:: anatomy---anatomy%1:09:00:: dictates function---function%1:07:00:: and , if one is permitted to speculate , potential pathology---pathology%1:09:00:: should be included in this statement---statement%1:10:00:: as well .
For example , the marked susceptibility---susceptibility%1:26:00:: of the monkey---monkey%1:05:00:: to respiratory infection---infection%1:26:00:: might be related to its delicate , long alveolar ducts---duct%1:08:00:: and short , large bronchioles---bronchiole%1:08:00:: situated within a parenchyma---parenchyma%1:08:01:: entirely lacking in protective supportive tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: barriers---barrier%1:17:00:: such as those found in types---type%1:09:00:: 1 , and 3 , .
One might also wonder if monkeys---monkey%1:05:00:: are capable of developing bronchiolitis---bronchiolitis%1:26:00:: as we know it in man---man%1:05:01:: or the horse---horse%1:05:00:: .
In addition , it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalized emphysema---emphysema%1:26:00:: occurring in a cow---cow%1:05:01:: , considering its marked lobular development---development%1:22:01:: but , conversely , not difficult to imagine this occurring in the horse---horse%1:05:00:: or the dog---dog%1:05:00:: .
Anatomically , the horse---horse%1:05:00:: lung---lung%1:08:00:: appears to be remarkably like that of man---man%1:05:01:: , insofar as this can be ascertained from comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: of our findings---finding%1:04:00:: in the horse---horse%1:05:00:: with those of others ( Birnbaum---person%1:03:00:: , ' 54 ) in the human being---human_being%1:05:00:: .
The only area---area%1:09:00:: in which one might find major disagreement---disagreement%1:07:00:: in this matter---matter%1:09:00:: is in regard to the alveolar distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: of the bronchial arteries---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: .
As early as 1858 , Le Fort---person%1:03:00:: claimed an alveolar distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: of the bronchial arteries---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: in human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: .
In 1951 , this was reaffirmed by Cudkowicz---person%1:03:00:: .
The opposition---opposition%1:04:00:: to this point of view---point_of_view%1:09:00:: has its staunchest support---support%1:04:02:: in the work---work%1:06:00:: of Miller---person%1:03:00:: ( ' 50 ) .
Apparently , however , Miller---person%1:03:00:: has relied heavily on the anatomy---anatomy%1:09:00:: in dogs---dog%1:05:00:: and cats---cat%1:05:00:: , and he has been criticized for using pathologic human material---material%1:27:00:: in his normal study---study%1:10:00:: ( Loosli---person%1:03:00:: , ' 38 ) .
Although Miller---person%1:03:00:: noted in 1907 that a difference---difference%1:11:00:: in the pleural blood---blood%1:08:00:: supply---supply%1:23:00:: existed between animals---animal%1:03:00:: , nowhere in his published works---work%1:06:00:: is it found that he did a comparative study---study%1:04:00:: of the intrapulmonary features---feature%1:09:00:: of various mammalian lungs---lung%1:08:00:: other than in the dog---dog%1:05:00:: and cat---cat%1:05:00:: ( Miller---person%1:03:00:: , ' 13 ; ' 25 ) .
The meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: of this variation---variation%1:11:01:: in distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: of the bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: as found in the horse---horse%1:05:00:: is not clear .
However , this artery---artery%1:08:00:: is known to be a nutrient vessel---vessel%1:08:00:: with a distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: primarily to the proximal airways---airway%1:06:01:: and supportive tissues---tissue%1:08:00:: of the lung---lung%1:08:00:: .
The alveoli---alveolus%1:08:00:: and respiratory bronchioles---bronchiole%1:08:00:: are primarily diffusing tissues---tissue%1:08:00:: .
Theoretically , they are capable of extracting their required oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: either from the surrounding air---air%1:27:00:: ( Ghoreyeb---person%1:03:00:: and Karsner---person%1:03:00:: , ' 13 ) or from pulmonary arterial blood---blood%1:08:00:: ( Comroe---person%1:03:00:: , ' 58 ) .
Therefore , an explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: of this alveolar bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: supply---supply%1:23:00:: might be the nutritive requirement---requirement%1:17:00:: of an increased amount---amount%1:07:00:: of supportive tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: , not primarily diffusing in nature---nature%1:07:02:: , in the region---region%1:15:00:: of the alveolus---alveolus%1:08:00:: .
If this be true , the possibility---possibility%1:09:00:: exists that an occlusive lesion---lesion%1:26:01:: of the bronchial arteries---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: might cause widespread degeneration---degeneration%1:22:00:: of supportive tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: similar to that seen in generalized emphysema---emphysema%1:26:00:: .
One would not expect such an event---event%1:03:00:: to occur in animals---animal%1:03:00:: possessing lungs---lung%1:08:00:: of types---type%1:09:00:: 1 , or 2 , .
The presence---presence%1:26:00:: of normally occurring bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: anastomoses---anastomosis%1:08:00:: was first noted in 1721 by Ruysch---person%1:03:00:: , and thereafter by many others .
Nakamura---person%1:03:00:: ( ' 58 ) , Verloop---person%1:03:00:: ( ' 48 ) , Marchand---person%1:03:00:: , Gilroy---person%1:03:00:: and Watson---person%1:03:00:: ( ' 50 ) , von Hayek---person%1:03:00:: ( ' 53 ) , and Tobin---person%1:03:00:: ( ' 52 ) have all claimed their normal but relatively nonfunctional existence---existence%1:26:00:: in the human being---human_being%1:05:00:: .
Miller---person%1:03:00:: ( ' 50 ) is the principal antagonist---antagonist%1:18:00:: of this viewpoint---viewpoint%1:09:00:: .
In criticism---criticism%1:10:00:: of the latter 's views---view%1:09:02:: , his conclusions---conclusion%1:09:01:: were based upon dog---dog%1:05:00:: lung---lung%1:08:00:: injection---injection%1:04:00:: studies---study%1:04:00:: in which all of the vascular channels---channel%1:06:00:: were first filled with a solution---solution%1:27:00:: under pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: and then were injected with various sized colored particles---particle%1:27:01:: designed to stop at the arteriolar level---level%1:07:00:: .
As early as 1913 Ghoreyeb---person%1:03:00:: and Karsner---person%1:03:00:: demonstrated with perfusion---perfusion%1:04:00:: studies---study%1:04:00:: in dogs---dog%1:05:00:: that bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: would remain constant at a certain low level---level%1:07:00:: when pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: was maintained in the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: and vein---pulmonary_vein%1:08:00:: , but that increases---increase%1:11:00:: in bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: would occur in response---response%1:19:00:: to a relative drop---drop%1:07:00:: in pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: .
Berry---person%1:03:00:: , Brailsford---person%1:03:00:: and Daly---person%1:03:00:: in 1931 and Nakamura---person%1:03:00:: in 1958 reaffirmed this .
Our own studies---study%1:04:00:: in which bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: anastomoses---anastomosis%1:08:00:: were demonstrated , were accomplished by injecting the bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: first with no pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: on the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: or vein---pulmonary_vein%1:08:00:: , and then by injecting the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: and vein---vein%1:08:00:: afterwards .
It is distinctly possible , therefore , that simultaneous pressures---pressure%1:19:00:: in all three vessels---vessel%1:08:00:: would have rendered the shunts---shunt%1:08:00:: inoperable and hence , uninjectable .
This viewpoint---viewpoint%1:09:00:: is further supported by Verloop---person%1:03:00:: 's ( ' 48 ) demonstration---demonstration%1:10:03:: of thickened bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: and arteriolar muscular coats---coat%1:06:01:: which are capable of acting as valves---valve%1:08:00:: .
In other words , the anastomoses---anastomosis%1:08:00:: between the bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: and pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: should be considered as functional or demand---demand%1:04:00:: shunts---shunt%1:08:00:: .
In addition , little work---work%1:09:00:: has been done on a comparative basis---basis%1:09:00:: in regard to the normal existence---existence%1:26:00:: of bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: anastomoses---anastomosis%1:08:00:: .
Verloop---person%1:03:00:: ( ' 48 ; ' 49 ) found these shunts---shunt%1:08:00:: in the human being---human_being%1:05:00:: but was unable to find them in rats---rat%1:05:00:: .
Ellis---person%1:03:00:: , Grindlay---person%1:03:00:: and Edwards---person%1:03:00:: ( ' 52 ) also were unable to find them in rats---rat%1:05:00:: .
Nakamura---person%1:03:00:: ( ' 58 ) was unable to demonstrate their existence---existence%1:26:00:: , either by anatomic or physiologic methods---method%1:09:00:: , in dogs---dog%1:05:00:: .
The possibility---possibility%1:09:00:: that the absence---absence%1:26:00:: or presence---presence%1:26:00:: of these shunts---shunt%1:08:00:: is species---species%1:14:00:: dependent is therefore inferred .
Certainly , the mere fact---fact%1:26:01:: of failing to demonstrate them in one or another species---species%1:14:00:: does not conclusively deny their existence---existence%1:26:00:: in that species---species%1:14:00:: .
It is , however , highly suggestive and agrees well with our own findings---finding%1:04:00:: in which we also failed to demonstrate normally occurring bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: shunts---shunt%1:08:00:: in certain species---species%1:14:00:: , especially the dog---dog%1:05:00:: .
In conclusion , these findings---finding%1:04:00:: suggest the need---need%1:26:00:: for a comparative physiology---physiology%1:09:00:: , pathology---pathology%1:09:00:: , and histology---histology%1:09:00:: of mammalian lungs---lung%1:08:00:: .
In addition , a detailed interspecies survey---survey%1:04:02:: of the incidence---incidence%1:24:00:: of generalized pulmonary emphysema---pulmonary_emphysema%1:26:00:: in mammals---mammal%1:05:00:: would be interesting and pertinent .
Also , for the present---present%1:28:00:: , great caution---caution%1:07:00:: should be exercised in the choice---choice%1:09:00:: of an experimental animal---animal%1:03:00:: for pulmonary studies---study%1:04:00:: if they are to be applied to man---man%1:05:01:: .
This is especially so if the dog---dog%1:05:00:: , cat---cat%1:05:00:: or monkey---monkey%1:05:00:: are to be used , in view of their marked anatomical differences---difference%1:07:00:: from man---man%1:05:01:: .
Finally , it is suggested that in many respects---respect%1:09:00:: the horse---horse%1:05:00:: lung---lung%1:08:00:: may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human---human%1:05:00:: than any other presently known species---species%1:14:00:: .
The main subgross anatomical features---feature%1:09:00:: of the lungs---lung%1:08:00:: of various mammals---mammal%1:05:00:: are presented .
A tabulation---tabulation%1:10:00:: of these features---feature%1:09:00:: permits the lungs---lung%1:08:00:: to be grouped into three distinctive subgross types---type%1:09:00:: .
Type---type%1:09:00:: 1 , is represented by the cow---cow%1:05:01:: , sheep---sheep%1:05:00:: , and pig---pig%1:05:00:: ; type---type%1:09:00:: 2 , , by the dog---dog%1:05:00:: , cat---cat%1:05:00:: , and monkey---monkey%1:05:00:: ; type---type%1:09:00:: 3 , , by the horse---horse%1:05:00:: .
Lobularity---lobularity%1:07:00:: is extremely well developed in type---type%1:09:00:: 1 , ; absent in type---type%1:09:00:: 2 , ; imperfectly developed in type---type%1:09:00:: 3 , .
The pleura---pleura%1:08:00:: and interlobular septa---septum%1:08:00:: are thick in types---type%1:09:00:: 1 , and 3 , .
The pleura---pleura%1:08:00:: is extremely thin in type---type%1:09:00:: 2 , and septa---septum%1:08:00:: are absent .
Arterial supply---supply%1:23:00:: to the pleura---pleura%1:08:00:: in types---type%1:09:00:: 1 , and 3 , is provided by the bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: , and in type---type%1:09:00:: 2 , , by the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: .
In types---type%1:09:00:: 1 , , 2 , and 3 , the bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: terminates in a capillary bed---capillary_bed%1:08:00:: shared in common with the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: at the level---level%1:07:00:: of the distal bronchiole---bronchiole%1:08:00:: .
In type---type%1:09:00:: 3 , the bronchial artery---bronchial_artery%1:08:00:: also provides blood---blood%1:08:00:: directly to the alveolar capillary bed---capillary_bed%1:08:00:: .
True terminal bronchioles---bronchiole%1:08:00:: comprise the most frequent form---form%1:07:01:: taken by the distal airways---airway%1:06:01:: in types---type%1:09:00:: 1 , and 3 , , although small numbers---number%1:23:00:: of poorly developed respiratory bronchioles---bronchiole%1:08:00:: are present .
Well developed respiratory bronchioles---bronchiole%1:08:00:: , on the other hand , appear to be the only form---form%1:07:01:: taken by the distal airways---airway%1:06:01:: in type---type%1:09:00:: 2 , .
In type---type%1:09:00:: 1 , the pulmonary vein---pulmonary_vein%1:08:00:: closely follows the course---course%1:15:00:: of the bronchus---bronchus%1:08:00:: and the pulmonary artery---pulmonary_artery%1:08:00:: from the periphery---periphery%1:25:00:: to the hilum---hilum%1:08:00:: .
This maybe due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue---connective_tissue%1:08:00:: barriers---barrier%1:17:00:: present .
In type---type%1:09:00:: 3 , this general relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: is maintained peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein---pulmonary_vein%1:08:00:: follows a more independent path---path%1:15:00:: to the hilum---hilum%1:08:00:: as is the case---case%1:09:00:: throughout the lung---lung%1:08:00:: in type---type%1:09:00:: 2 , .
If the content---content%1:09:00:: of faith---faith%1:09:00:: is to be presented today in a form---form%1:09:00:: that can be `` understanded of the people---people%1:14:00:: '' - and this , it must not be forgotten , is one of the goals---goal%1:09:00:: of the perennial theological task---task%1:04:01:: - there is no other choice---choice%1:09:02:: but to abandon completely a mythological manner---manner%1:07:02:: of representation---representation%1:09:00:: .
This does not mean that mythological language---language%1:10:00:: as such can no longer be used in theology---theology%1:04:00:: and preaching---preaching%1:10:00:: .
The absurd notion---notion%1:09:02:: that demythologization---demythologization%1:10:00:: entails the expurgation---expurgation%1:04:00:: of all mythological concepts---concept%1:09:00:: completely misrepresents Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: 's intention---intention%1:09:00:: .
His point---point%1:10:01:: is not that mythology---mythology%1:14:00:: may not be used , but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality---conceptuality%1:09:00:: for expressing the Christian kerygma---kerygma%1:10:00:: .
When we say that a mythological mode---mode%1:07:00:: of thought---thought%1:09:00:: must be completely abandoned , we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means---means%1:04:00:: for presenting the Christian understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
Mythological concepts---concept%1:09:00:: may by all means still be used , but they can be used responsibly only as `` symbols---symbol%1:10:00:: '' or `` ciphers---cipher%1:10:01:: '' , that is , only if they are also constantly interpreted in non mythological ( or existential ) terms---term%1:10:00:: .
The statement---statement%1:10:02:: is often made that when Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: argues in this way---way%1:07:01:: , he `` overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block---stumbling_block%1:06:00:: which myth---myth%1:10:00:: is supposed to put in the way---way%1:04:01:: of accepting the Christian faith---faith%1:09:00:: '' .
But this statement---statement%1:10:02:: is completely unconvincing .
If Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: 's own definition---definition%1:10:00:: of myth---myth%1:10:00:: is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements---pronouncement%1:10:00:: ) , the evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent---extent%1:26:00:: to which the mythological concepts---concept%1:09:00:: of traditional theology---theology%1:09:01:: have become incredible and irrelevant .
Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: in the great urban centers---urban_center%1:15:00:: of our culture---culture%1:14:00:: that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms---form%1:09:00:: in which the gospel---gospel%1:10:00:: has been communicated .
On the contrary , even in the heart---heart%1:15:00:: of `` the Bible belt---bible_belt%1:15:00:: '' itself , as can be attested by any one who is called to work there , the industrial---industrial_revolution%1:28:00:: and technological revolutions---technological_revolution%1:28:00:: have long been under way , together with the corresponding changes---change%1:24:00:: in man---man%1:18:04:: 's picture---picture%1:09:00:: of himself and his world---world%1:09:00:: .
In fact , it is in just such a situation---situation%1:26:00:: that the profundity---profundity%1:07:01:: of Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: 's argument---argument%1:10:02:: is disclosed .
Although the theological forms---form%1:09:00:: of the past---past%1:28:00:: continue to exist in a way---way%1:07:01:: they do not in a more secularized situation---situation%1:26:00:: , the striking thing---thing%1:26:00:: is the rapidity---rapidity%1:07:00:: with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
This is especially in evidence among the present generation---generation%1:14:01:: of the suburban middle class---middle_class%1:14:00:: .
Time and again in counseling---counseling%1:10:00:: and teaching---teaching%1:04:00:: , one encounters members---member%1:18:00:: of this group---group%1:03:00:: whose attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: to bring into some kind---kind%1:09:00:: of unity---unity%1:26:00:: the insubstantial mythologies---mythology%1:14:00:: of their `` fundamentalist '' heritage---heritage%1:09:00:: and the stubborn reality---reality%1:26:01:: of the modern world---modern_world%1:28:00:: are only too painfully obvious .
The same thing---thing%1:26:00:: is also evidenced by the extreme `` culture---culture%1:14:00:: Protestantism---protestantism%1:09:00:: '' so often observed to characterize the preaching---preaching%1:10:00:: and teaching---teaching%1:04:00:: of the American churches---church%1:14:00:: .
In the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of a truly adequate conceptuality---conceptuality%1:09:00:: in which the gospel---gospel%1:10:00:: can be expressed , the unavoidable need---need%1:26:00:: to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources---resource%1:07:00:: are at hand - and this usually means one or another of the various forms---form%1:09:01:: of `` folk---folk%1:14:00:: religion---religion%1:09:00:: '' current in the situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
This is not to say that the only explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: of the present infatuation---infatuation%1:12:00:: with Norman Vincent Peale---person%1:03:00:: 's `` cult---cult%1:09:01:: of reassurance---reassurance%1:04:00:: '' or the other types---type%1:09:00:: of a purely cultural Christianity---christianity%1:09:00:: is the ever-present need---need%1:26:00:: for a demythologized gospel---gospel%1:10:00:: .
But it is to say that this need---need%1:26:00:: is far more important for such infatuation---infatuation%1:12:00:: than most of the pundits---pundit%1:18:00:: seem to have suspected .
However , even if the latent demand---demand%1:10:00:: for demythologization---demythologization%1:10:00:: is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming , at least among the cultured elements---element%1:09:00:: of the population---population%1:14:00:: there tends to be an almost complete indifference---indifference%1:12:00:: to the church---church%1:14:00:: and its traditional message---message%1:10:00:: of sin---sin%1:07:00:: and grace---grace%1:26:00:: .
To be sure , when this is pointed out , a common response---response%1:19:00:: among certain churchmen---churchman%1:18:00:: is to fulminate about `` the little flock---flock%1:14:02:: '' and `` the great crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: '' and to take solace---solace%1:12:00:: from Paul---person%1:03:00:: 's castigation---castigation%1:10:00:: of the `` wisdom---wisdom%1:07:01:: of the wise '' in the opening chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: of First Corinthians .
But can we any longer afford the luxury---luxury%1:07:00:: of such smug indignation---indignation%1:12:00:: ?
Can the church---church%1:14:00:: risk assuming that the `` folly---folly%1:07:00:: '' of men---man%1:18:04:: is as dear to God---god%1:18:00:: as their `` wisdom---wisdom%1:07:00:: '' , or , as is also commonly implied , that `` the foolishness---foolishness%1:07:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: '' and `` the foolishness---foolishness%1:07:00:: of men---man%1:18:04:: '' are simply two ways---way%1:07:01:: of talking about the same thing---thing%1:07:00:: ?
Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts---gift%1:09:00:: we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation---cooperation%1:04:01:: our mission---mission%1:04:00:: in the world---world%1:09:01:: must become increasingly precarious ?
There is an ancient and venerable tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: in the church---church%1:14:00:: ( which derives , however , from the heritage---heritage%1:09:00:: of the Greeks---greek%1:18:00:: rather than from the Bible---bible%1:10:00:: ) that God---god%1:18:00:: is completely independent of his creation---creation%1:06:00:: and so has no need---need%1:26:00:: of men---man%1:18:04:: for accomplishing his work---work%1:04:00:: in the world---world%1:17:01:: .
by analogy---analogy%1:09:00:: , the church---church%1:14:00:: also has been regarded as entirely independent of the `` world---world%1:17:01:: '' in the sense---sense%1:10:00:: of requiring nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: from it in order to be the church---church%1:14:00:: .
But , as Scripture---scripture%1:10:00:: everywhere reminds us , God---god%1:18:00:: does have need---need%1:26:00:: of his creatures---creature%1:03:00:: , and the church---church%1:14:00:: , a fortiori , can ill afford to do without the talents---talent%1:18:00:: with which the world---world%1:17:01:: , by God---god%1:18:00:: 's providence---providence%1:04:00:: , presents it .
And yet this is exactly the risk---risk%1:26:00:: we run when we assume , as we too often do , that we can continue to preach the gospel---gospel%1:10:00:: in a form---form%1:09:00:: that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men---man%1:18:04:: .
Until we translate this gospel---gospel%1:10:00:: into a language---language%1:10:00:: that enlightened men---man%1:18:04:: today can understand , we are depriving ourselves of the very resources---resource%1:07:00:: on which the continued success---success%1:11:00:: of our witness---witness%1:10:00:: most certainly depends .
In arguing in this way---way%1:07:01:: , we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement---restatement%1:10:00:: of the kerygma---kerygma%1:10:00:: can be achieved ; and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons---reason%1:16:00:: to justify such a conviction---conviction%1:09:00:: .
But the main point---point%1:10:01:: here is that even if such a restatement---restatement%1:10:00:: were not possible , the demand---demand%1:10:00:: to demythologize the kerygma---kerygma%1:10:00:: would still be unavoidable .
This is what we mean when we say this demand---demand%1:10:00:: must be accepted without condition---condition%1:10:01:: .
If to be a Christian---christian%1:18:00:: means to say yes where I otherwise say no , or where I do not have the right---right%1:07:00:: to say anything at all , then my only choice---choice%1:09:02:: is to refuse to be a Christian---christian%1:18:00:: .
Expressed differently : if the price---price%1:07:01:: for becoming a faithful follower---follower%1:18:00:: of Jesus Christ---jesus_christ%1:18:00:: is some form---form%1:09:01:: of self-destruction---self-destruction%1:04:00:: , whether of the body---body%1:08:00:: or of the mind---mind%1:09:00:: - sacrificium corporis , sacrificium intellectus - then there is no alternative---alternative%1:09:00:: but that the price---price%1:07:01:: remain unpaid .
This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument---argument%1:10:02:: of this concluding chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: .
Modern man , as Dietrich Bonhoeffer---person%1:03:00:: has told us , has `` come of age '' ; and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain---gain%1:07:02:: and is , in fact , marked by the estrangement---estrangement%1:26:00:: from the depths---depth%1:07:01:: that seems to be the cost---cost%1:07:01:: of human maturation---maturation%1:22:01:: , it is still a positive step---step%1:04:02:: forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it .
In any event , it is an irreversible step---step%1:04:02:: , and if we are at all honest with ourselves , we will know we have no other alternative---alternative%1:09:00:: than to live in the world---world%1:17:01:: in which God---god%1:18:00:: has seen fit to place us .
To say this , of course , is to take up a position---position%1:09:00:: on one side---side%1:14:00:: of a controversy---controversy%1:10:00:: going on now for some two hundred years---year%1:28:01:: , or , at any rate , since the beginning---beginning%1:28:00:: of the distinctively modern period---period%1:28:00:: in theological thought---thought%1:09:02:: .
We have aligned ourselves with that `` liberal '' tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: in Protestant Christianity---christianity%1:09:00:: that counts among the great names---name%1:18:00:: in its history---history%1:28:00:: those of Schleiermacher---person%1:03:00:: , Ritschl---person%1:03:00:: , Herrmann---person%1:03:00:: , Harnack---person%1:03:00:: , and Troeltsch---person%1:03:00:: , and more recently , Schweitzer---person%1:03:00:: and the early Barth---person%1:03:00:: and , in part at least , Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: .
It is to this same tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: that most of the creative figures---figure%1:18:00:: in the last century---century%1:28:00:: and a half---half%1:23:00:: of American theology---theology%1:09:01:: also belong .
For we must number here not only the names---name%1:10:00:: of Bushnell---person%1:03:00:: , Clarke---person%1:03:00:: , and Rauschenbusch---person%1:03:00:: , not to mention those of `` the Chicago School---group%1:03:00:: '' and Macintosh---person%1:03:00:: , but those of the brothers---brother%1:18:00:: Niebuhr---person%1:03:00:: and ( if America---america%1:15:00:: may claim him ! )
Tillich---person%1:03:00:: as well .
Finally , we may also mention the several members---member%1:18:00:: of the self-consciously `` neoliberal '' movement---movement%1:14:00:: that developed at the University of Chicago---group%1:03:00:: and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work---work%1:06:00:: of Alfred North Whitehead---person%1:03:00:: .
What makes this long and diverse tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men---man%1:18:04:: in a distinctively modern world---modern_world%1:28:00:: .
Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: of the apostolic church---church%1:14:00:: , they have exhibited no willingness---willingness%1:07:00:: whatever to sacrifice their modernity---modernity%1:07:00:: to their Christianity---christianity%1:09:00:: .
They have insisted , rather , on living fully and completely within modern culture---culture%1:09:01:: and , so far from considering this treason---treason%1:04:00:: to God---god%1:18:00:: , have looked upon it as the only way---way%1:04:01:: they could be faithful to him .
When we say , then , that today , in our situation---situation%1:26:00:: , the demand---demand%1:10:00:: for demythologization---demythologization%1:10:00:: must be accepted without condition---condition%1:10:01:: , we are simply saying that at least this much---much%1:23:00:: of the liberal tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: is an enduring achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: .
However much---much%1:23:00:: we may have to criticize liberal theology---theology%1:09:01:: 's constructive formulations---formulation%1:10:00:: , the theology---theology%1:09:01:: we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism---liberalism%1:09:00:: , not behind it .
In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step---step%1:04:02:: in breaking the deadlock---deadlock%1:26:00:: into which Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: 's attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to formulate such a theology---theology%1:09:01:: has led .
For we have said , in effect , that of the two alternatives---alternative%1:09:00:: to his position---position%1:09:00:: variously represented by the other participants---participant%1:18:00:: in the demythologizing discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: , only one---one%1:23:00:: is really an alternative---alternative%1:09:00:: .
If the demand---demand%1:10:00:: for demythologization---demythologization%1:10:00:: is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology---theology%1:09:01:: unconditionally , the position---position%1:09:00:: of the `` right---right%1:14:00:: '' is clearly untenable .
Whereas Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: 's `` center---center%1:14:00:: '' position---position%1:09:00:: is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds---ground%1:16:00:: alone , the general position---position%1:09:00:: of the `` right---right%1:14:00:: '' , as represented , say , by Karl Barth---person%1:03:00:: , involves the rejection---rejection%1:04:00:: or at least qualification---qualification%1:04:00:: of the demand---demand%1:10:00:: for demythologization---demythologization%1:10:00:: and so is invalidated on the material grounds---ground%1:16:00:: we have just considered .
It follows , then , provided the possibilities---possibility%1:09:00:: have been exhausted , that the only real alternative---alternative%1:09:00:: is the general viewpoint---viewpoint%1:09:00:: of the `` left---left%1:14:00:: '' , which has been represented on the Continent---continent%1:15:00:: by Fritz Buri---person%1:03:00:: and , to some extent---extent%1:26:00:: at least , is found in much---much%1:23:00:: that is significant in American and English theology---theology%1:09:01:: .
In order to make the implications---implication%1:09:00:: of our position---position%1:09:00:: as clear as possible , we may develop this argument---argument%1:10:02:: at greater length---length%1:07:02:: .
We may show , first , that there cannot possibly be an alternative---alternative%1:09:00:: other than the three---three%1:23:00:: typically represented by Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: , Barth---person%1:03:00:: , and Buri---person%1:03:00:: .
To do this , it is sufficient to point out that if the principle---principle%1:09:02:: in terms of which alternatives---alternative%1:09:00:: are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two---two%1:23:00:: , then the question---question%1:10:01:: of a `` third '' possibility---possibility%1:09:00:: is a meaningless question---question%1:10:01:: .
Thus , if what is at issue is whether `` All S is P '' , it is indifferent whether `` Some S is not P '' or `` No S is P '' , since in either case---case%1:26:00:: the judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: in question is false .
Hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology---theology%1:09:01:: myth---myth%1:10:00:: is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit---bit%1:23:01:: of myth---myth%1:10:00:: or a considerable quantity---quantity%1:03:00:: is accepted ; for , in either event---event%1:26:00:: , the first possibility---possibility%1:09:00:: is excluded .
Hence , if what is in question is whether in a given theology---theology%1:09:00:: myth is or is not completely rejected , it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for , in either event , the first possibility is excluded .
Therefore , the only conceivable alternatives---alternative%1:09:00:: are those represented , on the one hand , by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions---position%1:09:00:: of Buri---person%1:03:00:: and Barth---person%1:03:00:: and , on the other hand , by the third but really pseudo position---position%1:09:00:: ( analogous to a round square---square%1:25:00:: ) of Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: .
A second point---point%1:10:01:: requires more extended comment---comment%1:10:00:: .
It will be recalled from the discussion---discussion%1:10:02:: in Section---section%1:10:00:: 7 that the position---position%1:09:00:: of the `` right---right%1:14:00:: '' , as represented by Barth---person%1:03:00:: , rests on the following thesis---thesis%1:10:00:: : The only tenable alternative---alternative%1:09:00:: to Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: 's position---position%1:09:00:: is a theology---theology%1:09:01:: that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand---demand%1:10:00:: for demythologization---demythologization%1:10:00:: and existential interpretation---interpretation%1:09:01:: ; ( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics---hermeneutics%1:09:00:: or method of interpretation---interpretation%1:09:01:: ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: to the event---event%1:03:00:: Jesus Christ---jesus_christ%1:18:00:: by means---means%1:04:00:: of statements---statement%1:10:00:: that , from Bultmann---person%1:03:00:: 's point of view---point_of_view%1:09:00:: , are mythological .
It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the `` right '' , as represented by Barth , rests on the following thesis : The only tenable alternative to Bultmann 's position is a theology---theology%1:09:00:: that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; and ( 3 ) in so doing , frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that , from Bultmann 's point of view , are mythological .
Interestingly enough , the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of the digitalis glycosides---digitalis_glycoside%1:27:00:: is inhibited by a high concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: of potassium---potassium%1:27:00:: in the incubation---incubation%1:04:00:: medium---medium%1:27:00:: and is enhanced by the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of potassium---potassium%1:27:00:: ( Wolff---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ) .
The precise mechanism---mechanism%1:22:00:: for organification---organification%1:22:00:: of iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: in the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: is not as yet completely understood .
However , the formation---formation%1:04:00:: of organically bound iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: , mainly mono-iodotyrosine---mono-iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: , can be accomplished in cell-free systems---system%1:27:00:: .
In the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of additions---addition%1:06:00:: to the homogenate---homogenate%1:27:00:: , the product---product%1:06:00:: formed is an iodinated particulate protein---protein%1:27:00:: ( Fawcett---person%1:03:00:: and Kirkwood---person%1:03:00:: , 1953 ; Taurog---person%1:03:00:: , Potter---person%1:03:00:: and Chaikoff---person%1:03:00:: , 1955 ; Taurog---person%1:03:00:: , Potter---person%1:03:00:: , Tong---person%1:03:00:: , and Chaikoff---person%1:03:00:: , 1956 ; Serif---person%1:03:00:: and Kirkwood---person%1:03:00:: , 1958 ; De Groot---person%1:03:00:: and Carvalho---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ) .
This iodoprotein---iodoprotein%1:27:00:: does not appear to be the same as what is normally present in the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: , and there is no evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: so far that thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free systems---system%1:27:00:: .
In addition , the iodoamino acid---iodoamino_acid%1:27:00:: formed in largest quantity---quantity%1:03:00:: in the intact thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: is di-iodotyrosine---di-iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: .
If tyrosine---tyrosine%1:27:00:: and a system---system%1:27:00:: generating hydrogen peroxide---hydrogen_peroxide%1:27:00:: are added to a cell-free homogenate---homogenate%1:27:00:: of the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: , large quantities---quantity%1:03:00:: of free mono-iodotyrosine---mono-iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: can be formed ( Alexander---person%1:03:00:: , 1959 ) .
It is not clear whether this system---system%1:27:00:: bears any resemblance---resemblance%1:07:00:: to the in vivo iodinating mechanism---mechanism%1:22:00:: , and a system---system%1:27:00:: generating peroxide---peroxide%1:27:00:: has not been identified in thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: .
On chemical grounds---grounds%1:09:00:: it seems most likely that iodide---iodide%1:27:00:: is first converted to * * f and then to * * f as the active iodinating species---species%1:09:00:: .
In the thyroid gland---thyroid_gland%1:08:00:: it appears that proteins---protein%1:27:00:: ( chiefly thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: ) are iodinated and that free tyrosine---tyrosine%1:27:00:: and thyronine---thyronine%1:27:00:: are not iodinated .
Iodination---iodination%1:22:00:: of tyrosine---tyrosine%1:27:00:: , however , is not enough for the synthesis---synthesis%1:22:00:: of hormone---hormone%1:08:00:: .
The mono---mono-iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: - and di-iodotyrosine---di-iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: must be coupled to form tri-iodothyronine---tri-iodothyronine%1:27:00:: and thyroxine---thyroxine%1:08:00:: .
The mechanism---mechanism%1:22:00:: of this coupling---coupling%1:06:01:: has been studied in some detail---detail%1:09:00:: with non-enzymatic systems---system%1:27:00:: in vitro and can be simulated by certain di-iodotyrosine---di-iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: analogues---analogue%1:07:00:: ( Pitt-Rivers---person%1:03:00:: and James---person%1:03:00:: , 1958 ) .
There is so far no evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: to indicate conclusively that this coupling---coupling%1:06:01:: is under enzymatic control---control%1:24:00:: .
The chemical nature---nature%1:07:02:: of the iodocompounds---iodocompound%1:27:00:: is discussed below ( pp. 76 et seq. ) .
Little---little%1:23:00:: is known of the synthetic mechanisms---mechanism%1:22:00:: for formation---formation%1:04:00:: of thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: .
Its synthesis---synthesis%1:22:00:: has not been demonstrated in cell-free systems---system%1:27:00:: , nor has its synthesis---synthesis%1:22:00:: by systems---system%1:27:00:: with intact thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: cells---cell%1:03:00:: in vitro been unequivocally proven .
There is some reason---reason%1:16:00:: to think that thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: synthesis---synthesis%1:22:00:: may proceed independently of iodination---iodination%1:22:00:: , for in certain transplantable tumours---tumour%1:26:00:: of the rat---rat%1:05:00:: thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: containing essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: , a protein---protein%1:27:00:: that appears to be thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: has been observed in ultracentrifuge---ultracentrifuge%1:06:00:: experiments---experiment%1:09:00:: ( Wolff---person%1:03:00:: , Robbins---person%1:03:00:: and Rall---person%1:03:00:: , 1959 ) .
Similar findings---finding%1:04:00:: have been noted in a patient---patient%1:18:00:: with congenital absence---absence%1:26:00:: of the organification---organification%1:22:00:: enzymes---enzyme%1:27:00:: , whose thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: could only concentrate iodide---iodide%1:27:00:: .
In addition , depending on availability---availability%1:07:00:: of dietary iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: , thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: may contain varying quantities---quantity%1:03:00:: of iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: .
Since the circulating thyroid hormones---thyroid_hormone%1:08:00:: are the amino acids---amino_acid%1:27:00:: thyroxine---thyroxine%1:08:00:: and tri-iodothyronine---tri-iodothyronine%1:27:00:: ( cf. Section---section%1:10:00:: C ) , it is clear that some mechanism---mechanism%1:17:00:: must exist in the thyroid gland---thyroid_gland%1:08:00:: for their release---release%1:22:00:: from proteins---protein%1:27:00:: before secretion---secretion%1:22:00:: .
The presence---presence%1:26:00:: of several proteases---protease%1:27:00:: and peptidases---peptidase%1:27:00:: has been demonstrated in the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: .
One of the proteases---protease%1:27:00:: has pH---ph%1:07:00:: optimum of about 3.7 and another of about 5.7 ( McQuillan---person%1:03:00:: , Stanley---person%1:03:00:: and Trikojus---person%1:03:00:: , 1954 ; Alpers---person%1:03:00:: , Robbins---person%1:03:00:: and Rall---person%1:03:00:: , 1955 ) .
The finding---finding%1:04:00:: that the concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: of one of these proteases---protease%1:27:00:: is increased in thyroid glands---thyroid_gland%1:08:00:: from TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: treated animals---animal%1:03:00:: suggests that this protease---protease%1:27:00:: may be active in vivo .
There is no conclusive evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: yet that either of the proteases---protease%1:27:00:: has been prepared in highly purified form---form%1:09:01:: nor is their specificity---specificity%1:07:01:: known .
A study---study%1:04:00:: of their activity---activity%1:22:00:: on thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: has shown that thyroxine---thyroxine%1:08:00:: is not preferentially released and that the degradation---degradation%1:04:00:: proceeds stepwise with the formation---formation%1:04:00:: of macromolecular intermediates---intermediate%1:27:00:: ( Alpers---person%1:03:00:: , Petermann---person%1:03:00:: and Rall---person%1:03:00:: , 1956 ) .
Besides proteolytic enzymes---enzyme%1:27:00:: the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: possesses de-iodinating enzymes---enzyme%1:27:00:: .
A microsomal de-iodinase---de-iodinase%1:27:00:: with a pH---ph%1:07:00:: optimum of around 8 , and requiring reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide---triphosphopyridine_nucleotide%1:27:00:: for activity---activity%1:22:00:: , has been identified in the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: ( Stanbury---person%1:03:00:: , 1957 ) .
This de-iodinating enzyme---enzyme%1:27:00:: is effective against mono---mono-iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: - and di-iodotyrosine---di-iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: , but does not de-iodinate thyroxine---thyroxine%1:08:00:: or tri-iodothyronine---tri-iodothyronine%1:27:00:: .
It is assumed that the iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: released from the iodotyrosines---iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: remains in the iodide---iodide%1:27:00:: pool---pool%1:21:00:: of the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: , where it is oxidised and re-incorporated into thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: .
The thyroxine---thyroxine%1:08:00:: and tri-iodothyronine---tri-iodothyronine%1:27:00:: released by proteolysis---proteolysis%1:22:00:: and so escaping de-iodination---de-iodination%1:22:00:: presumably diffuse into the blood stream---bloodstream%1:08:00:: .
It has been shown that thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: binds thyroxine---thyroxine%1:08:00:: , but the binding---binding%1:07:00:: does not appear to be particularly strong .
It has been suggested that the plasma---plasma%1:08:00:: thyroxine---thyroxine%1:08:00:: binding---binding%1:07:00:: proteins---protein%1:27:00:: , which have an extremely high affinity---affinity%1:19:02:: for thyroxine---thyroxine%1:08:00:: , compete with thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: for thyroxine---thyroxine%1:08:00:: ( Ingbar---person%1:03:00:: and Freinkel---person%1:03:00:: , 1957 ) .
Antithyroid drugs---drug%1:06:00:: are of two general types---type%1:09:00:: .
One type---type%1:09:00:: has a small univalent anion---anion%1:17:00:: of the thiocyanate---thiocyanate%1:27:00:: perchlorate---perchlorate%1:27:00:: fluoroboride---fluoroboride%1:27:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: .
This ion---ion%1:17:00:: inhibits thyroid hormone---thyroid_hormone%1:08:00:: synthesis---synthesis%1:22:00:: by interfering with iodide---iodide%1:27:00:: concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: in the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: .
It does not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism---mechanism%1:22:00:: as such .
The other group---group%1:03:00:: of antithyroid agents---agent%1:27:00:: or drugs---drug%1:06:00:: is typified by thiouracil---thiouracil%1:27:00:: .
These drugs---drug%1:06:00:: have no effect---effect%1:19:00:: on the iodide---iodide%1:27:00:: concentrating mechanism---mechanism%1:17:00:: , but they inhibit organification---organification%1:22:00:: .
The mechanism---mechanism%1:22:00:: of action---action%1:26:00:: of these drugs---drug%1:06:00:: has not been completely worked out , but certain of them appear to act by reducing the oxidised form---form%1:09:01:: of iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: before it can iodinate thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: ( Astwood---person%1:03:00:: , 1954 ) .
On the other hand , there are a few antithyroid drugs---drug%1:06:00:: of this same general type---type%1:09:00:: , such as resorcinol---resorcinol%1:27:00:: , possessing no reducing---reducing%1:22:00:: activity---activity%1:22:00:: and possibly acting through formation---formation%1:04:00:: of a complex---complex%1:27:00:: with molecular iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: .
Any of the antithyroid drugs---drug%1:06:00:: , of either type---type%1:09:00:: , if given in large enough doses---dose%1:06:00:: for a long period of time---period_of_time%1:28:00:: will cause goitre---goitre%1:26:00:: , owing to inhibition---inhibition%1:04:00:: of thyroid hormone---thyroid_hormone%1:08:00:: synthesis---synthesis%1:22:00:: , with production---production%1:04:00:: of hypothyroidism---hypothyroidism%1:26:00:: .
The anterior lobe---lobe%1:08:00:: of the pituitary---pituitary%1:08:00:: then responds by an increased output---output%1:06:00:: of TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: , causing the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: to enlarge .
The effect---effect%1:19:00:: of drugs---drug%1:06:00:: that act on the iodide---iodide%1:27:00:: concentrating mechanism---mechanism%1:22:00:: can be counteracted by addition---addition%1:04:02:: of relatively large amounts---amount%1:07:00:: of iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: to the diet---diet%1:13:00:: .
The antithyroid drugs---drug%1:06:00:: of the thiouracil---thiouracil%1:27:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: , however , are not antagonised by such means---means%1:06:00:: .
Besides those of the thiouracil---thiouracil%1:27:00:: and resorcinol---resorcinol%1:27:00:: types---type%1:09:00:: , certain antithyroid drugs---drug%1:06:00:: have been found in naturally occurring foods---food%1:03:00:: .
The most conclusively identified is L - 5 - vinyl---vinyl%1:27:00:: - 2 - thio oxazolidone , which was isolated from rutabaga---rutabaga%1:13:00:: ( Greer---person%1:03:00:: , 1950 ) .
It is presumed to occur in other members---member%1:24:00:: of the Brassica---brassica%1:20:00:: family---family%1:14:03:: .
There is some evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that naturally occurring goitrogens---goitrogen%1:27:00:: may play a role---role%1:04:00:: in the development---development%1:22:01:: of goitre---goitre%1:26:00:: , particularly in Tasmania---location%1:03:00:: and Australia---location%1:03:00:: ( Clements---person%1:03:00:: and Wishart---person%1:03:00:: , 1956 ) .
There it seems that the goitrogen---goitrogen%1:27:00:: ingested by dairy---dairy%1:06:00:: animals---animal%1:03:00:: is itself inactive but is converted in the animal---animal%1:03:00:: to an active goitrogen---goitrogen%1:27:00:: , which is then secreted in the milk---milk%1:13:01:: .
Besides the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of goitrogens---goitrogen%1:27:00:: in the diet---diet%1:13:00:: , the level---level%1:07:00:: of iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: itself in the diet---diet%1:13:00:: plays a major role---role%1:04:00:: in governing the activity---activity%1:22:00:: of the thyroid gland---thyroid_gland%1:08:00:: .
In the experimental animal---animal%1:03:00:: and in man---man%1:05:01:: gross deficiency---deficiency%1:26:00:: in dietary iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: causes thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: hyperplasia---hyperplasia%1:26:00:: , hypertrophy---hypertrophy%1:26:00:: and increased thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: activity---activity%1:22:00:: ( Money---person%1:03:00:: , Rall---person%1:03:00:: and Rawson---person%1:03:00:: , 1952 ; Stanbury---person%1:03:00:: , Brownell---person%1:03:00:: , Riggs---person%1:03:00:: , Perinetti---person%1:03:00:: , Itoiz---person%1:03:00:: , and Del Castillo---person%1:03:00:: , 1954 ) .
In man---man%1:05:01:: the normal level---level%1:07:00:: of iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: in the diet---diet%1:13:00:: and the level---level%1:07:00:: necessary to prevent development---development%1:22:01:: of goitre---goitre%1:26:00:: is about 100 | mg---mg%1:23:00:: per day---day%1:28:00:: .
With lower levels---level%1:07:00:: , thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: hypertrophy---hypertrophy%1:26:00:: and increased thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: blood---blood%1:08:00:: flow---flow%1:04:00:: enable the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: to accumulate a larger proportion---proportion%1:24:00:: of the daily intake---intake%1:04:00:: of iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: .
Further , the gland---gland%1:08:00:: is able to re-use a larger fraction---fraction%1:06:00:: of the thyroid hormone---thyroid_hormone%1:08:00:: de-iodinated peripherally .
In the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of a low iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: intake---intake%1:04:00:: , thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: labelled in vivo with * * f is found to contain more mono-iodotyrosine---mono-iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: than normal , the amounts---amount%1:07:00:: of di-iodotyrosine---di-iodotyrosine%1:27:00:: and iodothyronines---iodothyronine%1:27:00:: being correspondingly reduced .
This appears to result from both a reduced amount---amount%1:03:00:: of the iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: substrate---substrate%1:27:00:: and a more rapid secretion---secretion%1:22:00:: of newly iodinated thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: .
If the deficiency---deficiency%1:26:00:: persists long enough , it is reasonable to suppose that the * * f label---label%1:27:00:: will reflect the * * f distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: in the thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: .
Similar results---result%1:19:00:: might be expected from the influence---influence%1:04:00:: of drugs---drug%1:06:00:: or pathological conditions---condition%1:26:00:: that limit iodide---iodide%1:27:00:: trapping , or organification---organification%1:22:00:: , or accelerate thyroglobulin---thyroglobulin%1:27:00:: proteolysis---proteolysis%1:22:00:: .
The name---name%1:10:00:: thyroid-stimulating hormone---thyroid-stimulating_hormone%1:27:00:: ( TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: ) has been given to a substance---substance%1:03:00:: found in the anterior pituitary gland---pituitary_gland%1:08:00:: of all species---species%1:14:00:: of animal---animal%1:03:00:: so far tested for its presence---presence%1:26:00:: .
The hormone---hormone%1:08:00:: has also been called thyrotrophin---thyrotrophin%1:27:00:: or thyrotrophic hormone---thyrotrophic_hormone%1:27:00:: .
At the present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism---biochemical_mechanism%1:22:00:: TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: acts on the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: , but for bio-assay---bioassay%1:09:00:: of the hormone---hormone%1:08:00:: there are a number---number%1:07:00:: of properties---property%1:07:00:: by which its activity---activity%1:22:00:: may be estimated , including release---release%1:22:00:: of iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: from the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: , increase---increase%1:22:00:: in thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: weight---weight%1:07:00:: , increase---increase%1:22:00:: in mean height---height%1:26:00:: of the follicular cells---cell%1:03:00:: and increase---increase%1:22:00:: in the thyroidal uptake---uptake%1:04:00:: of * * f .
Here we shall restrict discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: to those methods---method%1:09:00:: that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determining the concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: of TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: in blood---blood%1:08:00:: .
Brown---person%1:03:00:: ( 1959 ) has reviewed generally the various methods---method%1:09:00:: of assaying TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: , and the reader---reader%1:18:00:: is referred to her paper---paper%1:10:01:: for further information---information%1:09:00:: on the subject---subject%1:09:01:: .
As long ago as 1851 it was pointed out by Niepce---person%1:03:00:: ( 1851 ) that there is a connection---connection%1:26:00:: between the pituitary---pituitary%1:08:00:: and the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: .
This connection---connection%1:26:00:: was clarified by Smith---person%1:03:00:: and Smith---person%1:03:00:: ( 1922 ) , who showed that saline extracts---extract%1:27:00:: of fresh bovine pituitary glands---pituitary_gland%1:08:00:: could re-activate the atrophied thyroids---thyroid%1:08:00:: of hypophysectomised tadpoles---tadpole%1:05:00:: .
The first attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: to isolate TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: came a decade---decade%1:28:00:: later , when Janssen---person%1:03:00:: and Loeser---person%1:03:00:: ( 1931 ) used trichloroacetic acid---trichloroacetic_acid%1:27:00:: to separate the soluble TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: from insoluble impurities---impurity%1:26:00:: .
After their work---work%1:06:00:: other investigators---investigator%1:18:01:: applied salt---salt%1:27:00:: fractionation---fractionation%1:22:00:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: to the problem---problem%1:10:00:: , as well as fractionation---fractionation%1:22:00:: with organic solvents---solvent%1:27:00:: , such as acetone---acetone%1:27:00:: .
Albert---person%1:03:00:: ( 1949 ) has concluded that the most active preparations---preparation%1:27:00:: of TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: made during this period---period%1:28:00:: , from 1931 to 1945 , were probably about 100 to 300 times as potent as the starting---starting%1:04:00:: material---material%1:27:00:: .
Much of this work---work%1:09:00:: has been reviewed by White---person%1:03:00:: ( 1944 ) and by Albert---person%1:03:00:: ( 1949 ) .
Developments---development%1:11:01:: up to about 1957 have been discussed by Sonenberg---person%1:03:00:: ( 1958 ) .
In the last few years---year%1:28:01:: , the application---application%1:04:02:: of chromatographic and other modern techniques---technique%1:09:00:: to the problem---problem%1:26:00:: of isolating TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: has led to further purification---purification%1:04:00:: ( Bates---person%1:03:00:: and Condliffe---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ; Pierce---person%1:03:00:: , Carsten---person%1:03:00:: and Wynston---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ) .
The most active preparations---preparation%1:27:00:: obtained by these two groups---group%1:03:00:: of investigators---investigator%1:18:01:: appear to be similar in potency---potency%1:07:00:: , composition---composition%1:07:01:: and physical properties---physical_property%1:07:00:: .
Two problems---problem%1:10:00:: present themselves in considering any hormone---hormone%1:08:00:: in blood---blood%1:08:00:: .
First , is the circulating form---form%1:09:01:: of the hormone---hormone%1:08:00:: the same as that found in the gland---gland%1:08:00:: where it is synthesised and stored ?
Second , what is its concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: in normal circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: and in what circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: will this concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: depart from the normal level---level%1:07:00:: and in which direction---direction%1:24:00:: ?
It is therefore necessary to consider the properties---property%1:07:00:: of pituitary---pituitary%1:08:00:: TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: if the fragmentary chemical information---information%1:09:00:: about blood---blood%1:08:00:: TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: is to be discussed rationally .
The importance---importance%1:07:00:: of knowing in what chemical---chemical%1:27:00:: forms---form%1:09:00:: the hormone---hormone%1:08:00:: may exist is accentuated by the recent observation---observation%1:04:00:: that there exists an abnormally long-acting TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: in blood---blood%1:08:00:: drawn from many thyrotoxic patients---patient%1:18:00:: ( Adams---person%1:03:00:: , 1958 ) .
Whether this abnormal TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: differs chemically from pituitary---pituitary%1:08:00:: TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: , or is , alternatively , normal TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: with its period---period%1:28:00:: of effectiveness---effectiveness%1:07:01:: modified by some other blood---blood%1:08:00:: constituent---constituent%1:06:00:: , cannot be decided without chemical study---study%1:04:00:: of the activity---activity%1:22:00:: in the blood---blood%1:08:00:: of these patients---patient%1:18:00:: and a comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: of the substance---substance%1:03:00:: responsible for the blood---blood%1:08:00:: activity---activity%1:22:00:: with pituitary---pituitary%1:08:00:: TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: .
In evaluating data---data%1:14:00:: on the concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: of TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: in blood---blood%1:08:00:: , one must examine critically the bio-assay---bioassay%1:09:00:: methods---method%1:09:00:: used to obtain them .
The introduction---introduction%1:10:00:: of the United States Pharmacopoeia---group%1:03:00:: reference---reference%1:10:04:: standard---standard%1:10:00:: in 1952 and the redefinition---redefinition%1:10:00:: and equating of the USP---group%1:03:00:: and international units---unit%1:23:00:: of thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: stimulating activity---activity%1:22:00:: have made it possible to compare results---result%1:19:00:: published by different investigators---investigator%1:18:01:: since that time---time%1:11:00:: .
We should like to re-emphasise the importance---importance%1:07:00:: of stating results---result%1:19:00:: solely in terms of international units---unit%1:23:00:: of TSH---tsh%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:22:00:: and of avoiding the re-introduction---re-introduction%1:10:00:: of biological units---unit%1:23:00:: .
For the most part , this discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: will be confined to results---result%1:19:00:: obtained since the introduction---introduction%1:04:01:: of the reference---reference%1:10:04:: standard---standard%1:10:00:: .
The international unit---unit%1:23:00:: ( u . ) , adopted to make possible the comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: of results---result%1:19:00:: from different laboratories---laboratory%1:06:00:: ( Mussett---person%1:03:00:: and Perry---person%1:03:00:: , 1955 ) , has been defined as the amount---amount%1:03:00:: of activity---activity%1:22:00:: present in 13.5 mg---mg%1:23:00:: of the International Standard Preparation .
The international unit---unit%1:23:00:: is equipotent with the USP---group%1:03:00:: unit---unit%1:23:00:: adopted in 1952 , which was defined as the amount---amount%1:03:00:: of activity---activity%1:22:00:: present in 20 mg---mg%1:23:00:: of the USP---group%1:03:00:: reference---reference%1:10:04:: substance---substance%1:03:00:: .
`` Right '' , said the fingerprint man---fingerprint_man%1:18:00:: .
`` Also , if you 're going to believe those prints---fingerprint%1:10:01:: , you 'll have to look for a killer---killer%1:18:00:: who 's a top-grade piano player---piano_player%1:18:00:: '' .
He demonstrated by playing an imaginary piano---piano%1:06:00:: , doing a staccato passage---passage%1:10:01:: with a broadly exaggerated attack---attack%1:04:01:: .
To make it clearer he shifted to acting out , but with no change---change%1:24:00:: of manner---manner%1:07:01:: , the killing---killing%1:04:00:: of Rose Mallory---person%1:03:00:: .
His hands---hand%1:08:00:: snatched at an imaginary bucket---bucket%1:06:00:: , swooping down hard to grab it and coming away with equal snap---snap%1:04:00:: like a ball---ball%1:06:02:: that 's been bounced hard .
In the same way---way%1:07:01:: he pantomimed grasping a mantel---mantel%1:06:00:: and bouncing cleanly off that , pressing his hands---hand%1:08:00:: against the floor---floor%1:06:00:: and bouncing cleanly off that .
He was moving like a ballet dancer---ballet_dancer%1:18:00:: , playing for laughs---laugh%1:10:00:: .
If Rose Mallory---person%1:03:00:: 's killer---killer%1:18:00:: acted this way---way%1:07:01:: , catching up with him was going to be a cinch---cinch%1:04:01:: .
We 'd know him by his stretch pants---stretch_pants%1:06:00:: and the flowers---flower%1:20:00:: he 'd wear twined in his hair---hair%1:08:00:: .
Perhaps if Felix---person%1:03:00:: had first come upon us when this boy---boy%1:18:00:: was not cavorting so gaily up and down the hall---hall%1:06:03:: outside---outside%1:15:01:: the murdered woman---woman%1:18:00:: 's apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: , we might have had less trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: convincing Felix---person%1:03:00:: of our seriousness---seriousness%1:12:00:: .
This , you will remember , was still New Year's Day---new_year's_day%1:28:00:: .
By the time---time%1:11:00:: Felix---person%1:03:00:: turned up it was early afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: , which , one would think , would be late enough so that by then , except for small children---child%1:18:00:: and a few hardy souls---soul%1:03:00:: who had not yet sobered up , it could have been expected that people---people%1:14:00:: would no longer be having any sort---sort%1:09:00:: of active interest---interest%1:09:00:: in the previous night---night%1:28:00:: 's noisemakers---noisemaker%1:06:00:: and paper---paper%1:27:00:: hats---hat%1:06:00:: .
Felix---person%1:03:00:: was the exception---exception%1:09:01:: .
He had retained his hat---hat%1:06:00:: and his horn---horn%1:06:06:: , and , whatever fun---fun%1:04:00:: might still be going , he was ready to join it .
That , incidentally , might give you some idea---idea%1:09:00:: of what Felix---person%1:03:00:: was like .
After all , he had n't happened upon us in that second floor---floor%1:06:01:: hall---hall%1:06:03:: without warning---warning%1:10:01:: .
The ME 's boys---boy%1:18:02:: had finished their on-the-spot examination---examination%1:04:00:: and the body---body%1:08:00:: had been removed for autopsy---autopsy%1:04:00:: .
The meat---meat%1:13:01:: wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: , therefore , was not out in front of the house---house%1:06:00:: any more , but the cluster---cluster%1:14:00:: of squad cars---squad_car%1:06:00:: was still there and there was a cop---cop%1:18:00:: on the door---door%1:06:01:: downstairs to screen any comings---coming%1:04:02:: and goings---going%1:04:01:: .
There was , furthermore , the crowd---crowd%1:14:01:: of curious onlookers---onlooker%1:18:00:: gathered in the street---street%1:06:00:: and a couple---couple%1:23:01:: more cops---cop%1:18:00:: to hold them at a decent distance---distance%1:07:00:: .
Just put yourself in Felix---person%1:03:00:: 's place---place%1:26:01:: for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: .
You 're a taxpayer---taxpayer%1:18:00:: , householder---householder%1:18:00:: , landlord---landlord%1:18:00:: .
You 've been away from home---home%1:15:04:: for the New Year---new_year's_eve%1:28:00:: festivities---festivity%1:04:00:: , but now the party---party%1:14:00:: is over and you come home .
Defining sobriety---sobriety%1:26:00:: in the limited sense---sense%1:10:00:: of being free from the clinical symptoms---symptom%1:10:00:: of the effects---effect%1:19:00:: of alcohol---alcohol%1:13:00:: ingested and not yet eliminated from the system---system%1:08:00:: , you are sober .
You still have your paper---paper%1:27:00:: hat---hat%1:06:00:: and you 're wearing it , but then , it is an extraordinary paper---paper%1:27:00:: hat---hat%1:06:00:: and , in addition to anything else you may be , you are also the sculptor---sculptor%1:18:00:: who created that most peculiar dame---dame%1:18:00:: out in the back yard---backyard%1:06:00:: .
It 's not too much to assume that you will have a more lasting interest---interest%1:09:00:: in paper---paper%1:27:00:: hats---hat%1:06:00:: than will Mr. Average Citizen---person%1:03:00:: .
You have your paper---paper%1:27:00:: horn---horn%1:06:06:: clutched in your big , craggy fist---fist%1:08:00:: , and for your entrance---entrance%1:11:00:: you have planned a noisy , colorful and exuberant greeting---greeting%1:10:00:: to your friends---friend%1:18:00:: and tenants---tenant%1:18:00:: .
You find your house---house%1:06:00:: a focus---focus%1:09:00:: of public and police---police%1:14:00:: attention---attention%1:09:00:: .
Can you imagine yourself forgetting under the circumstances that you are approaching this startling and unexpected situation---situation%1:26:00:: so unsuitably hatted and armed with a paper---paper%1:27:00:: horn---horn%1:06:06:: ?
Maybe one could be startled into forgetfulness---forgetfulness%1:09:00:: .
You shoulder your way---way%1:23:00:: through the cluster---cluster%1:14:00:: of the curious and you barge up to the cop---cop%1:18:00:: on the door---door%1:06:01:: .
Instead of answering you , he sticks his head---head%1:08:00:: in the door---door%1:06:01:: and shouts up the stairs .
`` Got the upstairs guy---guy%1:18:00:: '' , he bellows .
`` The owner---owner%1:18:00:: .
Even then , as you go into the house---house%1:06:00:: oppressed by the knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: that something is cooking and that your house---house%1:06:00:: has passed under this unaccountable , official control---control%1:26:00:: , could you go on forgetting that you still had that ridiculous hat---hat%1:06:00:: on your head---head%1:08:00:: and you were still carrying that childish horn---horn%1:06:06:: in your hand---hand%1:08:00:: ?
What I'm getting at is that we were fully prepared for Felix---person%1:03:00:: 's being an odd one .
We 'd seen his handiwork---handiwork%1:06:00:: out in the back yard---backyard%1:06:00:: , and the little---little%1:23:00:: his tenants---tenant%1:18:00:: had told us of him did make him sound a little special .
We were not , however , prepared for anything like the apparition---apparition%1:18:00:: that confronted us as Felix---person%1:03:00:: came up the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: .
He , of course , must have been equally unprepared for what confronted him , but , nonetheless , I did find his reaction---reaction%1:04:00:: startling .
If Felix---person%1:03:00:: was still wearing the hat---hat%1:06:00:: and carrying the horn---horn%1:06:06:: because he 'd forgotten about them , he now remembered .
He came bounding up the stairs and joined the dance---dance%1:14:00:: .
He adjusted the hat---hat%1:06:00:: , lifted the horn---horn%1:06:06:: to his lips---lip%1:08:00:: as though it were a flute---flute%1:06:00:: , and fell in alongside our fingerprint expert---fingerprint_expert%1:18:00:: to cavort with him .
Our man---man%1:18:00:: stopped dead and glowered at Felix---person%1:03:00:: .
Felix---person%1:03:00:: threw his head---head%1:08:00:: back and laughed a laugh---laugh%1:10:00:: that shook the timbers---timber%1:06:00:: of even that solidly built old house---house%1:06:00:: .
This was a bull---bull%1:18:02:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: .
His face---face%1:08:00:: was ruddy and heavy and unlined , and when he laughed he showed his teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: , which were big and white and strong and unquestionably home-grown .
I do n't remember ever seeing teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: that were quite so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not dentures---denture%1:06:00:: .
His hair---hair%1:08:00:: had receded most of the way---way%1:15:00:: to the back---back%1:06:00:: of his neck---neck%1:08:00:: .
He had only a fringe---fringe%1:25:00:: of hair---hair%1:08:00:: and he wore it cropped short .
It was almost as white as his teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: .
For a man---man%1:18:00:: of his mass---mass%1:07:00:: he was curiously short .
He was n't a dwarf---dwarf%1:18:00:: but he was a bit of a comic figure---figure%1:07:00:: .
A man---man%1:18:00:: with so big and so staggeringly developed a torso---torso%1:08:00:: and such long and powerful arms---arm%1:08:00:: is expected to stand taller than five feet---foot%1:23:00:: five .
For Felix---person%1:03:00:: it was a bit of a stretch---stretch%1:04:01:: to make even that measurement .
The man---man%1:18:00:: was just this side---side%1:15:02:: of being a freak---freak%1:18:00:: .
We waited till he had finished laughing , and that gave us a few moments---moment%1:28:01:: for taking stock of him .
He was dressed in a manner---manner%1:07:02:: Esquire might suggest for the outdoor man---outdoor_man%1:18:00:: 's country---country%1:15:01:: weekend---weekend%1:28:00:: .
Dark gray sports jacket---sports_jacket%1:06:00:: , lighter gray slacks---slacks%1:06:00:: , pink flannel---flannel%1:06:00:: shirt---shirt%1:06:00:: , black silk---silk%1:06:00:: necktie---necktie%1:06:00:: .
His eyes---eye%1:08:00:: were clear .
He was freshly shaved , and if there had been any alcohol---alcohol%1:13:00:: in him we could never have missed detecting some scent---scent%1:07:00:: of it on the massive gusts---gust%1:19:00:: of his laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: .
Not even a whiff---whiff%1:19:00:: .
`` Felix---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Gibby---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` That much Latin---latin%1:10:00:: we remember '' , Gibby---person%1:03:00:: said dryly .
`` You always live up to your name---name%1:26:00:: , always like this , always making happy '' ?
`` I try '' , Felix---person%1:03:00:: said blithely .
`` The world is full of blokes---bloke%1:18:00:: who put their hearts---heart%1:09:00:: into making the tragic scene---scene%1:26:00:: .
I 've never noticed that it improves things---thing%1:26:00:: any '' .
`` Bully for you '' , Gibby---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` What 's the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of your name---name%1:10:00:: '' ?
`` No rest---rest%1:24:00:: of it .
Felix---person%1:03:00:: is all there is '' .
`` The past---past%1:28:00:: I leave to historians---historian%1:18:00:: '' , Felix---person%1:03:00:: intoned , demonstrating that he could be pompous as well as happy .
`` You live in the present---present%1:28:00:: '' ?
`` In the present---present%1:28:00:: '' , Felix---person%1:03:00:: proclaimed .
`` For the future---future%1:28:00:: .
Is there any other time---time%1:28:00:: in which a man---man%1:18:04:: can live '' ?
`` We '' , Gibby---person%1:03:00:: announced , `` are not philosophers---philosopher%1:18:00:: .
We are Assistant District Attorneys---person%1:03:00:: .
This gentleman---gentleman%1:18:00:: is a police officer---police_officer%1:18:00:: .
He is a fingerprint specialist---fingerprint_specialist%1:18:00:: .
Could your future---future%1:28:00:: , your immediate future---future%1:28:00:: , be made to include taking us upstairs , giving us a bit of space---space%1:15:00:: in which our friend---friend%1:18:00:: can work , and making available to him your finger tips---fingertip%1:08:00:: '' ?
This was more than joy---joy%1:12:00:: .
It was ecstasy---ecstasy%1:26:02:: .
`` Those lovely whorls---whorl%1:25:00:: '' , he chortled .
I love fingerprints---fingerprint%1:10:01:: '' .
He was prancing along the hall---hall%1:06:03:: , heading for the next flight of stairs---flight_of_stairs%1:06:00:: .
Gibby---person%1:03:00:: called him back .
`` We 're here because of what happened last night---night%1:28:00:: '' , he said .
`` Past---past%1:28:00:: , yes---yes%1:10:00:: , but important .
Since it is important , for the record---record%1:10:03:: let 's have the full name---name%1:10:00:: '' .
Felix---person%1:03:00:: asked .
`` Grubb---person%1:03:00:: '' , Felix---person%1:03:00:: whispered .
`` Felix Grubb---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Gibby---person%1:03:00:: asked , not bothering to whisper .
`` Shh '' , Felix---person%1:03:00:: implored .
Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world '' .
Obligingly Gibby---person%1:03:00:: lowered his voice---voice%1:10:00:: .
`` Felix Grubb---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` No---no%1:10:00:: .
Edmund---person%1:03:00:: , but not for years---year%1:28:01:: .
For years---year%1:28:01:: it 's been just Felix---person%1:03:00:: .
First thing---thing%1:04:00:: I did after my twenty-first birthday---birthday%1:28:00:: was go into court---court%1:06:02:: and have it officially changed , and this is something I do n't tell everybody .
That was almost forty years---year%1:28:01:: ago '' .
Having volunteered that he was a man---man%1:18:00:: of about sixty , he bounded up the stairs and with each leap---leap%1:04:00:: rendered the number---number%1:23:00:: less credible .
This was a broth of a boy---broth_of_a_boy%1:18:00:: , our Felix---person%1:03:00:: , and nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: was more obvious than the joy---joy%1:12:00:: he took in demonstrating how agile he was and how full of juice---juice%1:13:00:: and spirit---spirit%1:07:02:: .
The cops---cop%1:18:00:: would gather up Connor---person%1:03:00:: and the foursome---foursome%1:14:00:: on the third floor---floor%1:06:01:: and bring us those of them who would voluntarily submit to fingerprinting---fingerprinting%1:04:00:: .
You may think we did n't need Nancy---person%1:03:00:: and Jean---person%1:03:00:: , but you always get what you can when you can , and we had no guarantee---guarantee%1:10:00:: that a fingerprint---fingerprint%1:10:01:: record---record%1:10:03:: on them could n't be useful before we were through with this case---case%1:04:00:: .
Also , if we had excluded the ladies---lady%1:18:02:: we would have to that extent---extent%1:26:00:: let the whole world---world%1:14:02:: know at least that much---much%1:23:00:: of where we stood .
The killer---killer%1:18:00:: , if in our present group---group%1:03:00:: , would certainly be interested in knowing that much---much%1:23:00:: , and even though with the fingerprint---fingerprint%1:10:01:: evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: what it was I could see no way---way%1:04:01:: he could use this bit---bit%1:17:00:: of information---information%1:09:00:: to improve on his situation---situation%1:26:00:: , there might always be some way---way%1:04:01:: .
If you can possibly avoid it , you do n't hand out any extra chances---chance%1:26:00:: .
Felix---person%1:03:00:: took us into his studio---studio%1:06:00:: .
It was that oddly shaped space---space%1:03:00:: at the very top---top%1:15:01:: of the house---house%1:06:00:: , where ceiling---ceiling%1:06:00:: heights---height%1:07:00:: had to accommodate themselves to the varying angles---angle%1:25:00:: of roof---roof%1:06:00:: slope---slope%1:07:00:: .
At each angle---angle%1:25:00:: of its pitch---pitch%1:07:01:: a big skylight---skylight%1:06:00:: had been fitted into the roof---roof%1:06:00:: and all these skylights---skylight%1:06:00:: were fitted with systems---system%1:06:00:: of multiple screens---screen%1:06:04:: and shades---shade%1:06:00:: .
When Felix---person%1:03:00:: first opened the door---door%1:06:00:: on it , all these shades---shade%1:06:00:: were tightly drawn and the whole studio---studio%1:06:00:: was as dark as night---night%1:28:00:: .
He quickly fixed that , rolling back the shades---shade%1:06:00:: on some of the skylights---skylight%1:06:00:: and adjusting screens---screen%1:06:04:: on the others .
He flew about the place---place%1:15:06:: making these adjustments---adjustment%1:04:01:: and it was obvious that what he was doing was the fruit---fruit%1:06:00:: of long experience---experience%1:09:01:: .
None of his movements---movement%1:04:00:: was tentative .
There was no process---process%1:04:00:: of trial and error---trial_and_error%1:04:00:: .
Starting with the room---room%1:06:00:: completely blacked out , as it was when we came in , he unerringly fixed things---thing%1:06:00:: so that the whole place---place%1:15:06:: was bathed in the maximum---maximum%1:23:00:: of light---light%1:07:01:: without at any point---point%1:28:00:: admitting even so much as a crack---crack%1:17:00:: of glare---glare%1:07:00:: .
There was no display---display%1:04:00:: of either works in progress---work_in_progress%1:06:00:: or of finished work---work%1:06:00:: .
Here and there on work table---work_table%1:06:00:: or pedestal---pedestal%1:06:00:: stood a shape---shape%1:03:00:: with a sheet---sheet%1:06:00:: or a tarpaulin---tarpaulin%1:06:00:: draped over it .
These shapes---shape%1:03:00:: might have been mad , but there was no telling .
The equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: was solid and heavy and in good condition---condition%1:26:00:: .
Everything was orderly and it seemed to be arranged for the workman---workman%1:18:00:: 's comfort---comfort%1:26:00:: , convenience---convenience%1:26:00:: and efficiency---efficiency%1:09:00:: .
There were tools---tool%1:06:00:: about but they were neatly kept .
There was no confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: and no litter---litter%1:27:00:: .
Supplies of sheet metal---sheet_metal%1:06:00:: were neatly stacked in bins---bin%1:06:00:: .
The red glow---glow%1:07:00:: from the cove---cove%1:17:00:: had died out of the sky---sky%1:17:00:: .
The two in the bed---bed%1:06:00:: knew each other as old people---people%1:14:00:: know the partners---partner%1:18:01:: with whom they have shared the same bed---bed%1:06:00:: for many years---years%1:28:00:: , and they needed to say no more .
The things---thing%1:10:00:: left unsaid they both felt deeply , and with a sigh---sigh%1:10:00:: they fell back on the well stuffed pillows---pillow%1:06:00:: .
Anita---person%1:03:00:: put out the remaining candles---candle%1:06:00:: with a long snuffer---snuffer%1:06:01:: , and in the smell---smell%1:09:02:: of scented candlewick---candlewick%1:06:00:: , the comforting awareness---awareness%1:09:00:: of each other 's bodies---body%1:08:00:: , the retained pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: of dancers---dancer%1:18:00:: and guests---guest%1:18:00:: remembered , their minds---mind%1:09:01:: grew numb and then empty of images---image%1:09:00:: .
They slept - Mynheer---person%1:03:00:: with a marvelously high-pitched snoring---snoring%1:04:00:: , the damn seahorse---seahorse%1:05:01:: ivory---ivory%1:27:00:: teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: watching him from a bedside---bedside%1:15:00:: table---table%1:06:01:: .
In the ballroom---ballroom%1:06:00:: below , the dark---dark%1:26:00:: had given way to moonlight---moonlight%1:19:00:: coming in through the bank---bank%1:14:01:: of French windows---french_window%1:06:00:: .
It was a delayed moon---moon%1:17:01:: , but now the sky---sky%1:17:00:: had cleared of scudding black---black%1:07:00:: and the stars---star%1:17:00:: sugared the silver-gray---silver_gray%1:07:00:: sky---sky%1:17:00:: .
Martha Schuyler---person%1:03:00:: , old , slow , careful of foot---foot%1:04:00:: , came down the great staircase---staircase%1:06:00:: , dressed in her best lace-drawn black silk---silk%1:06:00:: , her jeweled shoe---shoe%1:06:00:: buckles---buckle%1:06:00:: held forward .
`` Well , I'm here at last '' , she said , addressing the old portraits on the walls---wall%1:06:00:: .
`` I do n't hear the music---music%1:09:00:: .
She came to the ballroom---ballroom%1:06:00:: and stood on the two carpeted steps---steps%1:06:00:: that led down to it .
Peter---person%1:03:00:: , you lummox---lummox%1:18:00:: , you 've forgot to order the musicians---musician%1:18:01:: '' .
She stood there , a large old woman---old_woman%1:18:00:: , smiling at the things---thing%1:09:00:: she would say to him in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: , this big foolish baby---baby%1:18:00:: of a son---son%1:18:00:: .
There were times---time%1:11:00:: now , like this , when she lost control of the time---time%1:28:04:: count---count%1:23:00:: and moved freely back and forth into three generations---generation%1:28:00:: .
Was it a birthday---birthday%1:28:00:: ball---ball%1:14:00:: ?
When Peter---person%1:03:00:: had reached his majority---majority%1:28:00:: at eighteen ?
Or was it her own first ball---ball%1:14:00:: as mistress---mistress%1:18:01:: of this big house---house%1:06:00:: , a Van Rensselaer---location%1:03:00:: bride---bride%1:18:00:: from way upstate near Albany---albany%1:15:00:: , from Rensselaerwyck---location%1:03:00:: .
And this handsome booby---booby%1:18:00:: , staring and sweating , was he her bridegroom---bridegroom%1:18:00:: ?
Martha---person%1:03:00:: picked up the hem---hem%1:06:00:: of her gown---gown%1:06:00:: and with eyes---eye%1:08:00:: closed she slowly began to dance a stately minuet---minuet%1:04:00:: around the ballroom---ballroom%1:06:00:: .
David Cortlandt---person%1:03:00:: was tired beyond almost the limits---limit%1:28:00:: of his flesh---flesh%1:08:01:: .
He had ridden hard from Boston---boston%1:15:00:: , and he was not used to horseback---horseback%1:05:00:: .
Now , driving the horse---horse%1:05:00:: and sulky---sulky%1:06:00:: borrowed from Mynheer Schuyler---person%1:03:00:: , he felt as if every bone---bone%1:08:00:: was topped by burning oil---oil%1:27:00:: and that every muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: was ready to dissolve into jelly---jelly%1:13:01:: and leave his big body---body%1:08:00:: helpless and unable to move .
The road---road%1:06:00:: leading south along the river---river%1:17:00:: was shaded with old trees---tree%1:20:00:: , and in the moonlight---moonlight%1:19:00:: the silvery landscape---landscape%1:15:00:: was like a setting---setting%1:15:00:: for trolls---troll%1:18:00:: and wood---wood%1:14:00:: gods---god%1:18:01:: rather than the Hudson River---hudson_river%1:17:00:: Valley---valley%1:17:00:: of his boyhood---boyhood%1:28:00:: memories---memory%1:09:02:: .
He slapped the reins---rein%1:06:00:: on the back---back%1:08:00:: of the powerful gray horse---horse%1:05:00:: and held on as the sulky---sulky%1:06:00:: 's wheels---wheel%1:06:00:: hit a pothole---pothole%1:17:00:: and came out with a jolt---jolt%1:11:00:: and went on .
He would cross to Manhattan---manhattan%1:15:00:: , to Harlem Heights---location%1:03:00:: , before morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
There a certain farmhouse---farmhouse%1:06:00:: was a station---station%1:06:00:: for the Sons of Liberty---group%1:03:00:: .
He would send on by trusted messenger---messenger%1:18:00:: the dispatches---dispatch%1:10:00:: with their electrifying news---news%1:10:00:: .
And he would sleep , sleep , and never think of roads---road%1:06:00:: and horses---horse%1:05:00:: ' sore haunches---haunch%1:05:00:: , of colonial wars---war%1:04:00:: .
Strange how everything here fitted back into his life---life%1:26:02:: , even if he had been away so long .
Mynheer---person%1:03:00:: , Sir Francis---person%1:03:00:: , the valley---valley%1:17:00:: society---society%1:14:01:: , the very smell---smell%1:09:02:: of the river---river%1:17:00:: on his right---right%1:15:00:: purling along to the bay---bay%1:17:00:: past fish---fish%1:05:00:: weirs---weir%1:06:00:: and rocks---rock%1:17:01:: , and ahead the sleepy ribbon---ribbon%1:17:00:: of moon---moon%1:17:01:: drenched road---road%1:06:00:: .
A mist---mist%1:19:00:: was walking on the water---water%1:17:00:: , white as cotton---cotton%1:06:00:: , but with a blending---blending%1:04:01:: and merging---merging%1:04:02:: grace---grace%1:07:01:: .
Ahead there was a stirring---stirring%1:04:00:: of sudden movement---movement%1:04:00:: at a crossroads---crossroad%1:06:00:: .
David---person%1:03:00:: reached for the pair---pair%1:23:00:: of pistols---pistol%1:06:00:: in the saddlebags---saddlebag%1:06:00:: at his feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
A strange wood---wood%1:14:00:: creature---creature%1:03:00:: came floating up from a patch---patch%1:15:00:: of berry---berry%1:13:00:: bushes---bush%1:14:00:: .
It was a grotesque hen---hen%1:05:02:: , five or six feet---foot%1:23:00:: tall .
It had the features---feature%1:08:00:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: bewhiskered by clumps---clump%1:14:00:: of loose feathers---feather%1:05:00:: .
It ran , this apocalyptic beast---beast%1:03:00:: , on two thin legs---leg%1:08:02:: , and its wings---wing%1:05:00:: - were they feathered arms---arm%1:08:00:: ?
Its groin---groin%1:08:00:: was bloody .
Black strips---strip%1:17:00:: of skin---skin%1:05:01:: hung from it .
The horse---horse%1:05:00:: shied at the dreadful thing---thing%1:06:01:: and flared its nostrils .
David---person%1:03:00:: took a firm hand with it .
The creature---creature%1:03:00:: in feathers---feather%1:05:00:: looked around and David---person%1:03:00:: saw the mad eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , glazed with an insane fear---fear%1:12:00:: .
The ungainly bird---bird%1:05:00:: thing---thing%1:06:01:: ran away , and to David---person%1:03:00:: its croaking---croaking%1:10:00:: sounded like the crowing---crow%1:05:00:: of a tormented rooster---rooster%1:05:00:: .
The Sons---group%1:03:00:: were out tonight .
New York---new_york%1:15:01:: lay bleaching in the summer---summer%1:28:00:: sun---sun%1:17:00:: , and the morning fish hawk---fish_hawk%1:05:00:: , flying in the heated air---air%1:15:00:: , saw below him the long triangular wedge---wedge%1:25:00:: of Manhattan Island---location%1:03:00:: .
It was thickly settled by fifteen thousand citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: and laid out into pig---pig%1:05:00:: infested streets---street%1:06:00:: , mostly around the Battery---location%1:03:00:: , going bravely north to Wall Street---wall_street%1:15:00:: , but giving up and becoming fields---field%1:15:00:: and farms---farm%1:06:00:: in the region---region%1:15:00:: of Harlem Heights---location%1:03:00:: .
From there it looked across at Westchester County---location%1:03:00:: and the Hudson River---hudson_river%1:17:00:: where the manor houses---manor_house%1:06:00:: , estates---estate%1:21:01:: , and big farms---farm%1:06:00:: of the original ( non Indian ) landowners---landowner%1:18:00:: began .
On the east side---east_side%1:15:00:: of the island---island%1:17:00:: of Manhattan---manhattan%1:15:00:: the indifferent hawk---hawk%1:05:00:: knew the East River---location%1:03:00:: that connected New York Bay---new_york_bay%1:17:00:: with Long Island Sound---long_island_sound%1:17:00:: .
On the western tip---tip%1:15:00:: of Long Island---long_island%1:15:00:: protruded Brooklyn Heights---location%1:03:00:: .
It commanded a view---view%1:09:01:: over Manhattan---manhattan%1:15:00:: and the harbor---harbor%1:15:00:: .
A fringe---fringe%1:25:00:: of housing---housing%1:06:00:: and gardens---garden%1:14:00:: bearded the top---top%1:15:02:: of the heights---heights%1:15:00:: , and behind it were sandy roads---road%1:06:00:: leading past farms---farm%1:06:00:: and hayfields---hayfield%1:15:00:: .
Husbandry---husbandry%1:04:00:: was bounded by snake-rail fences---snake-rail_fence%1:06:00:: , and there were grazing cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: .
On the shores---shore%1:17:00:: north and south , the fishers---fisher%1:18:00:: and mooncursers - smugglers---smuggler%1:18:00:: - lived along the churning Great South Bay---location%1:03:00:: and the narrow barrier---barrier%1:06:00:: of sand---sand%1:27:00:: , Fire Island---location%1:03:00:: .
The morning hawk---hawk%1:05:00:: , hungry for any eatable , killable , digestible item---item%1:06:00:: , kept his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: on the ring---ring%1:25:00:: of anchored ships---ship%1:06:00:: that lay off the shores---shore%1:17:00:: in the bay---bay%1:17:00:: , sheltered by the Jersey---new_jersey%1:15:00:: inlets---inlet%1:17:00:: .
They often threw tidbits---tidbit%1:13:00:: overboard .
The larger ships---ship%1:06:00:: were near Paulus Hook---location%1:03:00:: , already being called , by a few , Jersey City---location%1:03:00:: .
These were the ships---ship%1:06:00:: of His Majesty---person%1:03:00:: 's Navy---navy%1:14:00:: , herding the hulks---hulk%1:06:00:: of the East Indies---location%1:03:00:: merchants---merchant%1:18:00:: and the yachts---yacht%1:06:00:: and ketches---ketch%1:06:00:: of the loyalists---loyalist%1:18:00:: .
The news---news%1:10:00:: of battle---battle%1:04:00:: on Breed 's Hill---location%1:03:00:: had already seeped through , and New York---new_york%1:15:01:: itself was now left in the hands---hands%1:04:00:: of the local Provincial Congress---group%1:03:00:: .
The fish hawk---fish_hawk%1:05:00:: , his wings---wing%1:05:00:: not moving , circled and glided lower .
The gilt sterns---stern%1:06:00:: of the men-of-war---man-of-war%1:06:00:: becoming clearer to him , the sides---side%1:06:00:: of the wooden sea---sea%1:17:00:: walls---wall%1:06:00:: alternately painted yellow---yellow%1:07:00:: and black , the bronze---bronze%1:27:00:: cannon---cannon%1:06:00:: at the ports---port%1:06:00:: .
The captain---captain%1:18:02:: 's gig---gig%1:06:02:: of H.M.S. Mercury was being rowed to H.M.S. Neptune .
On shore---shore%1:17:00:: `` the freed slaves---slave%1:18:00:: to despotism---despotism%1:26:00:: '' - the town---town%1:15:00:: dwellers---dweller%1:18:00:: - watched the ships---ship%1:06:00:: and waited .
The chevaux de frise---chevaux-de-frise%1:06:00:: , those sharp stakes---stake%1:10:00:: and barriers---barrier%1:06:00:: around the fort---fort%1:06:01:: at the Battery---location%1:03:00:: , pointed to a conflict---conflict%1:26:00:: between the town---town%1:14:00:: and sea power---sea_power%1:07:00:: rolling in glassy swells---swell%1:11:00:: as the tide---tide%1:11:00:: came in .
Across the bay---bay%1:17:00:: the Palisades---location%1:03:00:: were heavy in green timber---timber%1:27:00:: ; their rock---rock%1:27:00:: paths---path%1:06:00:: led down to the Hudson---hudson%1:17:00:: .
Below in the open bay---bay%1:17:00:: facing Manhattan---manhattan%1:15:00:: was Staten Island---staten_island%1:15:00:: , gritty with clam shells---clamshell%1:05:00:: and mud flats---mud_flat%1:15:00:: behind which nested farms---farm%1:06:00:: , cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: barns---barn%1:06:00:: , and berry---berry%1:13:00:: thickets---thicket%1:14:00:: .
Along Wappinger Creek---location%1:03:00:: in Dutchess County---location%1:03:00:: , past the white church---church%1:06:00:: at Fishkill---location%1:03:00:: , past Verplanck 's Point---location%1:03:00:: on the east bank---bank%1:17:01:: of the Hudson---hudson%1:17:00:: , to the white salt---salt%1:27:00:: crusted roads---road%1:06:00:: of the Long Island Rockaways---location%1:03:00:: there was a watching---watching%1:04:00:: and an activity---activity%1:04:00:: of preparing for something explosive to happen .
Today---today%1:28:00:: , tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:00:: , six months---month%1:28:01:: , even perhaps a year---year%1:28:01:: .
The fish hawk---fish_hawk%1:05:00:: flew on and was lost from sight---sight%1:10:00:: .
The British---british%1:18:00:: ships---ship%1:06:00:: rolled at anchor---anchor%1:06:00:: , sent out picket boats---picket_boat%1:06:00:: and waited for orders---order%1:10:03:: from London---location%1:03:00:: .
Waited for more ships---ship%1:06:00:: , more lobster-backed infantry---infantry%1:14:00:: , and asked what was to be done with a war---war%1:04:00:: of rebellion---rebellion%1:04:00:: ?
David Cortlandt---person%1:03:00:: , having slept away a day---day%1:28:02:: and a night---night%1:28:00:: , came awake in a plank---plank%1:27:00:: farmhouse---farmhouse%1:06:00:: on the Harlem River---location%1:03:00:: near Spuyten Duyvil---location%1:03:00:: .
He looked out through windowpanes---windowpane%1:06:00:: turned a faint violet---violet%1:07:00:: by sun---sun%1:19:00:: and weather---weather%1:19:00:: , looked out at King 's Bridge---location%1:03:00:: toward Westchester---location%1:03:00:: .
The road---road%1:06:00:: seemed animated with a few more wagons---wagon%1:06:00:: than usual ; a carriage---carriage%1:06:00:: raising up the choking June---june%1:28:00:: dust---dust%1:27:00:: , and beyond , in a meadow---meadow%1:15:00:: , a local militia---militia%1:14:00:: company---company%1:14:03:: drilling with muskets---musket%1:06:00:: , Kentuck ' rifles---rifle%1:06:00:: , every kind---kind%1:09:00:: of horse---horse%1:05:00:: pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: , old sword---sword%1:06:00:: , or cutlass---cutlass%1:06:00:: .
The wraith-like events---event%1:03:00:: of the last few days---day%1:28:01:: flooded David---person%1:03:00:: 's mind---mind%1:09:00:: and he rubbed his unshaved chin---chin%1:08:00:: and felt again the ache---ache%1:26:00:: in his kidneys---kidney%1:08:00:: caused by his saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: odyssey---odyssey%1:04:00:: from Boston---boston%1:15:00:: .
He had sent the dispatches---dispatch%1:10:00:: downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: to the proper people---people%1:14:00:: and had slept .
Orders---order%1:10:03:: not written down had to be transmitted to the local provincial government---government%1:14:00:: .
He scratched his mosquito---mosquito%1:05:00:: plagued neck---neck%1:08:00:: .
From the saddlebags---saddlebag%1:06:00:: , hung on a Hitchcock chair , David---person%1:03:00:: took out a good English---english%1:18:00:: razor---razor%1:06:00:: , a present---present%1:21:00:: from John Hunter---person%1:03:00:: .
He found tepid water---water%1:27:00:: in a pitcher---pitcher%1:06:00:: and a last bit---bite%1:26:00:: of soap---soap%1:06:00:: , and he lathered his face---face%1:08:00:: and stood stropping the razor---razor%1:06:00:: on his broad leather---leather%1:27:00:: belt---belt%1:06:00:: , its buckle---buckle%1:06:00:: held firm by a knob---knob%1:06:01:: of the bedpost---bedpost%1:06:00:: .
He hoped he was free of self-deception---self-deception%1:09:00:: .
Here he was , suddenly caught up in the delirium---delirium%1:26:01:: of a war---war%1:04:00:: , in the spite---spite%1:12:00:: and calumny---calumny%1:10:00:: of Whigs---whig%1:18:00:: and Tories---tory%1:18:01:: .
There would be great need---need%1:26:00:: soon for his skill---skill%1:09:00:: as surgeon---surgeon%1:18:00:: , but somehow he had not planned to use his knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: merely for war---war%1:04:00:: .
David Cortlandt---person%1:03:00:: had certain psychic intuitions---intuition%1:09:00:: that this rebellion---rebellion%1:04:00:: was not wholly what it appeared on the surface---surface%1:09:00:: .
He knew that many were using it for their own ends---end%1:09:02:: .
He stropped the razor---razor%1:06:00:: slowly ; what mattered was that a new concept---concept%1:09:00:: of Americans---american%1:18:00:: was being born .
That some men---man%1:18:00:: did not want it he could understand .
The moral aridity---aridity%1:07:00:: of merchants---merchant%1:18:00:: made them loyal usually to their ledgers---ledger%1:21:00:: .
Yet some , like Morris Manderscheid---person%1:03:00:: , would bankrupt themselves for the new ideas---idea%1:09:00:: .
Unique circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: would test us all , he decided .
Injury---injury%1:26:00:: and ingratitude---ingratitude%1:12:00:: would occur .
No doubt John Hancock---person%1:03:00:: would do well now ; war---war%1:04:00:: was a smugglers---smuggler%1:18:00:: ' heaven---heaven%1:15:01:: .
And what of that poor tarred and feathered wretch---wretch%1:18:00:: he had seen on the road---road%1:06:00:: driving down from Schuyler---person%1:03:00:: 's ?
Things---thing%1:26:00:: like that would increase rather than be done away with .
One had to believe in final events---event%1:03:00:: or one was stranded in the abyss---abyss%1:17:00:: of nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
He saw with John Hunter---person%1:03:00:: now that the perfectability of man was a dream---dream%1:09:01:: .
Life---life%1:09:00:: was a short play---play%1:10:03:: of tenebrous shadows---shadow%1:09:00:: .
David---person%1:03:00:: began to shave with great sweeping strokes---stroke%1:11:00:: .
Time---time%1:03:00:: plays an essential part---part%1:04:01:: in our mortality---mortality%1:07:00:: , and suddenly for no reason---reason%1:10:01:: he could imagine ( or admit ) the image---image%1:09:00:: of Peg---person%1:03:00:: laughing filled his mind---mind%1:09:00:: - so desirable , so lusty , so full of nuances---nuance%1:10:00:: of pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: and joy---joy%1:12:00:: .
He drove sensual patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: off , carefully shaving his long upper lip---lip%1:08:00:: .
It is harder , he muttered , to meditate on man---man%1:18:00:: ( or woman---woman%1:18:00:: ) than on God---god%1:18:00:: .
David---person%1:03:00:: finished shaving , washed his face---face%1:08:00:: clean of lather---lather%1:17:00:: , and combed and retied his hair---hair%1:08:00:: .
He was proud that he had never worn a wig---wig%1:06:00:: .
More and more of the colonials---colonial%1:18:00:: were wearing their own hair---hair%1:08:00:: and not using powder---powder%1:06:01:: .
He felt cheerful again , refreshed ; presentable in his wide-cut brown suit---suit%1:06:00:: , the well-made riding boots---riding_boot%1:06:00:: .
It is so easy to falsify sentiment---sentiment%1:12:00:: .
In the meadow---meadow%1:15:00:: below , militia---militia%1:14:00:: officers---officer%1:18:03:: shouted at their men---men%1:14:00:: and on King 's Bridge---location%1:03:00:: two boys---boy%1:18:00:: sat fishing .
The future---future%1:28:00:: would happen ; he did not have to hurry it by thinking too much .
A man---man%1:18:00:: could be tossed outside the dimension---dimension%1:07:00:: of time---time%1:28:04:: by a stray bullet---bullet%1:06:00:: these days---day%1:28:03:: .
He began to pack the saddlebags---saddlebag%1:06:00:: .
And all this too shall pass away : it came to him out of some dim corner---corner%1:15:02:: of memory---memory%1:09:02:: from a church service---church_service%1:04:00:: when he was a boy---boy%1:18:00:: - yes---yes%1:10:00:: , in a white church---church%1:06:00:: with a thin spur---spur%1:25:00:: steeple---steeple%1:06:00:: in the patriarchal Hudson Valley---location%1:03:00:: , where a feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: of plenitude---plenitude%1:07:00:: was normal in those English Dutch manors---manor%1:06:00:: with their well-fed squires---squire%1:18:00:: .
Apart from the honeybee---honeybee%1:05:00:: , practically all bees---bee%1:05:00:: and bumblebees---bumblebee%1:05:00:: hibernate in a state---state%1:03:00:: of torpor---torpor%1:26:00:: .
Occasionally , you may come across one or two bumblebees---bumblebee%1:05:00:: in the cold season---season%1:28:00:: , when you are turning over sods---sod%1:17:00:: in your garden---garden%1:06:00:: , but you have to be a really keen observer---observer%1:18:00:: to see them at all .
They keep their wings---wing%1:05:00:: and feet---foot%1:05:00:: pressed tightly against their bodies---body%1:08:00:: , and in spite of their often colorful attire---attire%1:06:00:: you may very well mistake them for lumps---lump%1:14:00:: of dirt---dirt%1:27:01:: .
I must add at once that these animals---animal%1:03:00:: are what we call `` queens---queen%1:05:01:: '' , young females---female%1:05:00:: that have mated in the previous summer---summer%1:28:00:: or autumn---autumn%1:28:00:: .
It is on them alone that the future---future%1:28:00:: of their race---race%1:14:01:: depends , for all their relatives---relative%1:05:00:: ( mothers---mother%1:18:00:: , husbands---husband%1:18:00:: , brothers---brother%1:18:00:: , and unmated sisters---sister%1:18:00:: ) have perished with the arrival---arrival%1:04:00:: of the cold weather---cold_weather%1:19:00:: .
Even some of the queens---queen%1:05:01:: will die before the winter---winter%1:28:00:: is over , falling prey---prey%1:18:00:: to enemies---enemy%1:18:00:: or disease---disease%1:26:00:: .
The survivors---survivor%1:05:00:: emerge on some nice , sunny day---day%1:28:01:: in March---march%1:28:00:: or April---april%1:28:00:: , when the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: is close to 50 ` F---f%1:23:02:: and there is not too much wind---wind%1:19:00:: .
Now---now%1:28:00:: the thing---thing%1:04:00:: for us to do is to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flowering---flowering%1:22:00:: currants---currant%1:13:01:: such as the red Ribes sanguineum---ribes_sanguineum%1:20:00:: of our Pacific Northwest---location%1:03:00:: , or otherwise a good sloe---sloe%1:20:02:: tree---tree%1:20:00:: , or perhaps some nice pussy willow---pussy_willow%1:20:01:: in bloom , preferably one with male or staminate catkins---catkin%1:20:00:: .
The blooms---bloom%1:20:00:: of Ribes---ribes%1:20:00:: and of the willow---willow%1:20:00:: and sloe---sloe%1:20:02:: are the places---place%1:15:00:: where large numbers---large_number%1:23:00:: of our early insects---insect%1:05:00:: will assemble : honeybees---honeybee%1:05:00:: , bumblebees---bumblebee%1:05:00:: , and other wild bees---bee%1:05:00:: , and also various kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of flies---fly%1:05:00:: .
It is a happy , buzzing crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: .
Each male willow---willow%1:20:00:: catkin---catkin%1:20:00:: is composed of a large number---large_number%1:23:00:: of small flowers---flower%1:20:00:: .
It is not difficult to see that the stamens---stamen%1:20:00:: of the catkin---catkin%1:20:00:: are always arranged in pairs---pair%1:14:00:: , and that each individual flower---flower%1:20:00:: is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but one---one%1:23:00:: such pair---pair%1:14:01:: standing on a green , black tipped little scale---scale%1:20:00:: .
By scrutinizing the flowers---flower%1:20:00:: , one can also notice that the scale---scale%1:20:00:: bears one or two tiny warts---wart%1:25:00:: .
Those are the nectaries---nectary%1:20:00:: or honey---honey%1:13:00:: glands---gland%1:08:00:: ( Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 26 , page---page%1:10:00:: 74 ) .
The staminate willow---willow%1:20:00:: catkins---catkin%1:20:00:: , then , provide their visitors---visitor%1:18:00:: with both nectar---nectar%1:27:00:: and pollen---pollen%1:20:00:: ; a marvelous arrangement , for it provides exactly what the bee---bee%1:05:00:: queens---queen%1:05:01:: need to make their beebread---beebread%1:27:00:: , a combination---combination%1:14:00:: of honey---honey%1:13:00:: and pollen---pollen%1:20:00:: with which the young---young%1:05:00:: of all species---species%1:14:00:: are fed .
The only exception---exception%1:09:00:: to this is certain bees---bee%1:05:00:: that have become parasites---parasite%1:05:00:: .
Quite often , honeybees---honeybee%1:05:00:: form a majority---majority%1:07:00:: on the willow---willow%1:20:00:: catkins---catkin%1:20:00:: .
As we have already seen in the first chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: , bumblebees---bumblebee%1:05:00:: are bigger , hairier , and much more colorful than honeybees---honeybee%1:05:00:: , exhibiting various combinations---combination%1:14:00:: of black---black%1:07:00:: , yellow---yellow%1:07:00:: , white---white%1:07:00:: and orange---orange%1:07:00:: .
Let us not try to key them out at this stage---stage%1:28:00:: of the game---game%1:04:01:: , and let us just call them Bombus---bombus%1:05:00:: ; there must be several dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: species---species%1:14:00:: in the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: alone .
If you really insist on knowing their names---name%1:10:00:: , an excellent book---book%1:10:00:: on the North American species---species%1:14:00:: is Bumblebees---bumblebee%1:05:00:: and Their Ways---way%1:04:00:: by O. E. Plath---person%1:03:00:: .
If we manage to keep track---track%1:09:00:: of a Bombus---bombus%1:05:00:: queen---queen%1:05:01:: after she has left her feeding---feeding%1:04:00:: place---place%1:15:00:: , we may discover the snug little hideout---hideout%1:15:00:: which she has fixed up for herself when she woke up from her winter---winter%1:28:00:: sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: .
As befits a queen---queen%1:05:01:: , a bumblebee---bumblebee%1:05:00:: female---female%1:05:00:: is rather choosy and may spend considerable time---time%1:28:05:: searching for a suitable nesting place---nesting_place%1:15:00:: .
Most species---species%1:14:00:: seem to prefer a ready-made hollow---hollow%1:17:00:: such as a deserted mouse nest---mouse_nest%1:17:00:: , a bird house---birdhouse%1:06:00:: , or the hole---hole%1:17:01:: made by a woodpecker---woodpecker%1:05:00:: ; some show a definite liking---liking%1:12:00:: for making their nest---nest%1:17:00:: in moss---moss%1:20:00:: .
Once she has made up her mind , the queen---queen%1:05:01:: starts out by constructing , in her chosen abode---abode%1:06:00:: , a small `` floor---floor%1:06:00:: '' of dried grass---grass%1:20:00:: or some woolly material---material%1:27:00:: .
On this , she builds an `` egg---egg%1:05:00:: compartment---compartment%1:06:01:: '' or `` egg---egg%1:05:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: '' which is filled with that famous pollen---pollen%1:20:00:: and nectar---nectar%1:27:00:: mixture---mixture%1:13:00:: called beebread---beebread%1:27:00:: .
She also builds one or two waxen cups---cup%1:25:00:: which she fills with honey---honey%1:13:00:: .
Then , a group---group%1:03:00:: of eggs---egg%1:05:00:: is deposited in a cavity---cavity%1:17:00:: in the beebread---beebread%1:27:00:: loaf---loaf%1:13:00:: and the egg---egg%1:05:00:: compartment---compartment%1:06:01:: is closed .
The queen---queen%1:05:01:: afterward keeps incubating and guarding her eggs---egg%1:05:00:: like a mother---mother%1:18:00:: hen---hen%1:05:01:: , taking a sip---sip%1:04:01:: from time to time from the rather liquid honey---honey%1:13:00:: in her honey---honey%1:13:00:: pots---pot%1:23:00:: .
When the larvae---larva%1:05:00:: hatch , they feed on the beebread---beebread%1:27:00:: , although they also receive extra honey---honey%1:13:00:: meals---meal%1:13:00:: from their mother---mother%1:18:00:: .
She continues to add to the pollen---pollen%1:20:00:: supply---supply%1:23:00:: as needed .
The larvae---larva%1:05:00:: , kept warm by the queen---queen%1:05:01:: , are full grown in about ten days---day%1:28:00:: .
Each now makes a tough , papery cocoon---cocoon%1:05:00:: and pupates .
After another two weeks---two_weeks%1:28:00:: , the first young---young%1:05:00:: emerge , four to eight small daughters---daughter%1:18:00:: that begin to play the role---role%1:04:00:: of worker bees---worker_bee%1:05:00:: , collecting pollen---pollen%1:20:00:: and nectar---nectar%1:27:00:: in the field---field%1:15:00:: and caring for the new young generation---generation%1:14:00:: while the queen---queen%1:05:01:: retires to a life---life%1:26:02:: of egg laying---egg_laying%1:22:00:: .
The first worker bees---worker_bee%1:05:00:: do not mate or lay eggs---egg%1:05:00:: ; males---male%1:05:00:: and mating---mating%1:04:00:: females---female%1:05:00:: do not emerge until later in the season---season%1:28:00:: .
The broods---brood%1:14:00:: of workers---worker%1:05:01:: that appear later tend to be bigger than the first ones , probably because they are better fed .
By the middle of the summer---summer%1:28:00:: , many of the larvae---larva%1:05:00:: apparently receive such a good diet---diet%1:13:00:: that it is `` optimal '' , and it is then that young queens---queen%1:05:01:: begin to appear .
Simultaneously , males---male%1:05:00:: or drones---drone%1:05:00:: are produced , mostly from the unfertilized eggs---egg%1:05:00:: of workers---worker%1:05:01:: , although a few may be produced by the queen---queen%1:05:01:: .
The young queens---queen%1:05:01:: and drones---drone%1:05:00:: leave the nest---nest%1:17:00:: and mate , and after a short period---period%1:28:00:: of freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: , the fertilized young queens---queen%1:05:01:: will begin to dig in for the winter---winter%1:28:00:: .
It is an amazing fact---fact%1:09:01:: that in some species---species%1:14:00:: this will happen while the summer---summer%1:28:00:: is still in full swing , for instance , in August---august%1:28:00:: .
The temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: then is still very high .
At the old nest---nest%1:17:00:: , the queen---queen%1:05:01:: will in the early fall---fall%1:28:00:: cease to lay the fertilized eggs---egg%1:05:00:: that will produce females---female%1:05:00:: .
As a result---result%1:19:00:: , the proportion---proportion%1:24:00:: of males---male%1:05:00:: ( which leave the nest---nest%1:17:00:: ) increases , and eventually the old colony---colony%1:14:01:: will die out completely .
The nest---nest%1:17:00:: itself , the structure---structure%1:06:00:: that in some cases---case%1:11:00:: housed about 2000 individuals---individual%1:18:00:: when the season---season%1:28:00:: was at its peak---peak%1:28:00:: , is now rapidly destroyed by the scavenging larvae---larva%1:05:00:: of certain beetles---beetle%1:05:00:: and moths---moth%1:05:00:: .
Not always , though , does the development---development%1:22:01:: of a bumblebee---bumblebee%1:05:00:: colony---colony%1:14:01:: take place in the smooth fashion---fashion%1:04:00:: we have just described .
Some members---member%1:24:00:: of the bee---bee%1:05:00:: family---family%1:14:03:: have become idlers---idler%1:18:00:: , social parasites---parasite%1:05:00:: that live at the expense---expense%1:21:00:: of their hardworking relatives---relative%1:05:00:: .
Bumblebees---bumblebee%1:05:00:: can thus suffer severely from the onslaughts---onslaught%1:11:00:: of Psithyrus , the `` cuckoo bumblebee---cuckoo-bumblebee%1:05:00:: '' as it is called in some European countries---european_country%1:15:00:: .
Female---female%1:05:00:: individuals---individual%1:18:00:: of Psithyrus---psithyrus%1:05:00:: look deceptively like the workers---worker%1:05:01:: and queens---queen%1:05:01:: of the bumblebees---bumblebee%1:05:00:: they victimize .
The one sure way---way%1:04:01:: to tell victim---victim%1:18:00:: and villain---villain%1:18:00:: apart is to examine the hind legs---hind_leg%1:05:00:: which in the case---case%1:26:00:: of the idler---idler%1:18:00:: , Psithyrus---psithyrus%1:05:00:: , lack the pollen---pollen%1:20:00:: baskets---basket%1:23:00:: - naturally !
The female parasite---parasite%1:05:00:: spends much time---time%1:28:05:: in her efforts---effort%1:04:00:: to find a nest---nest%1:17:00:: of her host---host%1:05:00:: .
When she succeeds , she usually manages to slip in unobtrusively , to deposit an egg---egg%1:05:00:: on a completed loaf---loaf%1:13:00:: of beebread---beebread%1:27:00:: before the bumblebees---bumblebee%1:05:00:: seal the egg---egg%1:05:00:: compartment---compartment%1:06:01:: .
The hosts---host%1:05:00:: never seem to recognize that something is amiss , so that the compartment---compartment%1:06:01:: afterward is sealed normally .
Thus , the larvae---larva%1:05:00:: of the intruder---intruder%1:18:00:: can develop at the expense---expense%1:21:00:: of the rightful inhabitants---inhabitant%1:18:00:: and the store---store%1:21:00:: of beebread---beebread%1:27:00:: .
Later on , they and the mother---mother%1:18:00:: Psithyrus---psithyrus%1:05:00:: are fed by the Bombus---bombus%1:05:00:: workers---worker%1:05:01:: .
Worse still , in a number---number%1:07:00:: of cases---case%1:26:00:: it has been claimed that the Psithyrus---psithyrus%1:05:00:: female---female%1:05:00:: kills off the Bombus---bombus%1:05:00:: queen---queen%1:05:01:: .
But let us return , after this gruesome interlude---interlude%1:28:00:: , to our willow---willow%1:20:00:: catkins---catkin%1:20:00:: in the spring---spring%1:28:00:: ; there are other wild bees---bee%1:05:00:: that command our attention---attention%1:09:00:: .
It is almost certain that some of these , usually a trifle smaller than the honeybees---honeybee%1:05:00:: , are andrenas or mining bees---mining_bee%1:05:00:: .
There are about 200 different kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of Andrena---andrena%1:05:00:: in Europe---europe%1:17:00:: alone .
One of my favorites---favorite%1:09:00:: is A. armata , a species---species%1:14:00:: very common in England---england%1:15:00:: , where it is sometimes referred to as the lawn---lawn%1:15:00:: bee---bee%1:05:00:: .
The females---female%1:05:00:: like to burrow in the short turf---turf%1:17:00:: of well-kept lawns---lawn%1:15:00:: , where their little mounds---mound%1:14:00:: of earth---earth%1:27:00:: often appear by the hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: .
Almost equal in size---size%1:07:00:: to a honeybee---honeybee%1:05:00:: .
A. armata is much more beautiful in color---color%1:07:00:: , at least in the female---female%1:05:00:: of the species---species%1:14:00:: : a rich , velvety , rusty red .
The males---male%1:05:00:: are much duller .
After having mated , an Andrena---andrena%1:05:00:: female---female%1:05:00:: digs a hole---hole%1:17:01:: straight down into the ground---ground%1:17:00:: , forming a burrow---burrow%1:17:00:: about the size---size%1:07:00:: of a lead pencil---lead_pencil%1:06:01:: .
The bottom---bottom%1:15:00:: part---part%1:17:00:: of a burrow---burrow%1:17:00:: has a number---number%1:07:00:: of side tunnels---tunnel%1:06:00:: or `` cells---cell%1:06:03:: '' , each of which is provided with an egg---egg%1:05:00:: plus a store---store%1:21:00:: of beebread---beebread%1:27:00:: .
The development---development%1:22:01:: of the Andrena---andrena%1:05:00:: larvae---larva%1:05:00:: is very rapid , so that by the end---end%1:28:00:: of spring---spring%1:28:00:: they have already pupated and become adults---adult%1:05:00:: .
But they are still enclosed in their larval cells---cell%1:06:03:: and remain there throughout the summer---summer%1:28:00:: , fall---fall%1:28:00:: , and winter---winter%1:28:00:: .
Their appearance---appearance%1:11:00:: , next spring---spring%1:28:00:: , coincides in an almost uncanny way---way%1:07:01:: with the flowering---flowering%1:22:00:: of their host---host%1:05:00:: plants---plant%1:03:00:: .
In the Sacramento---sacramento%1:15:00:: valley---valley%1:17:00:: in California---california%1:15:00:: , for instance , it has been observed that there was not one day---day%1:28:00:: 's difference---difference%1:07:00:: between the emergence---emergence%1:11:00:: of the andrenas and the opening---opening%1:04:02:: of the willow---willow%1:20:00:: catkins---catkin%1:20:00:: .
This must be due to a completely identical response---response%1:04:01:: to the weather---weather%1:19:00:: , in the plant---plant%1:03:00:: and the animal---animal%1:03:00:: .
After the male and female andrenas have mated , the cycle---cycle%1:28:00:: is repeated .
Although Andrena---andrena%1:05:00:: is gregarious , so that we may find hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: and hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of burrows---burrow%1:17:00:: together , we must still call it a solitary bee---bee%1:05:00:: .
Its life history---life_history%1:10:00:: is much simpler than that of the truly colonial bumblebees---bumblebee%1:05:00:: and can serve as an example---example%1:09:02:: of the life cycle---life_cycle%1:19:00:: of many other species---species%1:14:00:: .
After all , social life---life%1:26:01:: in the group---group%1:03:00:: of the bees---bee%1:05:00:: is by no means general , although it certainly is a striking feature---feature%1:09:00:: .
On the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of its life history---life_history%1:10:00:: , we like to think that Andrena---andrena%1:05:00:: is more primitive than the bumblebees---bumblebee%1:05:00:: .
The way---way%1:07:01:: in which it transports its pollen---pollen%1:20:00:: is not so perfect , either .
It lacks pollen---pollen%1:20:00:: baskets---basket%1:23:00:: and possesses only a large number---large_number%1:23:00:: of long , branched hairs---hair%1:08:00:: on its legs---leg%1:08:02:: , on which the pollen---pollen%1:20:00:: grains---grain%1:17:00:: will collect .
Still Andrena---andrena%1:05:00:: will do a reasonably good job---job%1:04:01:: , so that an animal---animal%1:03:00:: with a full pollen---pollen%1:20:00:: load---load%1:06:00:: looks like a gay little piece---piece%1:17:00:: of yellow---yellow%1:07:00:: down---down%1:05:00:: floating in the wind---wind%1:19:00:: .
Closely related to the andrenas---andrena%1:05:00:: are the nomias---nomia%1:05:00:: or alkali bees---alkali_bee%1:05:00:: .
Nomia melanderi---nomia_melanderi%1:05:00:: can be found in tremendous numbers---number%1:23:00:: in certain parts---part%1:15:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: west---west%1:24:00:: of the Great Plains---location%1:03:00:: , for example , in Utah---utah%1:15:00:: and central Washington---washington%1:15:00:: .
In the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: Department of Agriculture---department_of_agriculture%1:14:00:: 's Yearbook of Agriculture , 1952 , which is devoted entirely to insects---insect%1:05:00:: , George E. Bohart---person%1:03:00:: mentions a site---site%1:15:02:: in Utah---utah%1:15:00:: which was estimated to contain 200000 nesting females---female%1:05:00:: .
Often the burrows---burrow%1:17:00:: are only an inch---inch%1:23:00:: or two apart , and the bee---bee%1:05:00:: cities---city%1:15:00:: cover several acres---acres%1:21:00:: .
The life history---life_history%1:10:00:: of the alkali bee---alkali_bee%1:05:00:: is similar to that of Andrena---andrena%1:05:00:: , but the first activity---activity%1:26:00:: of the adults---adult%1:05:00:: does not take place until summer---summer%1:28:00:: , and the individuals---individual%1:18:00:: hibernate in the prepupal stage---stage%1:26:00:: .
In most places---place%1:15:01:: , there are two generations---generation%1:14:00:: a year---year%1:28:01:: , a second brood---brood%1:14:00:: of adults---adult%1:05:00:: appearing late in the summer---summer%1:28:00:: .
I must plead guilty to a special sympathy---sympathy%1:09:00:: for nomias---nomia%1:05:00:: .
This may just be pride---pride%1:12:00:: in my adopted State of Washington---location%1:03:00:: , but certainly I love to visit their mound---mound%1:17:00:: cities---city%1:15:00:: near Yakima---location%1:03:00:: and Prosser---location%1:03:00:: in July---july%1:28:00:: or August---august%1:28:00:: , when the bees---bee%1:05:00:: are in their most active period---period%1:28:00:: .
The name---name%1:10:00:: `` alkali bee---alkali_bee%1:05:00:: '' indicates that one has to look for them in rather inhospitable places---place%1:15:00:: .
The thing---thing%1:26:00:: is that these bees---bee%1:05:00:: love a fine-grained soil---soil%1:27:01:: that is moist ; yet the water---water%1:27:00:: in the ground---ground%1:17:00:: should not be stagnant either .
They dislike dense vegetation---vegetation%1:14:00:: .
Where does one find such conditions---condition%1:26:00:: ?
The best chance---chance%1:26:00:: , of course , is offered by gently sloping terrain---terrain%1:15:00:: where the water---water%1:27:00:: remains close to the surface---surface%1:17:00:: and where the air---air%1:27:00:: is dry , so that a high evaporation---evaporation%1:22:00:: leaves salty deposits---deposit%1:17:00:: which permit only sparse plant---plant%1:03:00:: growth---growth%1:14:00:: .
One day---day%1:28:03:: , the children---child%1:18:00:: had wanted to get up onto General Burnside---person%1:03:00:: 's horse---horse%1:05:00:: .
They wanted to see what his back---back%1:08:00:: felt like - the General---person%1:03:00:: 's .
They wanted to touch the mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: .
Arlene---person%1:03:00:: was boosting them up when the policeman---policeman%1:18:00:: came by .
Arlene---person%1:03:00:: had a hard voice---voice%1:07:00:: , too , this time---time%1:11:00:: .
The policeman---policeman%1:18:00:: 's eyes---eye%1:08:00:: rather popped for a second---second%1:28:00:: ; but then Arlene---person%1:03:00:: got another tone---tone%1:10:01:: in a hurry---hurry%1:26:00:: , and she said , `` If it was n't for these dear children---child%1:18:00:: '' - .
The policeman---policeman%1:18:00:: got a confused , funny look---look%1:07:01:: on his face---face%1:08:00:: , and he had answered kind of politely , `` Now , look here , lady---lady%1:18:02:: : I know you got to entertain these kids---kid%1:18:00:: and all .
But this is a public park---park%1:15:01:: and it 's a city---city%1:15:01:: ordinance---ordinance%1:10:00:: that the statues---statue%1:06:00:: cannot be crawled on '' .
Arlene---person%1:03:00:: was so ashamed that she hung her head---head%1:08:00:: when she said , `` Yes , sir '' .
The policeman---policeman%1:18:00:: walked on , but he looked back once .
That had happened on the day---day%1:28:01:: when two other unusual things---thing%1:11:00:: had occurred .
Arlene---person%1:03:00:: had taught them a new way---way%1:04:01:: to have fun---fun%1:04:00:: in their little private area---area%1:15:01:: ; and they had told their mother---mother%1:18:00:: about the tumbles---tumble%1:04:00:: .
In matters---matter%1:09:00:: of exact information---information%1:10:00:: , that kept her one step---step%1:26:00:: behind developments---development%1:11:01:: ; and so they were consistently true to their principles---principle%1:09:01:: .
`` Never mind '' , Arlene---person%1:03:00:: had said , after the policeman---policeman%1:18:00:: had left , having pursued the usual unco-operative course---course%1:04:00:: of grownups---grownup%1:18:01:: .
I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn---lawn%1:15:00:: '' .
`` What is it '' ? asked the children---child%1:18:00:: , whose reflexes---reflex%1:04:00:: and replies---reply%1:10:01:: were invariably so admirably normal and predictable .
Maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability---unpredictability%1:07:02:: of Arlene---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene---person%1:03:00:: , echoing the dialogue---dialogue%1:10:02:: in a recent British movie---movie%1:10:00:: .
And when they had got to their little lawn---lawn%1:15:00:: , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time---time%1:11:01:: .
First , Arlene---person%1:03:00:: had put them through some rapid somersaults---somersault%1:04:00:: .
They had protested that that was n't any surprise---surprise%1:11:00:: .
`` Just you wait '' , said Arlene---person%1:03:00:: again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations---insinuation%1:10:00:: of that handy little sturdy statement---statement%1:10:00:: .
`` This is a warm-up---warm-up%1:04:00:: '' .
`` Is it anything like cooked over oatmeal---oatmeal%1:13:00:: '' ? asked one of the children---child%1:18:00:: .
`` Not the least bit '' , Arlene---person%1:03:00:: snapped .
One---one%1:23:00:: of the many things---thing%1:07:00:: that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions---question%1:10:00:: seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions---question%1:10:00:: .
Those were especially the ones that all other grownups---grownup%1:18:01:: laughed at loudest .
`` Now '' , said Arlene---person%1:03:00:: , eventually , making them both sit in formation---formation%1:14:00:: on a big root---root%1:20:00:: of a live oak---live_oak%1:20:00:: , the sort---sort%1:09:00:: of root---root%1:20:00:: that divided itself and made their bottoms---bottom%1:08:00:: sag down and feel comfortable .
`` Now , we 're going to be like what General Burnside---person%1:03:00:: and his horse---horse%1:05:00:: make us think of '' .
The children---child%1:18:00:: looked at each other and sagged their bottoms---bottom%1:08:00:: down even more comfortably than ever .
Their curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: went happily out of bounds .
Then , Arlene---person%1:03:00:: threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way---way%1:07:01:: that was just wonderful .
She held herself that way---way%1:07:01:: and turned her head---head%1:08:00:: towards them and laughed and winked .
`` Imagine being able to laugh and wink when you 're like the top part---part%1:06:00:: of that picture frame---picture_frame%1:06:00:: at home---home%1:15:04:: '' , one of them said .
`` I'm General Burnside---person%1:03:00:: 's horse---horse%1:05:00:: , upside down '' , Arlene---person%1:03:00:: said , sort of gaspingly , for her : even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position---position%1:07:01:: .
She made General Burnside---person%1:03:00:: 's horse---horse%1:05:00:: 's belly---belly%1:08:00:: do so funny when it was upside down .
Then , she was back on her feet---foot%1:08:01:: , winking and smiling that enormous smile---smile%1:10:00:: ( she had lots---lots%1:23:00:: of wonderful big teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling ) .
And she would wink and throw kisses---kiss%1:04:00:: .
They both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: , but it made their lips---lip%1:08:00:: and eyelids---eyelid%1:08:00:: tremble .
But they kept on clapping for a long , long time---time%1:28:05:: .
`` This time---time%1:11:00:: '' , Arlene---person%1:03:00:: said , and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking , `` you 're going to tell me what I am and what I'm doing .
It all has something to do with General Burnside---person%1:03:00:: and his horse---horse%1:05:00:: '' .
This time---time%1:11:00:: , it was so grand ; they could tell exactly what it was .
It was General Burnside---person%1:03:00:: 's horse---horse%1:05:00:: running in a circle---circle%1:04:00:: .
His legs---leg%1:08:01:: shook , and the shaking---shaking%1:04:00:: went right on up his body---body%1:08:00:: through his hips---hip%1:08:01:: to his shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
`` That 's the General---general%1:18:00:: 's horse---horse%1:05:00:: '' , one of them cried out .
The other remarked , in a happy laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: , `` That 's a funny old horse---horse%1:05:00:: '' .
Then there was the General---general%1:18:00:: kissing his wife---wife%1:18:00:: .
Their father---father%1:18:00:: , when he came back from those many business---business%1:04:00:: trips---trip%1:04:00:: , just bumped their mother---mother%1:18:00:: on the forehead---forehead%1:08:00:: with his lips---lip%1:08:00:: and asked if anybody had thought to mix the martinis---martini%1:13:00:: and put them in the electric icebox---icebox%1:06:00:: .
But not General Burnside---person%1:03:00:: .
He was the funniest man---man%1:18:00:: .
He never could keep still , even when he did n't move his feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
Then , they had to get up and be General Burnside---person%1:03:00:: .
Or his horse---horse%1:05:00:: .
All they could think of was to run around in circles---circle%1:04:00:: , kicking their legs---leg%1:08:01:: out .
Then , they said General Burnside---person%1:03:00:: was going to jump over his horse---horse%1:05:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: ; and they did some somersaults---somersault%1:04:00:: .
`` You ought to shake '' , Arlene---person%1:03:00:: advised them .
And Arlene---person%1:03:00:: showed them how to begin .
She also taught them to sing `` I wish I could shimmy like my sister---sister%1:18:00:: Kate---person%1:03:00:: '' .
They also caught on a little bit on how to smile---smile%1:10:00:: a lot without your lips---lip%1:08:00:: trembling .
`` Imagine you won't get your allowance---allowance%1:21:00:: if you 're caught not smiling - or smiling with your lips---lip%1:08:00:: trembling too much '' , Arlene---person%1:03:00:: suggested .
`` I'm sorry , Mrs. Minks---person%1:03:00:: '' , Arlene---person%1:03:00:: said in a tone---tone%1:10:01:: so low you could hardly hear it .
My mother---mother%1:18:00:: constituted herself the voice---voice%1:18:00:: of all of us .
`` It 's perfectly understandable , Arlene---person%1:03:00:: '' , my mother---mother%1:18:00:: said in a friendly way---way%1:07:01:: .
`` Yes , ma'am '' , the children---child%1:18:00:: chorused heartily .
The children---child%1:18:00:: rushed off to get rid of their sweaters---sweater%1:06:00:: ; and Arlene---person%1:03:00:: began tapping the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:00:: open .
`` Arlene---person%1:03:00:: 's a good girl---girl%1:18:00:: '' , my uncle---uncle%1:18:00:: remarked to us ; but he said it too soon , for it came out just before the tap---tap%1:11:00:: to which the door---door%1:06:00:: responded .
That tap---tap%1:11:00:: had a slight bang---bang%1:11:00:: ish quality---quality%1:09:00:: .
`` She really is a dear little thing---thing%1:06:01:: '' , my mother---mother%1:18:00:: agreed .
Her upper lip---lip%1:08:00:: lifted slightly .
She was biting into a small red radish---radish%1:13:00:: ; and that action---action%1:04:02:: always caused her to lift her lip---lip%1:08:00:: from the sting---sting%1:26:00:: of the thing---thing%1:06:00:: .
Also , she lived in continual fear---fear%1:12:00:: of finding a white worm---worm%1:05:00:: curled up in a neat , mean little heap---heap%1:14:00:: at the white center---center%1:15:01:: of the radish---radish%1:13:00:: .
She would try to see over the bulge---bulge%1:25:00:: of her cheeks---cheek%1:08:00:: and somewhat under her teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: to the place---place%1:15:00:: where she was biting .
Also , when she had bitten off half---half%1:23:00:: of the small radish---radish%1:13:00:: , she found the suspense---suspense%1:12:02:: unbearable ; and she would snatch the finger---finger%1:08:00:: held half---half%1:23:00:: of the radish---radish%1:13:00:: out to where she could inspect it .
One could hear a very faint , ladylike sigh---sigh%1:10:00:: of relief---relief%1:12:00:: .
But the warm joy---joy%1:12:00:: of her brown eyes---eye%1:08:00:: was open to the general public---public%1:14:00:: .
Later on , the children---child%1:18:00:: told her further about somersaulting---somersaulting%1:04:00:: .
And awfully kind of Arlene---person%1:03:00:: '' , she told us later .
`` I reached into that funny little pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: that is high up on my dress---dress%1:06:00:: .
I have no notion---notion%1:09:02:: why I reached .
And I found a radish---radish%1:13:00:: .
Was it an omen---omen%1:11:00:: ?
I thought for a second---second%1:28:00:: .
But I would not pamper myself in that silly way---way%1:07:01:: .
I opened the window---window%1:06:00:: and threw the radish---radish%1:13:00:: out '' .
Then , my mother---mother%1:18:00:: blushed at this small lie---lie%1:10:00:: ; for she knew and we knew that it was cowardice---cowardice%1:07:00:: that had made one more radish---radish%1:13:00:: that night---night%1:28:00:: just too impossible a strain---strain%1:26:02:: .
Arlene---person%1:03:00:: became indispensable ; nobody could have told why .
A friend---friend%1:18:00:: of my father---father%1:18:00:: 's came to dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: .
He was passing through town---town%1:15:00:: and phoned to say hello .
As a result---result%1:11:00:: , he was persuaded out to dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: .
As a matter of fact , this happened every four or five months---month%1:28:00:: .
Sometimes , he coincided with my father---father%1:18:00:: 's being at home---home%1:15:04:: .
Sometimes , as at this juncture---juncture%1:11:00:: , he did not .
he liked children---child%1:18:00:: , in a loathsome kind---kind%1:09:00:: of way---way%1:07:01:: ; the two youngest in our family---family%1:14:00:: always had to be brought in and put through tricks---trick%1:04:00:: for his entertainment---entertainment%1:04:00:: .
When he had left , I could never remember whether he had poked them in their middles---middle%1:08:00:: , laughingly , with a thick index finger---index_finger%1:08:00:: or whether he was merely so much the sort---sort%1:09:00:: of person---person%1:03:00:: who did this that one assumed the action---action%1:04:02:: , not bothering to look .
The children---child%1:18:00:: loathed him , too .
This evening , they were pushed in from the breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: room---room%1:06:00:: , with odds and ends---odds_and_ends%1:14:00:: of dessert---dessert%1:13:00:: distributed over them .
There had been some coconut---coconut%1:13:02:: in it , for I remember my mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's taking a quick glance---glance%1:04:00:: at a stringy bit---bit%1:23:01:: of this nut---nut%1:20:00:: on the cheek---cheek%1:08:00:: of one of them and then putting down her radish---radish%1:13:00:: with a shiver---shiver%1:04:00:: .
They were pushed gently into the room---room%1:06:00:: by Arlene---person%1:03:00:: - whose only part---part%1:06:00:: appearing were hands---hand%1:08:00:: that crept quickly back around to the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: side---side%1:15:02:: of the door---door%1:06:00:: .
`` Tell Mr. Gorboduc---person%1:03:00:: what you 're doing these days---day%1:28:03:: '' , my mother---mother%1:18:00:: advised the children---child%1:18:00:: , ceremonially .
There was an air---air%1:07:00:: of revolt---revolt%1:04:00:: about the children---child%1:18:00:: - even irreverence---irreverence%1:09:00:: for their own principles---principle%1:09:01:: .
This could be told chiefly from a sort---sort%1:09:00:: of head---head%1:08:00:: tossing and prancing , a horse---horse%1:05:00:: like balkiness---balkiness%1:07:00:: of demeanor---demeanor%1:07:00:: .
Possibly , the coconut---coconut%1:13:02:: containing dessert---dessert%1:13:00:: had brought up bitter problems---problem%1:26:00:: of administration---administration%1:04:00:: .
But , at the beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: , this stayed just in the air .
`` We go to the park---park%1:15:01:: with this nice lady---lady%1:18:02:: '' , one of them said .
`` We have good times---time%1:11:01:: '' .
This happy bulletin---bulletin%1:10:00:: convulsed Mr. Gorboduc---person%1:03:00:: .
`` You do '' ? he asked , between wheezes---wheeze%1:04:00:: of laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: .
He was forced to wipe his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
`` You do n't step on the flowers---flower%1:20:00:: , do you ?
One of the children---child%1:18:00:: maneuvered out of range---range%1:15:01:: of the poking index finger---index_finger%1:08:00:: .
Mr. Gorboduc---person%1:03:00:: took a swig---swig%1:04:00:: of his sherry---sherry%1:13:00:: .
He was so long thinking that my mother---mother%1:18:00:: had time---time%1:28:05:: to inspect her sherry---sherry%1:13:00:: for dregs---dregs%1:17:00:: .
Usually , this was done when attention---attention%1:09:00:: was diverted by someone---someone%1:03:00:: else 's long , boring story---story%1:10:03:: .
But this time---time%1:11:00:: she was nervous : she was open .
Mr. Gorboduc---person%1:03:00:: was finally in command---command%1:09:00:: of his mind---mind%1:09:00:: again .
`` Tell me - what do you do at the park---park%1:15:01:: '' ? he asked .
This was delivered in a forthright way---way%1:07:01:: , without coyness---coyness%1:07:00:: and over pretended interest---interest%1:09:00:: - an admirable way---way%1:07:01:: with children---child%1:18:00:: .
Only , unfortunately , he could not remove from his voice---voice%1:07:00:: a nagging insinuation---insinuation%1:10:00:: of the direct command---command%1:10:00:: .
This nettled the children---child%1:18:00:: into the revelation---revelation%1:10:02:: of exact truth---truth%1:10:00:: , a sacrifice---sacrifice%1:04:01:: of their secret superiority---superiority%1:07:01:: over grown people---people%1:14:00:: , but a victory---victory%1:11:00:: in the wide fields---field%1:26:00:: of perpetration---perpetration%1:04:00:: and illegitimate accomplishment---accomplishment%1:04:00:: .
`` We bump '' , one said ; and the other went on to development---development%1:22:02:: of the idea---idea%1:09:00:: .
My mother---mother%1:18:00:: was beside herself with curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: .
She laughed a little and tossed the dregs---dregs%1:17:00:: rakishly around in her glass---glass%1:06:00:: .
She could see that Mr. Gorboduc---person%1:03:00:: was intrigued ; the hostess---hostess%1:18:02:: in her took over .
My uncle---uncle%1:18:00:: looked at Mr. Gorboduc---person%1:03:00:: .
He read Henry James---person%1:03:00:: and used to pretend profundity---profundity%1:09:01:: through eye-beamings---eye-beaming%1:04:00:: at people---people%1:14:00:: .
Mr. Gorboduc---person%1:03:00:: looked down .
Nick Skorich---person%1:03:00:: , the line coach---line_coach%1:18:00:: for the football---football%1:04:00:: champion---champion%1:18:01:: Philadelphia Eagles---group%1:03:00:: , was elevated today---today%1:28:00:: to head coach---coach%1:18:01:: .
Skorich---person%1:03:00:: received a three year---year%1:28:01:: contract---contract%1:10:00:: at a salary---salary%1:21:00:: believed to be between $ 20000 and $ 25000 a year---year%1:28:01:: .
He succeeds Buck Shaw---person%1:03:00:: , who retired at the end---end%1:28:00:: of last season---season%1:28:02:: .
The appointment---appointment%1:04:00:: was announced at a news conference---news_conference%1:10:00:: at which Skorich---person%1:03:00:: said he would retain two members---member%1:18:00:: of Shaw---person%1:03:00:: 's staff---staff%1:14:01:: - Jerry Williams---person%1:03:00:: and Charlie Gauer---person%1:03:00:: .
Williams---person%1:03:00:: is a defensive coach---coach%1:18:01:: .
Gauer---person%1:03:00:: works with the ends---end%1:18:00:: .
The selection---selection%1:09:00:: had been expected .
Skorich---person%1:03:00:: was considered the logical choice---choice%1:09:00:: after the club---club%1:14:01:: gave Norm Van Brocklin---person%1:03:00:: permission---permission%1:04:00:: to seek the head coaching job---coaching_job%1:04:00:: with the Minnesota Vikings---group%1:03:00:: , the newest National Football League---group%1:03:00:: entry---entry%1:10:00:: .
Van Brocklin---person%1:03:00:: , the quarterback---quarterback%1:18:00:: who led the Eagles---group%1:03:00:: to the title---title%1:26:00:: , was signed by the Vikings---group%1:03:00:: last Wednesday---wednesday%1:28:00:: .
Philadelphia---group%1:03:00:: permitted him to seek a better connection---connection%1:26:00:: after he had refused to reconsider his decision---decision%1:04:00:: to end his career---career%1:04:00:: as a player---player%1:18:01:: .
With Skorich---person%1:03:00:: at the helm---helm%1:04:00:: , the Eagles---group%1:03:00:: are expected to put more emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: on running---running%1:04:03:: , rather than passing---passing%1:04:03:: .
In the past---past%1:28:00:: the club---club%1:14:01:: depended largely on Van Brocklin---person%1:03:00:: 's aerials---aerial%1:04:00:: .
Skorich---person%1:03:00:: , however , is a strong advocate---advocate%1:18:00:: of a balanced attack---attack%1:04:04:: - split between running---running%1:04:03:: and passing---passing%1:04:03:: .
Skorich---person%1:03:00:: , who is 39 years---year%1:28:01:: old , played football---football%1:04:00:: at Cincinnati University---group%1:03:00:: and then had a three year---year%1:28:01:: professional career---career%1:04:00:: as a lineman---lineman%1:18:00:: under Jock Sutherland---person%1:03:00:: with the Pittsburgh Steelers---group%1:03:00:: .
An injury---injury%1:11:00:: forced Skorich---person%1:03:00:: to quit after the 1948 season---season%1:28:02:: .
He began his coaching---coaching%1:04:00:: career---career%1:04:00:: at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School---group%1:03:00:: in 1949 .
He remained there for four years---year%1:28:01:: before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute---group%1:03:00:: in Troy---location%1:03:00:: , N. Y.---location%1:03:00:: .
He was there one season---season%1:28:02:: before rejoining the Steelers---group%1:03:00:: as an assistant coach---coach%1:18:01:: .
Four years---year%1:28:01:: later he resigned to take a similar job---job%1:04:00:: with the Green Bay Packers---group%1:03:00:: .
The Eagles---group%1:03:00:: signed him for Shaw---person%1:03:00:: 's staff---staff%1:14:01:: in 1959 .
Skorich---person%1:03:00:: began his new job---job%1:04:00:: auspiciously today---today%1:28:01:: .
At a ceremony---ceremony%1:11:00:: in the reception room---reception_room%1:06:00:: of Mayor Richardson Dilworth---person%1:03:00:: , the Eagles---group%1:03:00:: were honored for winning the championship---championship%1:26:00:: .

The 53 - year---year%1:28:01:: old Shea---person%1:03:00:: , a prominent corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: with a sports---sport%1:04:01:: background---background%1:07:00:: , is generally recognized as the man---man%1:18:00:: most responsible for the imminent return---return%1:11:02:: of a National League---group%1:03:00:: club---club%1:14:01:: to New York---new_york%1:15:01:: .
Named by Mayor Wagner---person%1:03:00:: three years---year%1:28:01:: ago to head a committee---committee%1:14:01:: that included James A. Farley---person%1:03:00:: , Bernard Gimbel---person%1:03:00:: and Clint Blume---person%1:03:00:: , Shea---person%1:03:00:: worked relentlessly .
His goal---goal%1:09:00:: was to obtain a National League---group%1:03:00:: team---team%1:14:00:: for this city---city%1:15:00:: .
The departure---departure%1:04:00:: of the Giants---group%1:03:00:: and the Dodgers---group%1:03:00:: to California---california%1:15:00:: left New York---new_york%1:15:01:: with only the Yankees---group%1:03:00:: .
Despite countless barriers---barrier%1:09:00:: and disappointments---disappointment%1:04:00:: , Shea---person%1:03:00:: moved forward .
When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion---expansion%1:04:00:: , he sought to convince another National League---group%1:03:00:: club---club%1:14:01:: to move here .
When that failed , he enlisted Branch Rickey---person%1:03:00:: 's aid---aid%1:04:00:: in the formation---formation%1:04:01:: of a third major league---major_league%1:14:00:: , the Continental---group%1:03:00:: , with New York---new_york%1:15:01:: as the key franchise---franchise%1:10:00:: .
The Continental League---group%1:03:00:: never got off the ground , but after two years---year%1:28:01:: it forced the existing majors---majors%1:14:00:: to expand .
The New York---new_york%1:15:01:: franchise---franchise%1:10:00:: is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson---person%1:03:00:: .
A big-league---big_league%1:14:00:: municipal stadium---stadium%1:06:00:: at Flushing Meadow Park---location%1:03:00:: is in the works , and once the lease---lease%1:21:00:: is signed the local club---club%1:14:01:: will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick---person%1:03:00:: .

He was the lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: for Ted Collins---person%1:03:00:: ' old Boston Yankees---group%1:03:00:: in the National Football League---group%1:03:00:: .
All was quiet in the office---office%1:06:00:: of the Yankees---group%1:03:00:: and the local National Leaguers---person%1:03:00:: yesterday---yesterday%1:28:01:: .

The principal speaker---speaker%1:18:00:: will be Senator Stuart Symington---person%1:03:00:: , Democrat---democrat%1:18:00:: of Missouri---missouri%1:15:00:: .
Arnold Palmer---person%1:03:00:: has been a blazing figure---figure%1:18:00:: in golf---golf%1:04:00:: over the past twelve months---month%1:28:00:: .
He won the Masters , the United States Open and a record $ 80738 in prize money---prize_money%1:21:00:: .
He was heralded as `` Sportsman---sportsman%1:18:00:: of the Year---year%1:28:01:: '' by Sports Illustrated , and last night---night%1:28:00:: was acclaimed in Rochester---location%1:03:00:: as the `` Professional Athlete of the Year '' , a distinction---distinction%1:26:00:: that earned for him the $ 10000 diamond---diamond%1:21:00:: - studded Hickok Belt .
But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer---duffer%1:18:00:: who ever flubbed a shot---shot%1:04:06:: .
A couple of weeks---week%1:28:00:: ago , he scored a monstrous 12---12%1:23:00:: on a par---par%1:23:00:: 5 hole---hole%1:06:01:: .
And it also stayed the hands---hand%1:08:00:: of thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of brooding incompetents---incompetent%1:18:00:: who were meditating the abandonment---abandonment%1:04:03:: of a sport---sport%1:04:01:: whose frustrations---frustration%1:12:00:: were driving them to despair .
If such a paragon---paragon%1:09:00:: of perfection---perfection%1:26:00:: as Palmer---person%1:03:00:: could commit such a scoring sacrilege---sacrilege%1:04:00:: , there was hope---hope%1:09:00:: left for all .
It was neither a spirit---spirit%1:07:03:: of self-sacrifice---self-sacrifice%1:04:00:: nor a yen---yen%1:12:00:: to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold---person%1:03:00:: .
He merely became victimized by a form---form%1:09:01:: of athletics---athletics%1:04:00:: that respects no one and aggravates all .
The world 's best golfer---golfer%1:18:00:: , shooting below par---par%1:23:00:: , came to the last hole---hole%1:06:01:: of the opening round---round%1:04:03:: of the Los Angeles open with every intention---intention%1:09:00:: of delivering a final crusher---crusher%1:06:00:: .
He boomed a 280 - yard---yard%1:23:00:: drive---drive%1:04:03:: .
Then the pixies---pixie%1:18:00:: and the zombies---zombie%1:18:00:: took over while the banshees---banshee%1:18:00:: wailed in the distance---distance%1:07:00:: .
On the narrow fairway---fairway%1:15:00:: of a 508 - yard---yard%1:23:00:: hole---hole%1:06:01:: , Arnold---person%1:03:00:: whipped into his second shot---shot%1:04:06:: .
The ball---ball%1:06:01:: went off in a majestic arc---arc%1:25:00:: , an out-of-bounds slice---slice%1:04:00:: .
He hooked the next two---two%1:23:00:: out of bounds on the opposite side---side%1:15:02:: .
Each of the four wayward shots---shot%1:04:06:: cost him two strokes---stroke%1:04:00:: .
So he wound up with a dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: .
`` It was a nice round figure---figure%1:23:00:: , that 12 '' , he said as he headed for the clubhouse---clubhouse%1:06:00:: , not too much perturbed .
From the standpoint---standpoint%1:09:00:: of the army---army%1:14:01:: of duffers---duffer%1:18:00:: , however , this was easily the most heartening exhibition---exhibition%1:04:00:: they had had since Ben Hogan---person%1:03:00:: fell upon evil ways---way%1:04:00:: during his heyday---heyday%1:28:00:: and scored an 11---11%1:23:00:: in the Texas open .
The idol---idol%1:18:00:: of the hackers---hacker%1:18:02:: , of course , is Ray Ainsley---person%1:03:00:: , who achieved a 19---19%1:23:00:: in the United States Open .
Their secondary hero---hero%1:18:00:: is another pro---pro%1:18:00:: , Willie Chisholm---person%1:03:00:: , who drank his lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: during another Open and tried to blast his way---way%1:15:00:: out of a rock---rock%1:27:00:: strewn gully---gully%1:17:00:: .
Willie---person%1:03:00:: 's partner---partner%1:18:00:: was Long Jim Barnes---person%1:03:00:: , who tried to keep count---count%1:04:00:: .
`` How many is that , Jim---person%1:03:00:: '' ? asked Willie---person%1:03:00:: at one stage---stage%1:28:00:: of his excavation---excavation%1:04:01:: project---project%1:04:00:: .
`` Thirteen---thirteen%1:23:00:: '' , said Long Jim---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Nae , man '' , said Willie---person%1:03:00:: , `` ye must be countin ' the echoes---echo%1:07:00:: '' .
He had a 16---16%1:23:00:: .
Palmer---person%1:03:00:: 's dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: were honestly earned .
Nor were there any rules---rule%1:09:00:: to save him .
If there had been , he would have found a loophole---loophole%1:10:00:: , because Arnold---person%1:03:00:: is one golfer---golfer%1:18:00:: who knows the code---code%1:10:01:: as thoroughly as the man---man%1:18:00:: who wrote the book---book%1:10:00:: .
This knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: has come in handy , too .
His first shot---shot%1:04:06:: in the Open last year---year%1:28:01:: landed in a brook---brook%1:17:00:: that flowed along the right side---side%1:15:02:: of the fairway---fairway%1:15:00:: .
The ball---ball%1:06:01:: floated downstream .
A spectator---spectator%1:18:00:: picked up the ball---ball%1:06:01:: and handed it to a small boy---boy%1:18:00:: , who dropped this suddenly hot potato---hot_potato%1:26:00:: in a very playable lie---lie%1:10:00:: .
Arnold---person%1:03:00:: sent for Joe Dey---person%1:03:00:: , the executive secretary---executive_secretary%1:18:00:: of the golf---golf%1:04:00:: association---association%1:14:00:: .
Joe---person%1:03:00:: naturally ruled that a ball---ball%1:06:01:: be dropped from alongside the spot---spot%1:15:01:: where it had originally entered the stream---stream%1:17:00:: .
`` I knew it all along '' , confessed Arnold---person%1:03:00:: with a grin---grin%1:10:00:: , `` but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there '' .
For a serious young man---young_man%1:18:01:: who plays golf---golf%1:04:00:: with a serious intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: , Palmer---person%1:03:00:: has such an inherent sense of humor---sense_of_humor%1:07:00:: that it relieves the strain---strain%1:26:01:: and keeps his nerves---nerves%1:26:00:: from jangling like banjo---banjo%1:06:00:: strings---string%1:06:03:: .
Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors---competitor%1:18:00:: .
He 'll even bull head-on into the rules---rule%1:09:00:: when he is sure he 's right .
It happened on the twelfth hole---hole%1:06:01:: , a 155 - yarder .
Arnold---person%1:03:00:: 's iron---iron%1:06:01:: shot---shot%1:04:06:: from the tee---tee%1:15:00:: burrowed into the bunker---bunker%1:06:00:: guarding the green---green%1:15:01:: , an embankment---embankment%1:06:00:: that had become soft and spongy from the rains---rain%1:19:00:: , thereby bringing local rules---rule%1:09:00:: into force---force%1:07:01:: .
`` I can remove the ball---ball%1:06:01:: , can't I '' ? asked Palmer---person%1:03:00:: of an official---official%1:18:00:: .
`` No---no%1:10:00:: '' , said the official---official%1:18:00:: .
`` You 're wrong '' , said Arnold---person%1:03:00:: , a man---man%1:18:00:: who knows the rules---rule%1:09:00:: .
`` I 'll do as you say , but I 'll also play a provisional ball---ball%1:06:01:: and get a ruling---ruling%1:04:00:: '' .
He scored a 4---4%1:23:00:: for the embedded ball---ball%1:06:01:: , a 3---3%1:23:00:: with the provisional one .
The golfing---golfing%1:04:00:: fathers---father%1:18:05:: ruled in his favor---favor%1:07:00:: .
So he picked up a stroke---stroke%1:04:00:: with the provisional ball---ball%1:06:01:: and won the tournament---tournament%1:11:00:: by the margin---margin%1:07:00:: of that stroke---stroke%1:04:00:: .
Until a few weeks---week%1:28:00:: ago , however , Arnold Palmer---person%1:03:00:: was some god-like creature---creature%1:03:00:: who had nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: in common with the duffers---duffer%1:18:00:: .
But after that 12---12%1:23:00:: at Los Angeles---los_angeles%1:15:00:: he became one of the boys , a bigger hero---hero%1:18:00:: than he ever had been before .
A formula---formula%1:10:02:: to supply players---player%1:18:01:: for the new Minneapolis Vikings---group%1:03:00:: and the problem---problem%1:10:00:: of increasing the 1961 schedule---schedule%1:10:00:: to fourteen games---game%1:04:00:: will be discussed by National Football League---group%1:03:00:: owners---owner%1:18:00:: at a meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: at the Hotel Warwick---group%1:03:00:: today---today%1:28:01:: .
Other items---item%1:06:00:: on the agenda---agenda%1:09:00:: during the meetings---meeting%1:14:00:: , which are expected to continue through Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: , concern television---television%1:10:00:: , rules---rule%1:09:00:: changes---change%1:11:00:: , professional football---football%1:04:00:: 's hall of fame---hall_of_fame%1:06:00:: , players---player%1:18:01:: ' benefits---benefit%1:21:00:: and constitutional amendments---amendment%1:04:00:: .
The owners---owner%1:18:00:: would like each club---club%1:14:01:: in the fourteen team---team%1:14:00:: league---league%1:14:01:: to play a home and home series---series%1:11:00:: with teams---team%1:14:00:: in its division---division%1:14:03:: , plus two games---game%1:04:00:: against teams---team%1:14:00:: in the other division---division%1:14:03:: .
However , this would require a lengthening---lengthening%1:04:00:: of the season---season%1:28:02:: from thirteen to fourteen weeks---week%1:28:00:: .
Pete Rozelle---person%1:03:00:: , the league---league%1:14:01:: commissioner---commissioner%1:18:00:: , pointed out :
`` We 'll have the problem---problem%1:10:00:: of baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: at one end---end%1:15:00:: and weather---weather%1:19:00:: at the other '' .
Nine---nine%1:23:00:: of the league---league%1:14:01:: 's teams---team%1:14:00:: play in baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: parks---park%1:06:00:: and therefore face an early season---season%1:28:02:: conflict---conflict%1:07:00:: in dates---date%1:28:00:: .
She was carrying a quirt---quirt%1:06:00:: , and she started to raise it , then let it fall again and dangle from her wrist---wrist%1:08:00:: .
`` I saw your fire---fire%1:11:00:: '' , she said , speaking slowly , making an effort---effort%1:04:00:: to control her anger---anger%1:12:00:: .
`` You could burn down this whole mountainside---mountainside%1:17:00:: with a fire---fire%1:11:00:: that size---size%1:07:00:: .
It would n't matter to a fool---fool%1:18:00:: like you .
`` All right '' , Wilson---person%1:03:00:: said quickly .
`` The fire---fire%1:11:00:: 's too big .
And I appreciate the advice---advice%1:10:00:: '' .
He was losing patience---patience%1:07:00:: again .
An hour---hour%1:28:00:: before , with the children---child%1:18:00:: asleep and nothing but the strange darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: , he would have appreciated company---company%1:18:00:: .
She had helped him change his mind---mind%1:09:04:: .
That fire---fire%1:11:00:: 's too big .
And make sure it 's out when you leave in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: '' .
It took him a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: to compose himself .
`` There 's some mistake---mistake%1:09:00:: '' , he said finally .
`` You 're right about the fire---fire%1:11:00:: .
It 's bigger than it has to be , though I do n't see where it 's doing any harm---harm%1:04:00:: .
But you 're wrong about the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of it .
I'm not leaving in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
I own the place---place%1:15:04:: '' .
She showed her surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: by tightening the reins---rein%1:06:00:: and moving the gelding---gelding%1:05:00:: around so that she could get a better look---look%1:04:00:: at his face---face%1:08:00:: .
She glanced around the clearing---clearing%1:15:00:: , taking in the wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: and the load---load%1:06:02:: of supplies and trappings---trapping%1:06:01:: scattered over the ground---ground%1:17:00:: , the two kids---kid%1:18:00:: , the whiteface---whiteface%1:05:00:: bull---bull%1:05:01:: that was chewing its cud---cud%1:13:01:: just within the far reaches---reach%1:15:00:: of the firelight---firelight%1:19:00:: .
She studied it for a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: .
Then she turned back to Wilson---person%1:03:00:: and smiled , and he was n't quite sure what she meant by it .
`` You own this place---place%1:15:04:: '' ? she said , and her tone---tone%1:10:01:: had softened until it was almost friendly .
`` From a man---man%1:18:00:: in St. Louis---st._louis%1:15:00:: '' , Wilson---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Jake Carwood---person%1:03:00:: .
The girl---girl%1:18:00:: laughed .
My father---father%1:18:00:: ran him off here six years---year%1:28:01:: ago '' .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: did n't say anything .
He stood watching the girl---girl%1:18:00:: , wondering what was coming next .
She had picked up the quirt---quirt%1:06:00:: and was twirling it around her wrist---wrist%1:08:00:: and smiling at him .
`` Carwood---person%1:03:00:: did n't tell you that '' , she said .
`` No '' , Wilson---person%1:03:00:: said .
It 's not the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of thing---thing%1:26:00:: that a man---man%1:18:00:: would be proud of .
And it does n't make any difference---difference%1:07:00:: .
He sold me a clear title---title%1:10:04:: .
`` It would n't matter to my father---father%1:18:00:: , and not to me .
I meant what I said about that fire---fire%1:11:00:: .
I 'll let you go back to doing the dishes---dish%1:06:00:: now '' .
He took the reins---rein%1:06:00:: just below the bit---bit%1:06:01:: and held them firmly , and it was his turn---turn%1:04:06:: to smile now .
`` I do n't mind washing dishes---dish%1:06:00:: now and then '' , he said pleasantly .
Somebody might mistake you for a woman---woman%1:18:00:: '' .
He meant to say more , but he never got the chance---chance%1:26:00:: .
She brought the quirt---quirt%1:06:00:: down , slashing it across his cheek---cheek%1:08:00:: , and he tried to step back .
She swung the quirt---quirt%1:06:00:: again , and this time---time%1:11:00:: he caught her wrist---wrist%1:08:00:: and pulled her out of the saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: .
She came down against him , and he tried to break her fall---fall%1:04:01:: .
He grabbed her by the shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: and went down on one knee---knee%1:08:00:: , taking her weight---weight%1:07:00:: so that some of the wind---wind%1:04:01:: was driven out of him .
He wiped the blood---blood%1:08:00:: from his cheek---cheek%1:08:00:: .
He was shaking with anger---anger%1:12:00:: , his breath---breath%1:27:00:: coming in long , painful gasps---gasp%1:04:00:: .
`` That quirt---quirt%1:06:00:: - I ought to use it on you , where it would do the most good---good%1:07:02:: .
If you were a man---man%1:18:00:: '' -
The voice---voice%1:10:00:: came from behind him , and Wilson---person%1:03:00:: turned .
The fire---fire%1:11:00:: had gone down , and the man---man%1:18:00:: was only a shadow---shadow%1:26:01:: against the trees---tree%1:20:00:: .
But a moment---moment%1:28:01:: later he brought his horse---horse%1:05:00:: forward into the light---light%1:15:00:: , and Wilson---person%1:03:00:: had a good look---look%1:04:00:: at him .
He was tall and dark-skinned , a half-breed---half-breed%1:18:00:: , Wilson---person%1:03:00:: thought .
And he was handsome , despite the long thin scar---scar%1:26:00:: that slanted across his cheek---cheek%1:08:00:: .
`` She 's not a man---man%1:18:00:: , mister '' , he said .
If you 've got any ideas---idea%1:09:00:: '' .
He raised the Winchester and pointed it at Wilson---person%1:03:00:: 's chest---chest%1:08:00:: .
`` Put the rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: down , Joseph---person%1:03:00:: '' , the girl---girl%1:18:00:: said .
The half-breed---half-breed%1:18:00:: eased the Winchester down and rested it across his lap---lap%1:08:00:: .
The scar---scar%1:26:00:: looked pure white---white%1:07:00:: in the half---half%1:23:00:: darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: ; his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: were black and deep-set , and expressionless .
`` You should n't be riding up here after dark---dark%1:28:00:: , Judith---person%1:03:00:: '' , he said quietly .
It 's no job---job%1:04:01:: for you '' .
The girl---girl%1:18:00:: tapped the quirt---quirt%1:06:00:: impatiently against her knee---knee%1:08:00:: and glared at him .
`` I said go home , Joseph---person%1:03:00:: .
You 've got no business---business%1:09:01:: up here '' .
The half-breed---half-breed%1:18:00:: did n't answer this time---time%1:11:00:: .
But the scar---scar%1:26:00:: seemed to pull hard at the corner---corner%1:25:00:: of his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: , and his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: were hurt and angry .
It made Wilson---person%1:03:00:: wonder .
He watched the half-breed---half-breed%1:18:00:: as he turned silently .
They could hear the pony---pony%1:05:02:: 's feet---foot%1:05:01:: on the dry leaves---leaf%1:20:00:: for a while , then the sound---sound%1:07:00:: faded out .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: brushed the dust---dust%1:27:00:: from his coat---coat%1:06:00:: .
`` Your personal guard---guard%1:18:03:: ?
`` He works for my father---father%1:18:00:: '' , the girl---girl%1:18:00:: said , and then seemed to change her mind---mind%1:09:04:: .
`` He 's a friend---friend%1:18:00:: .
His name---name%1:10:00:: 's Joseph Sanchez---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Not now '' , Wilson---person%1:03:00:: said .
You 've got blood---blood%1:08:00:: on your cheek---cheek%1:08:00:: .
She wiped it off with the sleeve---sleeve%1:06:00:: of her coat---coat%1:06:00:: .
`` I 'll bet that 's as close as you 've been to a man---man%1:18:00:: since you were a baby---baby%1:18:00:: '' , Wilson---person%1:03:00:: said .
He saw her hand---hand%1:08:00:: start to work down the leather---leather%1:27:00:: thong---thong%1:06:00:: toward the handle---handle%1:06:00:: of the quirt---quirt%1:06:00:: , and he grabbed her wrist---wrist%1:08:00:: .
`` Oh , no '' , he said , and he was without humor---humor%1:07:01:: now .
`` I 've had enough---enough%1:23:00:: of that .
I 've had enough---enough%1:23:00:: of you .
I do n't know what makes you think you can get away with this kind of business---business%1:04:01:: , and I do n't care about that , either .
You took me by surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: .
But I 'll know how to handle you next time---time%1:11:00:: '' .
She brought up her free hand---hand%1:08:00:: to hit him , but this time---time%1:11:00:: he was quicker .
He side-stepped her blow---blow%1:04:01:: and she fell , stumbling against the gelding---gelding%1:05:00:: .
She finally regained her balance---balance%1:26:00:: and got up in the saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: .
Her hat---hat%1:06:00:: had come off and fallen behind her shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: , held by the string---string%1:06:01:: , and he could see her face---face%1:08:00:: more clearly than he had at any time---time%1:11:00:: before .
But her prettiness---prettiness%1:07:00:: was what he had noticed first , and all the other things---thing%1:07:00:: had come afterward :
cruelty---cruelty%1:04:00:: , meanness---meanness%1:07:00:: , self-will---self-will%1:07:00:: .
He had known women---woman%1:18:00:: like that , one woman---woman%1:18:00:: in particular .
And one---one%1:23:00:: had been too many .
He watched the girl---girl%1:18:00:: until she had gone into the trees---tree%1:20:00:: , and waited until he could n't hear the sound---sound%1:09:00:: of her horse---horse%1:05:00:: any longer , then went up to where the children---child%1:18:00:: were sleeping .
They were n't sleeping , of course , but they thought they were doing him a favor---favor%1:04:00:: by pretending .
He had n't shown up too well in their eyes---eyes%1:09:00:: , letting himself be browbeaten by a woman---woman%1:18:00:: .
They expected greater things---thing%1:04:00:: from him , regardless of how trying the circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: , and they were disappointed .
They lay a little too stiffly , with their eyes---eye%1:08:00:: straining to stay closed .
There 's better things---thing%1:04:00:: to do than listen to something like that .
I 'll be down at the creek---creek%1:17:00:: finishing the dishes---dish%1:06:00:: , if you want me '' .
He found the pan---pan%1:06:01:: where he had dropped it and carried it back down to the stream---stream%1:17:00:: .
The coyote---coyote%1:05:00:: was calling again , and he hoped that this time---time%1:11:00:: there would be no other sounds---sound%1:11:00:: to interrupt it .
He had a feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: that the girl---girl%1:18:00:: meant trouble .
If she did , he could stand it better in the light---light%1:15:00:: .
He scrubbed absent-mindedly at the pans---pan%1:06:01:: and reflected on how things---thing%1:26:00:: had turned out .
That afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: when they had pulled up in front of the broken-down ranch house---ranch_house%1:06:00:: , his hopes---hope%1:12:01:: had been high .
Already some of the pain---pain%1:12:00:: had gone from Amelia---person%1:03:00:: 's death---death%1:11:00:: .
There would still be plenty of moments---moment%1:28:00:: of regret---regret%1:12:00:: and sadness---sadness%1:12:00:: and guilty relief---relief%1:26:00:: .
But they were starting a new life---life%1:26:02:: .
And they had almost everything they needed : land---land%1:21:01:: , a house---house%1:06:00:: , two whiteface---whiteface%1:05:00:: bulls---bull%1:05:01:: , three horses---horse%1:05:00:: .
The land---land%1:21:01:: was n't all Wilson---person%1:03:00:: had expected of it .
Six hundred and forty acres---acres%1:21:00:: , the old man---old_man%1:18:02:: back in St. Louis---st._louis%1:15:00:: had said ; good grass---grass%1:20:00:: , good water---water%1:27:00:: .
Well , the grass---grass%1:20:00:: was there , though in some places---place%1:15:00:: the ground---ground%1:17:00:: was too steep for a cow---cow%1:05:01:: to get to it .
The water---water%1:27:00:: was there , so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard---orchard%1:06:00:: .
And there was a house---house%1:06:00:: ; livable perhaps , but badly in need of repairs---repair%1:04:00:: .
In the last analysis , though , Wilson---person%1:03:00:: had little cause---cause%1:10:00:: to complain .
The place---place%1:15:04:: had been cheap - just the little---little%1:23:00:: he had left after Amelia---person%1:03:00:: 's burial---burial%1:11:00:: - and it would serve its purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: .
There was only one place---place%1:10:00:: where Jake Carwood---person%1:03:00:: 's description---description%1:10:01:: had gone badly awry : the peace---peace%1:26:02:: and quiet---quiet%1:26:02:: .
It had n't started out that way---way%1:26:00:: .
And he had a feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: - thanks---thanks%1:04:00:: to the girl---girl%1:18:00:: - that things---thing%1:26:00:: would get worse before they got better .
They had the house---house%1:06:00:: cleaned up by noon---noon%1:28:00:: , and Wilson---person%1:03:00:: sent the boy---boy%1:18:00:: out to the meadow---meadow%1:15:00:: to bring in the horses---horse%1:05:00:: .
He stood on the porch---porch%1:06:00:: and watched him struggling with the heavy harness---harness%1:06:00:: , and finally went over to help him .
Kathy---person%1:03:00:: was already in the wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: .
They were going to town---town%1:15:00:: , and they were both excited .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: backed the team---team%1:14:01:: into the traces---trace%1:06:01:: , and wished they were n't going to town---town%1:15:00:: at all .
He had an uneasy feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: about it .
That girl---girl%1:18:00:: last night---night%1:28:01:: , what was her name---name%1:10:00:: ?
Judith Pierce---person%1:03:00:: .
It was the only thing---thing%1:07:00:: about her that was the least bit hard to remember .
He finished with the team---team%1:14:01:: and filled his pipe---pipe%1:06:01:: and stood looking about him .
He had spent two hours---hour%1:28:00:: riding around the ranch---ranch%1:06:00:: that morning---morning%1:28:00:: , and in broad daylight---daylight%1:19:00:: it was even less inviting than Judith Pierce---person%1:03:00:: had made it seem .
There was brush---brush%1:14:00:: , and stands---stand%1:14:00:: of pine---pine%1:20:00:: that no grass---grass%1:20:00:: could grow under , and places---place%1:15:00:: so steep that cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: would n't stop to graze .
But there was water---water%1:27:00:: .
There was an artificial lake---artificial_lake%1:06:00:: just out of sight in the first stand---stand%1:14:00:: of trees---tree%1:20:00:: , fed by a half---half%1:23:00:: dozen---dozen%1:23:00:: springs---spring%1:17:00:: that popped out of the ground---ground%1:17:00:: above the hillside---hillside%1:17:00:: orchard---orchard%1:06:00:: .
Yes , there was plenty of water---water%1:27:00:: , too much , and that was probably the trouble .
There were tracks---track%1:17:00:: of cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: all over his six hundred and forty acres---acres%1:21:00:: .
The first part---part%1:06:00:: of the road---road%1:06:00:: was steep , but it leveled off after the second bend---bend%1:06:00:: and curled gradually into the valley---valley%1:17:00:: .
It was hotter once they reached the flat---flat%1:17:00:: , and drier , but the grass---grass%1:20:00:: was better .
A warm breeze---breeze%1:19:00:: played across it , moving it like waves---wave%1:11:01:: .
A red-tailed hawk---red-tailed_hawk%1:05:00:: flew in behind them and stayed there , watching for any snakes---snake%1:05:00:: or rabbits---rabbit%1:05:00:: that they might stir up from the side---side%1:15:02:: of the road---road%1:06:00:: .
It took them an hour---hour%1:28:00:: before they came to the first houses---house%1:06:00:: of Kelseyville---location%1:03:00:: .
The town---town%1:15:00:: was about what Wilson---person%1:03:00:: expected : one main street---main_street%1:06:00:: with its rows---row%1:14:00:: of false-fronted buildings---building%1:06:00:: , a water tower---water_tower%1:06:00:: , a few warehouses---warehouse%1:06:00:: , a single hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: ; all dusty and sunbaked .
The place---place%1:15:01:: was quiet .
With a sneer---sneer%1:10:00:: , the man---man%1:18:00:: spread his legs---leg%1:08:01:: and , a third time---time%1:11:00:: , confronted them .
For a moment---moment%1:28:01:: , boy---boy%1:18:00:: and mount---mount%1:05:00:: hung in midair---midair%1:15:00:: .
Stevie---person%1:03:00:: twisted and , frantically , commanded the mare---mare%1:05:00:: to leap straight ahead .
But the stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: was nimbler still .
With a bold arm---arm%1:08:00:: , he dared once more to obstruct them .
Katie reared a third time---time%1:11:00:: , then , trembling , descended .
The stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: leered .
Seizing the bridle---bridle%1:06:00:: , he tugged with all his might---might%1:07:00:: and forced Katie to her knees---knee%1:05:01:: .
Stevie---person%1:03:00:: could feel himself toppling .
He saw the ground---ground%1:27:00:: coming up - and the stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: .
With incredible ferocity---ferocity%1:07:00:: , he brought his fists---fist%1:08:00:: together and struck .
The blow---blow%1:04:01:: encountered silky hair---hair%1:08:00:: and hard bone---bone%1:08:00:: .
The man---man%1:18:00:: uttered a weird cry---cry%1:10:00:: , spun about , and collapsed in the sand---sand%1:27:00:: .
Katie scrambled to her feet---foot%1:05:01:: , Stevie---person%1:03:00:: agilely retaining his seat---seat%1:06:00:: .
Again Katie reared , and now , wickedly , he compelled her to bring her hooves---hoof%1:05:00:: down again and again upon the sprawled figure---figure%1:08:00:: of the stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: .
He could feel his own feet---foot%1:08:01:: , iron-shod , striking repeatedly until the body---body%1:08:00:: was limp .
He gloated , and his lips---lip%1:08:00:: slavered .
They rode around and around to trample the figure---figure%1:08:00:: into the sand---sand%1:27:00:: .
Only the top---top%1:15:01:: of the head---head%1:08:00:: , with a spot---spot%1:07:01:: bare and white as a clamshell---clamshell%1:05:00:: , remained visible .
Stevie---person%1:03:00:: was shouting triumphantly .
A train---train%1:06:00:: hooted .
He was frightened ; his fists---fist%1:08:00:: clutched so tightly that his knuckles---knuckle%1:08:00:: hurt .
`` Stevie---person%1:03:00:: !
Stevie---person%1:03:00:: '' !
His mother---mother%1:18:00:: was nudging him , but he was still falling .
His head---head%1:08:00:: hung over the boards---board%1:06:00:: of Katie 's stall---stall%1:06:00:: ; before it was sprawled the mangled corpse---corpse%1:08:00:: of the bearded stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: .
`` Stevie---location%1:03:00:: , wake up now !
He was safe in his Mama---mama%1:18:00:: 's arms---arm%1:08:00:: .
The train---train%1:06:00:: had slowed .
Houses---house%1:06:00:: winked as the cars---car%1:06:01:: rolled beside a little depot---depot%1:06:00:: .
`` Po ' Chavis---location%1:03:00:: '' ! the trainman---trainman%1:18:00:: called .
He came by and repeated , `` Po ' Chavis---location%1:03:00:: '' !
The room---room%1:06:00:: vibrated as if a giant hand---hand%1:08:00:: had rocked it .
a dull boom---boom%1:11:01:: and a throbbing echo---echo%1:07:00:: .
The walls---wall%1:06:00:: bulged , the floor---floor%1:06:00:: trembled , the windowpanes---windowpane%1:06:00:: rattled .
He stared at the far morning---morning%1:28:00:: , expecting a pendulum---pendulum%1:06:00:: to swing across the horizon---horizon%1:15:00:: .
He raced to the window---window%1:06:00:: and yanked at the sash---sash%1:06:00:: .
the wood---wood%1:27:00:: was old , the paint---paint%1:06:00:: alligatored .
A fresh breeze---breeze%1:19:00:: saluted him .
He put his his head---head%1:08:00:: out .
There was the slate roof---slate_roof%1:06:00:: of the church---church%1:06:00:: ; ivy---ivy%1:20:00:: climbed the red brick---brick%1:06:00:: walls---wall%1:06:00:: like a green scaled monster---monster%1:18:03:: .
The clock---clock%1:06:00:: which had struck presented an innocent face---face%1:07:00:: .
In the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: Mama---mama%1:18:00:: was wiping the cupboards---cupboard%1:06:00:: .
`` There 's a tower---tower%1:06:00:: and a steeple---steeple%1:06:00:: on the church---church%1:06:00:: a million feet---foot%1:23:00:: high .
And the loudest clock---clock%1:06:00:: in the whole world---world%1:17:01:: '' !
`` I know , Stephen---person%1:03:00:: '' , she smiled .
`` They say that our steeple---steeple%1:06:00:: is one hundred and sixty-two feet---foot%1:23:00:: high .
The clock---clock%1:06:00:: you heard strike - it 's really the town---town%1:15:00:: clock---clock%1:06:00:: - was installed last April---april%1:28:00:: by Mrs. Shorter---person%1:03:00:: , on her birthday---birthday%1:28:00:: '' .
He crossed Broome Street---location%1:03:00:: to Orange Square---location%1:03:00:: .
The steeple---steeple%1:06:00:: leaned backward , while the church---church%1:06:00:: advanced like a headless creature---creature%1:03:00:: in a long , shapeless coat---coat%1:06:00:: .
The spire---spire%1:06:00:: seemed to hold up the sky---sky%1:17:00:: .
Port Jervis---location%1:03:00:: , basking in the foothills , was the city of God .
The Dutch Reformed Church---group%1:03:00:: , with two steeples---steeple%1:06:00:: and its own school---school%1:14:00:: was on Main Street---location%1:03:00:: ; the Episcopal Church---group%1:03:00:: was one block---block%1:15:00:: down Sussex Street---location%1:03:00:: ; the Catholic Saint Mary's Church---group%1:03:00:: , with an even taller steeple---steeple%1:06:00:: and a cross---cross%1:06:00:: on top---top%1:15:01:: , stood on Ball Street---location%1:03:00:: .
The Catholics---catholic%1:18:00:: had the largest cemetery---cemetery%1:15:00:: , near the Neversink River---location%1:03:00:: where Main Street---location%1:03:00:: ran south ; Stevie---person%1:03:00:: whistled when he passed these alien grounds---grounds%1:15:00:: .
The Catholics had the largest cemetery , near the Neversink River where Main Street ran south ; Stevie whistled when he passed these alien grounds---grounds%1:06:00:: .
God---god%1:18:00:: was everywhere , in the belfry---belfry%1:06:01:: , in the steeple---steeple%1:06:00:: , in the clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: , in the trees---tree%1:20:00:: , and in the mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: hulking on the horizon---horizon%1:15:00:: .
Somewhere , beyond , where shadows---shadow%1:09:00:: lurked , must be the yawning pit---pit%1:17:00:: of which Papa---papa%1:18:00:: preached and the dreadful Lake of Fire---location%1:03:00:: .
So , walking in awe---awe%1:12:02:: , he became familiar with God---god%1:18:00:: , who resided chiefly in Drew Centennial Church---group%1:03:00:: with its high steeple---steeple%1:06:00:: and clock---clock%1:06:00:: .
There was no church---church%1:06:00:: like Drew Church---group%1:03:00:: , no preacher---preacher%1:18:00:: like Papa---papa%1:18:00:: , who was intimate with Him , and could consign sinners---sinner%1:18:00:: to hellfire .
To know God---god%1:18:00:: he must follow in Papa---papa%1:18:00:: 's footsteps---footstep%1:23:00:: .
The veterans---veteran%1:18:00:: , idling on their benches---bench%1:06:00:: in the Square---location%1:03:00:: , beneath the soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: ' monument---monument%1:06:00:: , got to their feet when Papa---papa%1:18:00:: approached : `` Morning---morning%1:10:00:: , Reverend---person%1:03:00:: '' !
His being---being%1:26:00:: and His will---will%1:09:00:: - Stevie---person%1:03:00:: could not divide God---god%1:18:00:: from his Papa---papa%1:18:00:: - illumined every parish---parish%1:14:00:: face---face%1:08:00:: , turned the choir---choir%1:14:00:: into a band---band%1:14:01:: of angels---angel%1:18:00:: , and the pulpit---pulpit%1:06:00:: into the tollgate---tollgate%1:06:00:: to Heaven .
`` We have nine hundred and eleven members---member%1:18:00:: in our charge---charge%1:04:00:: '' , Mama---mama%1:18:00:: announced , `` and three hundred and eighty Sunday-school---sunday_school%1:14:00:: scholars---scholar%1:18:01:: '' .
When Papa---papa%1:18:00:: went out to do God---god%1:18:00:: 's work---work%1:04:00:: , Stevie---person%1:03:00:: often accompanied him in the buggy---buggy%1:06:00:: , which was drawn by Violet , the new black mare---mare%1:05:00:: .
Although they journeyed westerly as far as Germantown---location%1:03:00:: , beyond the Erie---location%1:03:00:: roundhouse---roundhouse%1:06:00:: and the machine shop---machine_shop%1:06:00:: , and along the Delaware---location%1:03:00:: and Hudson Canal---location%1:03:00:: , and northward to Brooklyn---brooklyn%1:15:00:: , below Point Peter---location%1:03:00:: , he could see the church---church%1:06:00:: spire---spire%1:06:00:: wherever he looked back .
Sometimes they went south---south%1:24:00:: and rolled past the tollhouse---tollhouse%1:06:00:: - `` Afternoon---afternoon%1:10:00:: , Reverend---person%1:03:00:: '' !
- and crossed the suspension bridge---suspension_bridge%1:06:00:: to Matamoras---location%1:03:00:: ; that was Pennsylvania---pennsylvania%1:15:00:: .
In the Delaware River---delaware_river%1:17:00:: , three long islands---island%1:17:00:: were overgrown with greening trees---tree%1:20:00:: and underbrush---underbrush%1:14:00:: .
South---south%1:24:00:: of Laurel Grove Cemetery---location%1:03:00:: , and below the junction of the Neversink---location%1:03:00:: and the Delaware---delaware%1:17:00:: , was the Tri-State Rock---location%1:03:00:: , from which Stevie---person%1:03:00:: could spy New Jersey---new_jersey%1:15:00:: and Pennsylvania---pennsylvania%1:15:00:: , as well as New York---new_york%1:15:00:: , simply by spinning around on his heel---heel%1:08:00:: .
On these excursions---excursion%1:04:00:: , Papa---papa%1:18:00:: instructed him on man 's chief end---end%1:09:02:: , which was his duty---duty%1:04:00:: to God---god%1:18:00:: and his own salvation---salvation%1:04:00:: .
However , a boy---boy%1:18:00:: 's lively eyes---eye%1:08:00:: might rove .
Where Cuddleback Brook---location%1:03:00:: purled into the Neversink---location%1:03:00:: was a magnificent swimming hole---swimming_hole%1:17:00:: .
Papa---papa%1:18:00:: pointed a scornful finger---finger%1:08:00:: at the splashing youth---youth%1:18:00:: : `` Idle recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: '' !
Stevie---person%1:03:00:: saw no idols---idol%1:06:00:: ; it troubled him that he could n't always see what Papa---papa%1:18:00:: saw .
He was torn between the excitement---excitement%1:12:00:: in the sun---sun%1:19:00:: inflamed waters---water%1:17:00:: and a little engine---engine%1:06:01:: chugging northward on the Monticello Branch---location%1:03:00:: .
`` Where you been today---today%1:28:01:: '' ?
Ludie---person%1:03:00:: inquired every evening---evening%1:28:00:: , pretending that he did not care .
`` He'll make a preacher---preacher%1:18:00:: out of you '' !
`` No---no%1:10:00:: , he won't '' !
Stevie---person%1:03:00:: flared .
`` Somebody 's got to be a preacher---preacher%1:18:00:: in the family---family%1:14:00:: .
He made a will---will%1:10:00:: and last testament---testament%1:10:00:: before we left Paterson---location%1:03:00:: .
Uncle and Aunt Howe---person%1:03:00:: were the witnesses---witness%1:18:02:: '' .
Ludie---person%1:03:00:: could be hateful .
To speak of Papa---papa%1:18:00:: dying was a sin---sin%1:04:00:: .
It could never happen as long as God---god%1:18:00:: was alert and the Drew---group%1:03:00:: steeple---steeple%1:06:00:: stood guard with its peaked lance---lance%1:06:00:: .
Stevie---person%1:03:00:: was constantly slipping into the church---church%1:06:00:: .
He pulled with all his strength---strength%1:07:06:: at the heavy , brass---brass%1:27:00:: bound door---door%1:06:00:: , and shuffled along the wainscoted wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
The cold , mysterious presence---presence%1:26:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: was all around him .
At the end---end%1:15:00:: of a shaft of light---shaft_of_light%1:19:00:: , the pews---pew%1:06:00:: appeared to be broad stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: in a long dungeon---dungeon%1:06:00:: .
Far away , standing before a curtained window---window%1:06:00:: in the study---study%1:06:00:: room---room%1:06:00:: , was his father---father%1:18:00:: , hands---hand%1:08:00:: tucked under his coattails---coattail%1:06:00:: , and staring into the dark church---church%1:06:00:: .
The figure---figure%1:08:00:: was wreathed in an extraordinary luminescence---luminescence%1:19:00:: .
The boy---boy%1:18:00:: shuddered at the deathly pale countenance---countenance%1:07:00:: with its wrinkles---wrinkle%1:25:00:: and gray hair---hair%1:08:00:: .
Would Papa---papa%1:18:00:: really die ?
The mouth---mouth%1:08:00:: was thin lipped and wide , the long cleft---cleft%1:25:00:: in the upper lip---lip%1:08:00:: like a slide---slide%1:06:03:: .
When Papa---papa%1:18:00:: 's slender fingers---finger%1:08:00:: removed the spectacles---spectacles%1:06:00:: , there were red indentations---indentation%1:25:00:: on the bridge---bridge%1:08:00:: of the strong nose---nose%1:08:00:: .
`` It 's time---time%1:28:06:: you began to think on God---god%1:18:00:: , Stephen---person%1:03:00:: .
Perhaps one day---day%1:28:03:: He will choose you as He chose me , long ago .
Therefore , give Him your affection---affection%1:12:00:: and store up His love---love%1:12:00:: for you .
Open your heart---heart%1:09:00:: to Him and pray , Stephen---person%1:03:00:: , pray !
For His mercy---mercy%1:04:00:: and His guidance---guidance%1:10:00:: to spare you from evil---evil%1:07:02:: and eternal punishment---punishment%1:04:00:: in the Lake of Fire---location%1:03:00:: '' .
Stevie---person%1:03:00:: had heard these words---word%1:10:00:: many times---time%1:11:00:: , yet on each occasion---occasion%1:11:00:: they caused him to tremble .
For he feared the Lake of Fire---location%1:03:00:: .
He strove to think of God---god%1:18:00:: and His eternal wrath---wrath%1:12:00:: ; he must pray to be spared .
Papa---person%1:03:00:: was disappointed that none of the brothers---brother%1:18:00:: had heard the Call---call%1:09:00:: .
Not George---person%1:03:00:: , Townley---person%1:03:00:: , or Ted---person%1:03:00:: , certainly not Ludie---person%1:03:00:: .
Burt---person%1:03:00:: was at Hackettstown---location%1:03:00:: and Will---person%1:03:00:: at Albany Law School---group%1:03:00:: , where they surely could not hear it .
Someday God---god%1:18:00:: would choose him .
He would hear the Call---call%1:09:00:: and would run to tell Papa---papa%1:18:00:: .
The stern face---face%1:08:00:: would relax , the black clad arms---arm%1:08:00:: would embrace him , `` My son---son%1:18:00:: '' !
Yet how might he know the Call---call%1:09:00:: when it came ?
Probably , as in Scriptures---scripture%1:10:00:: , a still , small voice---voice%1:10:00:: would whisper .
He was Papa---papa%1:18:00:: 's chosen---chosen%1:18:00:: ; therefore , nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but good---good%1:07:02:: could happen to him , even in God---god%1:18:00:: 's wrathful storms---storm%1:19:00:: .
When the skies---sky%1:17:00:: grew dark and thunder---thunder%1:11:01:: rolled across the valley---valley%1:17:00:: , he was unafraid .
Aggie---person%1:03:00:: might fly into a closet---closet%1:06:03:: , shut the door---door%1:06:00:: and bury her head---head%1:08:00:: in the clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: ; he dared to wait for the lightning---lightning%1:19:00:: .
Lightning---lightning%1:19:00:: could strike you blind if you were a sinner---sinner%1:18:00:: !
He clenched his fists---fist%1:08:00:: and faced the terror---terror%1:12:00:: .
Thunder---thunder%1:11:01:: crashed ; barrels tumbled down the mountainsides---mountainside%1:17:00:: , and bounced and bounced till their own fury---fury%1:07:00:: split them open .
Lightning---lightning%1:19:00:: might strike the steeples---steeple%1:06:00:: of the other churches---church%1:06:00:: ; not of Drew Church---group%1:03:00:: .
A flash---flash%1:11:00:: illumined the trees---tree%1:20:00:: as a crooked bolt---bolt%1:19:00:: twigged in several directions---direction%1:24:00:: .
Violet whinnied from the stable---stable%1:06:00:: .
He ran out into the downpour---downpour%1:19:00:: , sped across the yard---yard%1:06:02:: and into the buggy---buggy%1:06:00:: room---room%1:06:00:: .
he shouted , and was aghast at the echoes---echo%1:07:00:: .
If there was a fire---fire%1:11:00:: or a flood---flood%1:19:00:: he would save Mama---mama%1:18:00:: first and Violet next .
Drenched and shaking , he stood near the sweet-smelling stall---stall%1:06:00:: and dared to pat her muzzle---muzzle%1:05:00:: .
After the storm---storm%1:19:00:: , the sky---sky%1:17:00:: cleared blue and cool , and fragrant air---air%1:19:00:: swept the hills .
When the sun---sun%1:17:00:: came out , Stevie---person%1:03:00:: strode proudly into Orange Square---location%1:03:00:: , smiling like a landlord---landlord%1:18:00:: on industrious tenants---tenant%1:18:00:: .
The fountain---fountain%1:06:02:: had brimmed over , the cannon---cannon%1:06:00:: were wet , the soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: ' monument---monument%1:06:00:: glistened .
Even before the benches---bench%1:06:00:: had dried , the Civil War---civil_war%1:04:00:: veterans---veteran%1:18:01:: were straggling back to their places---place%1:15:03:: .
The great spire---spire%1:06:00:: shone as if the lightning---lightning%1:19:00:: had polished it .
The pointed shadow---shadow%1:26:01:: had nearly touched him .
He trailed Ludie---person%1:03:00:: to the baseball game---baseball_game%1:04:00:: in the lot---lot%1:15:00:: on Kingston Street---location%1:03:00:: near the Dutch Reformed---group%1:03:00:: .
`` Go on home---home%1:15:04:: '' !
Ludie---person%1:03:00:: screeched at him .
`` Someone 'll tell Papa---papa%1:18:00:: '' !
No one told on Ludie---person%1:03:00:: , not even when he slipped live grasshoppers---grasshopper%1:05:00:: into the mite-box---mite_box%1:06:00:: .
Ludie---person%1:03:00:: did as he pleased .
Ludie---person%1:03:00:: took his slingshot---slingshot%1:06:00:: and climbed to the rooftop---rooftop%1:15:00:: to shoot at crows---crow%1:05:00:: .
Ludie---person%1:03:00:: chewed roofer---roofer%1:18:00:: 's tar---tar%1:27:00:: .
Ludie---person%1:03:00:: had a cigar box---cigar_box%1:06:00:: full of marbles---marble%1:06:00:: and shooters---shooter%1:06:00:: , and a Roman candle---roman_candle%1:06:00:: from last Fourth of July---fourth_of_july%1:28:00:: .
Ludie---person%1:03:00:: hopped rides---ride%1:04:00:: on freight cars---freight_car%1:06:00:: , and was chased by Mr. Yankton---person%1:03:00:: , the railroad---railroad%1:06:00:: guard---guard%1:18:03:: .
He came home---home%1:15:04:: overheated , ran straight to the ice-chest---ice_chest%1:06:00:: , and gulped shivery cold water---water%1:27:00:: .
Stevie---person%1:03:00:: envied him .
That Ludie---person%1:03:00:: !
He , too , cocked his cap---cap%1:06:00:: at a jaunty angle---angle%1:25:00:: , jingled marbles---marble%1:06:00:: in his pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: , and swaggered down Main Street---location%1:03:00:: .
On the Christophers---person%1:03:00:: ' lawn---lawn%1:15:00:: , little girls---girl%1:18:02:: in white pinafores---pinafore%1:06:00:: were playing grownups---grownup%1:18:01:: at a tea party---tea_party%1:11:00:: .
A Newfoundland---newfoundland%1:05:00:: sat solemnly beside a doghouse---doghouse%1:06:00:: half his size---size%1:07:00:: .
Stevie---person%1:03:00:: yearned for a dog---dog%1:05:00:: .
He wondered whether God---god%1:18:00:: had a dog---dog%1:05:00:: in the sky---sky%1:17:00:: .
He meandered down Pike Street---location%1:03:00:: , past the First National Bank---group%1:03:00:: with its green window shades---window_shade%1:06:00:: .
He crossed the tracks---track%1:06:02:: to Delaware House---group%1:03:00:: , where ladies---lady%1:18:02:: in gay dresses---dress%1:06:00:: and men---man%1:18:00:: in straw---straw%1:27:00:: boaters---boater%1:06:00:: and waxed mustaches---mustache%1:08:00:: crowded the verandah---verandah%1:06:00:: .
A tall lady---lady%1:18:02:: , with a ruffled collar---collar%1:06:00:: very low on her bosom---bosom%1:08:01:: , turned insolent green eyes---eye%1:08:00:: upon him .
She was taller than Aggie---person%1:03:00:: .
She was so beautiful with her rosy mouth---mouth%1:08:00:: and haughty air---air%1:07:00:: that she had to be wicked .
Fiddles---fiddle%1:06:00:: screeched ; a piano---piano%1:06:00:: tinkled .
`` P.J.---location%1:03:00:: '' - as Ludie---person%1:03:00:: called the town---town%1:15:00:: - was crowded with summer---summer%1:28:00:: people---people%1:14:00:: who came to the mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: to escape the heat---heat%1:07:01:: in the big cities---city%1:15:00:: .
They stayed at hotels---hotel%1:06:00:: and boardinghouses---boardinghouse%1:06:00:: , or at private homes---home%1:15:04:: .
Rich people---people%1:14:00:: went to Delaware House---group%1:03:00:: , Opera House---group%1:03:00:: , American House---group%1:03:00:: or Fowler House---group%1:03:00:: .
The thermal exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: of chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: between * * f and liquid * * f is readily measurable at temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: in the range---range%1:07:00:: of 180 ` and above .
The photochemical exchange---photochemical_exchange%1:19:00:: occurs with a quantum yield---yield%1:04:00:: of the order---order%1:07:01:: of unity---unity%1:23:00:: in the liquid---liquid%1:26:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: at 65 ` using light---light%1:19:00:: absorbed only by the * * f .
In the gas---gas%1:26:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: , with * * f of * * f and * * f of * * f , quantum yields---yield%1:04:00:: of the order---order%1:07:01:: of * * f have been observed at 85 ` .
Despite extensive attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: to obtain highly pure reagents---reagent%1:27:00:: , serious difficulty---difficulty%1:09:02:: was experienced in obtaining reproducible rates---rate%1:28:00:: of reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: .
It appears possible to set a lower limit---lower_limit%1:23:00:: of about * * f for the activation energy---activation_energy%1:19:00:: of the abstraction---abstraction%1:04:00:: of a chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: atom---atom%1:27:00:: from a carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: molecule---molecule%1:27:00:: by a chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: atom---atom%1:27:00:: to form * * f radical---radical%1:27:00:: .
The rate---rate%1:28:00:: of the gas---gas%1:26:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: appears to be proportional to the first power---power%1:10:00:: of the absorbed light---light%1:19:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: indicating that the radical---radical%1:27:00:: intermediates---intermediate%1:27:00:: are removed at the walls---wall%1:06:00:: or by reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: with an impurity---impurity%1:27:00:: rather than by bimolecular radical---radical%1:27:00:: combination reactions---reaction%1:22:00:: .
Because of the simplicity---simplicity%1:07:02:: of the molecules---molecule%1:27:00:: , isotopic exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: reactions---reaction%1:22:00:: between elemental halogens---halogen%1:27:00:: and the corresponding carbon tetrahalides---carbon_tetrahalide%1:27:00:: would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibilities---possibility%1:09:01:: for obtaining unambiguous basic kinetic data---data%1:14:00:: .
It would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanisms---mechanism%1:22:00:: for the thermal and photochemical reactions---photochemical_reaction%1:22:00:: in both the liquid---liquid%1:26:00:: and gas---gas%1:26:00:: phases---phase%1:26:00:: and to determine values---value%1:09:00:: for activation energies---activation_energy%1:19:00:: of some of the intermediate reactions---reaction%1:22:00:: of atoms---atom%1:27:00:: and free radicals---free_radical%1:27:00:: , as well as information---information%1:09:00:: on the heat of dissociation---heat_of_dissociation%1:19:00:: of the carbon---carbon%1:27:00:: halogen---halogen%1:27:00:: bond---bond%1:19:00:: .
The reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: of chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: with carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: seemed particularly suited for such studies---study%1:04:00:: .
It should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: by oxidation---oxidation%1:22:00:: of inorganic chlorides---chloride%1:27:00:: on a vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: system---system%1:09:01:: followed by multiple distillation---distillation%1:22:00:: of the liquid---liquid%1:27:04:: .
It should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: of any interfering substances---substance%1:03:00:: by the usual purification---purification%1:04:00:: methods---method%1:09:00:: followed by prechlorination---prechlorination%1:22:00:: prior to addition---addition%1:04:02:: of radioactive chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: .
Furthermore , the exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: would not be expected to be sensitive to trace---trace%1:23:00:: amounts---amount%1:03:00:: of impurities---impurity%1:27:00:: because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction---chain_reaction%1:22:01:: since the activation energy---activation_energy%1:19:00:: for abstraction---abstraction%1:04:00:: of chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: by a chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: atom---atom%1:27:00:: would be expected to be too high ; also it would be expected that * * f would compete very effectively with any impurities---impurity%1:27:00:: as a scavenger---scavenger%1:27:00:: for * * f radicals---radical%1:27:00:: .
Contrary to these expectations---expectation%1:26:00:: we have found it impossible to obtain the degree---degree%1:26:01:: of reproducibility---reproducibility%1:07:00:: one would wish , even with extensive efforts---effort%1:04:00:: to prepare especially pure reagents---reagent%1:27:00:: .
We are reporting these investigations---investigation%1:04:00:: here briefly because of their relevancy---relevancy%1:24:00:: to problems---problem%1:26:00:: of the study---study%1:04:00:: of apparently simple exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: reactions---reaction%1:22:00:: of chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: and because the results---result%1:10:00:: furnish some information---information%1:09:00:: on the activation energy---activation_energy%1:19:00:: for abstraction---abstraction%1:04:00:: of chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: atoms---atom%1:27:00:: from carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: .
Matheson---person%1:03:00:: highest purity---purity%1:26:00:: tank---tank%1:06:00:: chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: was passed through a tube---tube%1:06:00:: of resublimed * * f into an evacuated Pyrex---pyrex%1:27:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: where it was condensed with liquid air---liquid_air%1:27:00:: .
It was then distilled at least three times---time%1:11:00:: from a trap---trap%1:06:04:: at - 78 ` to a liquid air---liquid_air%1:27:00:: trap---trap%1:06:04:: with only a small middle---middle%1:15:00:: fraction---fraction%1:27:00:: being retained in each distillation---distillation%1:22:00:: .
The purified product---product%1:06:00:: was stored at - 78 ` in a tube---tube%1:06:00:: equipped with a break seal---break_seal%1:06:00:: .
Of several methods---method%1:09:00:: employed for tagging chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: with radiochlorine---radiochlorine%1:27:00:: , the exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: of inactive chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: with tagged aluminum chloride---aluminum_chloride%1:27:00:: at room temperature---room_temperature%1:07:00:: was found to be the most satisfactory .
To prepare the latter , silver chloride---silver_chloride%1:27:00:: was precipitated from a solution---solution%1:27:00:: containing * * f obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory---group%1:03:00:: .
The silver chloride---silver_chloride%1:27:00:: was fused under vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: in the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of aluminum---aluminum%1:27:00:: chips---chip%1:17:00:: with the resultant product---product%1:27:00:: of * * f which was sublimed into a flask---flask%1:06:00:: on the vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: line---line%1:06:06:: .
Previously purified chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: was subsequently admitted and the exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: was allowed to take place .
The radiochlorine---radiochlorine%1:27:00:: was stored at - 78 ` in a tube---tube%1:06:00:: equipped with a break seal---break_seal%1:06:00:: .
Liter---liter%1:23:00:: quantities---quantity%1:07:00:: of Mallinckrodt , low sulfur---sulfur%1:27:00:: , reagent---reagent%1:27:00:: grade---grade%1:26:00:: carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: were saturated with * * f and * * f and illuminated for about 50 hours---hour%1:28:00:: with a 1000 watt---watt%1:23:00:: tungsten---tungsten%1:27:00:: lamp---lamp%1:06:00:: at a distance---distance%1:07:00:: of a few inches---inch%1:23:00:: .
The mixture---mixture%1:27:00:: was then extracted with alkali---alkali%1:27:00:: and with water---water%1:27:00:: following which the carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: was distilled on a Vigreux---person%1:03:00:: column---column%1:06:02:: , a 25 % center---center%1:15:01:: cut---cut%1:06:00:: being retained which was then degassed under vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: in the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of * * f .
Purified inactive chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: was then added from one of the tubes---tube%1:06:00:: described above and the mixture---mixture%1:27:00:: frozen out and sealed off in a flask---flask%1:06:00:: equipped with a break seal---break_seal%1:06:00:: .
This chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: solution---solution%1:27:00:: was illuminated for a day---day%1:28:00:: following which the flask---flask%1:06:00:: was resealed onto a vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: and the excess chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: distilled off .
The required amount---amount%1:07:00:: of carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: was distilled into a series---series%1:14:00:: of reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: on a manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: on a vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: line---line%1:06:06:: .
The desired amounts---amount%1:03:00:: of inactive chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: and radioactive chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: were likewise condensed in these cells---cell%1:06:03:: on the vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: line---line%1:06:06:: following which they were frozen down and the manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: as a whole was sealed off .
The contents---content%1:14:00:: of the manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: for liquid---liquid%1:27:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: experiments---experiment%1:09:00:: were then mixed by shaking---shaking%1:04:00:: , redistributed to the reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: tubes---tube%1:06:00:: , frozen down , and each tube---tube%1:06:00:: was then sealed off .
The reactants---reactant%1:27:00:: for the gas---gas%1:26:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: experiments---experiment%1:09:00:: were first frozen out in a side arm---arm%1:06:03:: attached to the manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: and then allowed to distill slowly into the manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: of pre-cooled reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: before sealing off .
This method---method%1:09:00:: in general solved the problem---problem%1:26:00:: of obtaining fairly equal concentrations---concentration%1:07:02:: of reactants---reactant%1:27:00:: in each of the six cells---cell%1:06:03:: from a set---set%1:14:00:: .
The samples---sample%1:09:00:: for liquid---liquid%1:26:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: thermal reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: studies---study%1:04:00:: were prepared in Pyrex---pyrex%1:27:00:: capillary tubing---capillary_tubing%1:06:00:: 2.5 mm.---mm%1:23:00:: i.d. and about 15 cm.---cm%1:23:00:: long .
In a few experiments---experiment%1:09:00:: the tubes---tube%1:06:00:: were made from standard 6 mm.---mm%1:23:00:: i.d. Pyrex---pyrex%1:27:00:: tubing---tubing%1:06:00:: of 1 mm.---mm%1:23:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: thickness---thickness%1:07:01:: .
Both types---type%1:09:00:: of tube---tube%1:06:00:: withstood the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: of approximately 20 atmospheres---atmosphere%1:23:00:: exerted by the carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: at 220 ` .
The photochemical reaction---photochemical_reaction%1:22:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: consisted of 10 mm.---mm%1:23:00:: i.d. Pyrex---pyrex%1:27:00:: tubing---tubing%1:06:00:: , 5.5 cm.---cm%1:23:00:: long , diffraction---diffraction%1:19:00:: effects---effect%1:19:00:: being minimized by the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that the light---light%1:19:00:: passed through only liquid---liquid%1:27:04:: glass---glass%1:27:00:: interfaces---interface%1:06:00:: and not gas---gas%1:27:00:: glass---glass%1:27:00:: interfaces---interface%1:06:00:: .
These cells---cell%1:06:03:: were used rather than square Pyrex---pyrex%1:27:00:: tubing---tubing%1:06:00:: because of the tendency---tendency%1:07:00:: of the latter to shatter when thawing frozen carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: .
The round cells---cell%1:06:03:: were reproducibly positioned in the light beam---light_beam%1:19:00:: which entered the thermostated mineral oil---mineral_oil%1:27:00:: bath---bath%1:06:02:: through a window---window%1:06:02:: .
Two types---type%1:09:00:: of light---light%1:19:00:: source---source%1:15:00:: were used , a thousand watt---watt%1:23:00:: projection---projection%1:10:00:: lamp---lamp%1:06:00:: and an AH6 high pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: mercury---mercury%1:27:00:: arc---arc%1:19:00:: .
The light---light%1:19:00:: was filtered by the soft glass---soft_glass%1:27:00:: window---window%1:06:02:: of the thermostat---thermostat%1:06:00:: thus ensuring that only light---light%1:19:00:: absorbed by the chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: and not by the carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: could enter the reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: .
Relative incident light---light%1:19:00:: intensities---intensity%1:07:03:: were measured with a thermopile---thermopile%1:06:00:: potentiometer---potentiometer%1:06:01:: system---system%1:06:00:: .
Changes---change%1:19:00:: of intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: on the cell---cell%1:06:03:: were achieved by use---use%1:04:00:: of a wire---wire%1:06:00:: screen---screen%1:06:01:: and by varying the distance---distance%1:07:00:: of the light---light%1:19:00:: source---source%1:15:00:: from the cell---cell%1:06:03:: .
Following reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: the cells---cell%1:06:03:: were scratched with a file---file%1:06:00:: and opened under a 20 % aqueous sodium iodide---sodium_iodide%1:27:00:: solution---solution%1:27:00:: .
Carrier---carrier%1:27:00:: * * f was added and the aqueous and organic phases---phase%1:26:00:: were separated ( cells---cell%1:06:03:: containing gaseous reactants---reactant%1:27:00:: were immersed in liquid air---liquid_air%1:27:00:: before opening under sodium iodide---sodium_iodide%1:27:00:: ) .
After titration---titration%1:04:00:: of the liberated * * f with * * f , aliquots---aliquot%1:23:00:: of the aqueous and of the organic phase---phase%1:26:00:: were counted in a solution---solution%1:27:00:: type---type%1:09:00:: Geiger tube---geiger_tube%1:06:00:: .
In the liquid---liquid%1:26:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: runs---run%1:04:06:: the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: in each reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: tube---tube%1:06:00:: was determined by weighing the tube---tube%1:06:00:: before opening and weighing the fragments---fragment%1:17:01:: after emptying .
The fraction---fraction%1:23:00:: of exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: was determined as the ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: of the counts---count%1:23:00:: / minute---minute%1:28:00:: observed in the carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: to the counts---count%1:23:00:: / minute---minute%1:28:00:: calculated for the carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: for equilibrium---equilibrium%1:22:00:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: of the activity---activity%1:26:00:: between the chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: and carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: , empirically determined correction---correction%1:10:01:: being made for the difference---difference%1:07:00:: in counting---counting%1:04:00:: efficiency---efficiency%1:24:00:: of * * f in * * f and * * f .
In studying the liquid---liquid%1:27:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: thermal reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: , some 70 tubes---tube%1:06:00:: from 12 different manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: fillings---filling%1:27:00:: were prepared and analyzed .
Experiments---experiment%1:09:00:: were done at 180 , 200 , 210 , 220 ` .
Following observation---observation%1:04:01:: of the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that the reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: of supposedly identical reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: mixtures---mixture%1:27:00:: prepared on the same filling---filling%1:27:00:: manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: and exposed under identical conditions---condition%1:26:00:: often differed by several hundred---hundred%1:23:00:: per cent---percent%1:24:00:: , a systematic series---series%1:14:00:: of experiments---experiment%1:09:00:: was undertaken to see whether the difficulty---difficulty%1:09:02:: could be ascribed to the method---method%1:09:00:: of preparing the chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: , to the effects---effect%1:19:00:: of oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: or moisture---moisture%1:26:00:: or to the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of surface---surface%1:15:00:: to volume---volume%1:23:00:: ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: in the reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: tubes---tube%1:06:00:: .
In addition to the method---method%1:09:00:: described in the section---section%1:10:00:: above , chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: and radiochlorine---radiochlorine%1:27:00:: were prepared by the electrolysis---electrolysis%1:22:00:: of a * * f eutectic---eutectic%1:27:00:: on the vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: line---line%1:06:06:: , and by exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: of * * f with molten * * f .
Calcium hydride---calcium_hydride%1:27:00:: was substituted for * * f as a drying agent---drying_agent%1:27:00:: for carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: .
No correlation---correlation%1:24:00:: between these variables---variable%1:09:00:: and the irreproducibility---irreproducibility%1:07:00:: of the results---result%1:19:00:: was found .
The reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: observed at 200 ` ranged from * * f of the chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: exchanged per hour---hour%1:28:00:: to 0.7 exchanged per hour---hour%1:28:00:: .
In most cases---case%1:11:00:: the chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: was about * * f .
Sets---set%1:14:00:: of reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: tubes---tube%1:06:00:: containing 0.2 of an atmosphere---atmosphere%1:23:00:: of added oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: in one case---case%1:11:00:: and added moisture---moisture%1:26:00:: in another , both gave reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: in the range---range%1:07:00:: of 0.1 to 0.4 of the chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: exchanged per hour---hour%1:28:00:: .
No detectable reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: was found at room temperature---room_temperature%1:07:00:: for reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: mixtures---mixture%1:27:00:: allowed to stand up to 5 hours---hour%1:28:00:: .
The liquid---liquid%1:26:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: photochemical exchange---photochemical_exchange%1:19:00:: between chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: and carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: was more reproducible than the thermal exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: , although still erratic .
The improvement---improvement%1:26:00:: was most noticeable in the greater consistency---consistency%1:07:02:: among reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: prepared as a group on the same manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: .
Rather large differences---difference%1:07:00:: were still found between reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: from different manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: fillings---filling%1:27:00:: .
Some 80 reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: tubes---tube%1:06:00:: from 13 manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: fillings---filling%1:27:00:: were illuminated in the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: from 40 to 85 ` in a further endeavor---endeavor%1:04:01:: to determine the cause---cause%1:03:00:: of the irreproducibility---irreproducibility%1:07:00:: and to obtain information---information%1:09:00:: on the activation energy---activation_energy%1:19:00:: and the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of light---light%1:19:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: .
In all cases---case%1:11:00:: there was readily measurable exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: after as little as one hour---hour%1:28:00:: of illumination---illumination%1:26:00:: .
By comparing reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: sealed from the same manifold---manifold%1:06:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: dependency---dependency%1:26:00:: corresponding to activation energies---activation_energy%1:19:00:: ranging from 11 to 18 * * f was observed while dependence---dependence%1:26:00:: on the first power---power%1:10:00:: of the light---light%1:19:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: seemed to be indicated in most cases---case%1:11:00:: .
It was possible to make estimates---estimate%1:09:00:: of the quantum yield---yield%1:04:00:: by observing the extent---extent%1:07:00:: of reduction---reduction%1:22:00:: of a uranyl oxalate---uranyl_oxalate%1:27:00:: actinometer---actinometer%1:06:00:: solution---solution%1:27:00:: illuminated for a known time---time%1:28:05:: in a typical reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: and making appropriate conversions---conversion%1:09:00:: based on the differences in the absorption spectra---absorption_spectrum%1:19:00:: of uranyl oxalate---uranyl_oxalate%1:27:00:: and of chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: , and considering the spectral distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: of the light---light%1:19:00:: source---source%1:15:00:: .
These estimates---estimate%1:09:00:: indicated that the quantum yield---yield%1:04:00:: for the exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: of chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: with liquid carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: at 65 ` is of the order of magnitude---order_of_magnitude%1:07:00:: of unity---unity%1:23:00:: .
When typical reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: cells---cell%1:06:03:: to which 0.3 of an atmosphere---atmosphere%1:23:00:: of oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: had been added were illuminated , chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: and phosgene---phosgene%1:27:00:: were produced .
Exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: was also observed in these cells---cell%1:06:03:: , which had chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: present at * * f .
Although there was some variation---variation%1:11:01:: in results---result%1:19:00:: which must be attributed either to trace---trace%1:23:00:: impurities---impurity%1:26:00:: or to variation---variation%1:11:01:: in wall---wall%1:06:00:: effects---effect%1:19:00:: , the photochemical exchange---photochemical_exchange%1:19:00:: in the gas---gas%1:26:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: was sufficiently reproducible so that it seemed meaningful to compare the reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: in different series---series%1:14:00:: of reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: tubes---tube%1:06:00:: for the purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of obtaining information---information%1:09:00:: on the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of chlorine---chlorine%1:27:00:: concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: and of carbon tetrachloride---carbon_tetrachloride%1:27:00:: concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: on the reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: rate---rate%1:28:00:: .
Data---data%1:14:00:: on such comparisons---comparison%1:24:00:: together with data---data%1:14:00:: on the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of light---light%1:19:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: are given in Table---table%1:14:00:: /1 .
In series---series%1:14:00:: /1 , the relative light---light%1:19:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: was varied by varying the distance---distance%1:07:00:: of the lamp---lamp%1:06:00:: from the reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: cell---cell%1:06:03:: over the range---range%1:07:00:: from 14.7 to 29.2 cm.---cm%1:23:00:: .
The last column---column%1:14:01:: shows the rate---rate%1:28:00:: of exchange---exchange%1:19:00:: that would have been observed at a relative intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: of 4 ( 14.7 cm.---cm%1:23:00:: distance---distance%1:07:00:: ) calculated on the assumptions---assumption%1:09:00:: that the incident light---light%1:19:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: is inversely proportional to the square---square%1:23:00:: of the distance---distance%1:07:01:: of the lamp---lamp%1:06:00:: from the cell---cell%1:06:03:: and that the rate---rate%1:28:00:: is directly proportional to the incident light---light%1:19:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: .
Direct proportionality---proportionality%1:24:00:: of the rate---rate%1:28:00:: to the incident intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: has also been assumed in obtaining the value---value%1:09:00:: in the last column---column%1:14:01:: for the fourth sample---sample%1:09:00:: of series---series%1:14:00:: /2 , where the light---light%1:19:00:: intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: was reduced by use---use%1:04:00:: of a screen---screen%1:06:01:: .
The expense---expense%1:21:00:: and time---time%1:28:05:: involved are astronomical .
However , we sent a third vessel---vessel%1:06:00:: out , a much smaller and faster one than the first two---two%1:23:00:: .
We have learned much---much%1:23:00:: about interstellar drives---drive%1:04:04:: since a hundred years---year%1:28:01:: ago ; that is all I can tell you about them .
`` But the third ship---ship%1:06:00:: came back several years---year%1:28:01:: ago and reported & & & '' .
`` That it had found a planet---planet%1:17:00:: on which human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: could live and which was already inhabited by sentient beings---being%1:03:00:: '' ! said Hal---person%1:03:00:: , forgetting in his enthusiasm---enthusiasm%1:07:00:: that he had not been asked to speak .
Macneff---person%1:03:00:: stopped pacing to stare at Hal---person%1:03:00:: with his pale blue eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
`` Forgive me , Sandalphon---person%1:03:00:: '' , said Hal---person%1:03:00:: .
Did not the Forerunner---person%1:03:00:: predict in his Time---time%1:28:00:: and the World Line---location%1:03:00:: that such a planet---planet%1:17:00:: would be found ?
I believe it was on page---page%1:10:00:: 573 '' !
Macneff---person%1:03:00:: smiled and said , `` I am glad that your scriptural lessons---lesson%1:04:00:: have left such an impression---impression%1:09:00:: '' .
thought Hal---person%1:03:00:: .
Besides , they were not the only impressions---impression%1:09:00:: .
I still bear scars---scar%1:26:00:: on my back---back%1:08:00:: where Pornsen---person%1:03:00:: , my gapt , whipped me because I had not learned my lessons---lesson%1:04:00:: well enough .
He was a good impresser , that Pornsen---person%1:03:00:: .
He was my gapt in the creche---creche%1:06:00:: .
He was the dormitory---dormitory%1:06:00:: gapt when I went to college---college%1:14:00:: and thought I was getting away from him .
He is now my block---block%1:06:06:: gapt .
Swiftly , came the revulsion---revulsion%1:12:00:: , the protest---protest%1:10:00:: .
If I get a low M. R. , I do so because I want it that way---way%1:26:00:: or my dark self---self%1:09:00:: does .
So , forgive me , Sigmen---person%1:03:00:: , for the contrary to reality---reality%1:26:01:: thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: !
`` Please pardon me again , Sandalphon---person%1:03:00:: '' , said Hal---person%1:03:00:: .
`` But did the expedition---expedition%1:14:00:: find any records---record%1:10:03:: of the Forerunner---person%1:03:00:: having been on this planet---planet%1:17:00:: ?
Perhaps , even , though this is too much to wish , find the Forerunner---person%1:03:00:: himself '' ?
`` No---no%1:10:00:: '' , said Macneff---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Though that does not mean that there may not be such records---record%1:10:03:: there .
The expedition---expedition%1:04:01:: was under orders---order%1:10:03:: to make a swift survey---survey%1:04:01:: of conditions---condition%1:26:00:: and then to return to Earth---earth%1:17:00:: .
I can n't tell you now the distance---distance%1:07:01:: in light years---light_year%1:23:00:: or what star---star%1:17:00:: this was , though you can see it with the naked eye---eye%1:08:00:: at night---night%1:28:00:: in this hemisphere---hemisphere%1:15:00:: .
If you volunteer , you will be told where you 're going after the ship---ship%1:06:00:: leaves .
`` You need a linguist---linguist%1:18:01:: '' ? said Hal---person%1:03:00:: .
`` The ship---ship%1:06:00:: is huge '' , said Macneff---person%1:03:00:: , `` but the number---number%1:23:00:: of military men---military_man%1:18:00:: and specialists---specialist%1:18:00:: we are taking limits the linguists---linguist%1:18:01:: to one .
We have considered several of your professionals---professional%1:18:00:: because they were lamechians and above suspicion---suspicion%1:09:00:: .
Hal---person%1:03:00:: waited : Macneff---person%1:03:00:: paced some more , frowning .
Then , he said , `` Unfortunately , only one lamechian linguist---linguist%1:18:01:: exists , and he is too old for this expedition---expedition%1:04:01:: .
`` A thousand pardons---pardon%1:04:00:: '' , said Hal---person%1:03:00:: .
`` But I have just thought of one thing---thing%1:09:02:: .
`` No problem---problem%1:26:00:: at all '' , said Macneff---person%1:03:00:: .
`` There will be no women---woman%1:18:00:: aboard the Gabriel .
And , if a man---man%1:18:00:: is married , he will automatically be given a divorce---divorce%1:04:00:: '' .
Hal---person%1:03:00:: gasped , and he said , `` A divorce---divorce%1:04:00:: '' ?
Macneff---person%1:03:00:: raised his hands---hand%1:08:00:: apologetically and said , `` You are horrified , of course .
But , from our reading---reading%1:09:01:: of the Western Talmud , we Urielites believe that the Forerunner---person%1:03:00:: , knowing this situation---situation%1:26:00:: would arise , made reference---reference%1:10:02:: to and provision---provision%1:09:00:: for divorce---divorce%1:04:00:: .
It 's inevitable in this case---case%1:26:00:: , for the couple---couple%1:14:01:: will be separated for , at the least , forty years---year%1:28:01:: .
Naturally , he couched the provision---provision%1:10:00:: in obscure language---language%1:10:00:: .
In his great and glorious wisdom---wisdom%1:07:00:: , he knew that our enemies---enemy%1:14:01:: the Israelites must not be able to read therein what we planned '' .
`` I volunteer '' , said Hal---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Tell me more , Sandalphon---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Six months---month%1:28:00:: later , Hal Yarrow---person%1:03:00:: stood in the observation dome---observation_dome%1:06:00:: of the Gabriel and watched the ball---ball%1:25:00:: of Earth---location%1:03:00:: dwindle above him .
It was night---night%1:28:00:: on this hemisphere---hemisphere%1:15:00:: , but the light---light%1:19:00:: blazed from the megalopolises---megalopolis%1:15:00:: of Australia---australia%1:15:00:: , Japan---japan%1:15:00:: , China---china%1:15:00:: , Southeast Asia---location%1:03:00:: , India---india%1:15:00:: , Siberia---siberia%1:15:00:: .
Hal---person%1:03:00:: , the linguist---linguist%1:18:01:: , saw the glittering discs---disc%1:25:00:: and necklaces---necklace%1:06:00:: in terms of the languages---language%1:10:00:: spoken therein .
Australia---australia%1:15:00:: , the Philippine Islands---philippine_islands%1:15:00:: , Japan---japan%1:15:00:: , and northern China---china%1:15:00:: were inhabited by those members---member%1:18:00:: of the Haijac Union---group%1:03:00:: that spoke American---american%1:10:00:: .
Southern China---location%1:03:00:: , all of southeast---southeast%1:24:00:: Asia---asia%1:17:00:: , southern India---india%1:15:00:: and Ceylon---ceylon%1:15:00:: , these states---state%1:15:01:: of the Malay Federation---group%1:03:00:: spoke Bazaar .
Siberia---siberia%1:15:00:: spoke Icelandic---icelandic%1:10:00:: .
His mind---mind%1:09:00:: turned the globe---globe%1:17:00:: swiftly for him , and he visualized Africa---africa%1:17:00:: , which used Swahili---swahili%1:10:00:: south of the Sahara Sea---location%1:03:00:: .
All around the Mediterranean Sea---location%1:03:00:: , Asia Minor---asia_minor%1:15:00:: , northern India---india%1:15:00:: , and Tibet---tibet%1:15:00:: , Hebrew---hebrew%1:10:00:: was the native tongue---tongue%1:10:00:: .
In southern Europe---europe%1:17:00:: , between the Israeli---israeli%1:18:00:: Republics---republic%1:14:00:: and the Icelandic speaking peoples---people%1:14:00:: of northern Europe---europe%1:17:00:: , was a thin but long stretch---stretch%1:06:00:: of territory---territory%1:15:00:: called March---location%1:03:00:: .
This was no man's land---no_man's_land%1:15:00:: , disputed by the Haijac Union---group%1:03:00:: and the Israeli Republic---group%1:03:00:: , a potential source---source%1:15:00:: of war---war%1:26:00:: for the last two hundred years---year%1:28:01:: .
Neither nation---nation%1:14:00:: would give up their claim---claim%1:07:01:: on it , yet neither wished to make any move---move%1:04:00:: that might lead to a second Apocalyptic War .
So , for all practical purposes---purpose%1:07:00:: , it was an independent nation---nation%1:14:00:: and by now had its own organized government---government%1:14:00:: ( unrecognized outside its own borders---border%1:15:00:: ) .
Its citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: spoke all of the world---world%1:17:00:: 's surviving tongues---tongue%1:10:00:: , plus a new one called Lingo , a pidgin---pidgin%1:10:00:: whose vocabulary---vocabulary%1:10:00:: was derived from the other six---six%1:23:00:: and whose syntax---syntax%1:09:01:: was so simple it could be contained on half a sheet of paper---sheet_of_paper%1:10:00:: .
Hal---person%1:03:00:: saw in his mind---mind%1:09:00:: the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of Earth---earth%1:17:00:: : Iceland---iceland%1:15:00:: , Greenland---greenland%1:15:00:: , the Caribbean Islands---caribbean_island%1:15:00:: , and the eastern half---half%1:23:00:: of South America---south_america%1:17:00:: .
Here the peoples---people%1:14:00:: spoke the tongue---tongue%1:10:00:: of Iceland---iceland%1:15:00:: because that island---island%1:17:00:: had gotten the jump on the Hawaiian---hawaiian%1:10:00:: Americans---american%1:18:00:: who were busy resettling North America---north_america%1:17:00:: and the western half---half%1:23:00:: of South America---south_america%1:17:00:: after the Apocalyptic War .
Then there was North America---north_america%1:17:00:: , where American---american%1:10:00:: was the native speech---speech%1:10:00:: of all except the twenty descendants---descendant%1:18:00:: of French-Canadians---french_canadian%1:18:00:: living on the Hudson Bay Preserve---location%1:03:00:: .
Hal---person%1:03:00:: knew that when that side---side%1:15:02:: of Earth---earth%1:17:00:: rotated into the night---night%1:28:00:: zone---zone%1:15:00:: , Sigmen City---location%1:03:00:: would blaze out into space---space%1:03:00:: .
And , somewhere in that enormous light---light%1:15:00:: , was his apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: .
But Mary---person%1:03:00:: would soon no longer be living there , for she would be notified in a few days---day%1:28:00:: that her husband---husband%1:18:00:: had died in an accident---accident%1:11:01:: while on a flight---flight%1:04:00:: to Tahiti---location%1:03:00:: .
She would weep in private , he was sure , for she loved him in her frigid way---way%1:07:01:: , though in public she would be dry eyed .
Her friends---friend%1:18:00:: and professional---professional%1:18:01:: associates---associate%1:18:00:: would sympathize with her , not because she had lost a beloved husband---husband%1:18:00:: , but because she had been married to a man---man%1:18:00:: who thought unrealistically .
If Hal Yarrow---person%1:03:00:: had been killed in a crash---crash%1:11:00:: , he must have wanted it that way---way%1:26:00:: .
There was no such thing---thing%1:11:00:: as an `` accident---accident%1:11:01:: '' .
Somehow , all the other passengers---passenger%1:18:00:: ( also supposed to have died in this web---web%1:05:01:: of elaborate frauds---fraud%1:04:01:: to cover up the disappearance---disappearance%1:04:00:: of the personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: of the Gabriel ) had simultaneously `` agreed '' to die .
And , therefore , being in disgrace---disgrace%1:26:00:: , they would not be cremated and their ashes---ash%1:27:01:: flung to the winds---wind%1:19:00:: in public ceremony---ceremony%1:11:00:: .
No , the fish---fish%1:05:00:: could eat their bodies---body%1:08:00:: for all the Sturch---group%1:03:00:: cared .
Hal---person%1:03:00:: felt sorry for Mary---person%1:03:00:: ; he had a time keeping the tears---tears%1:04:00:: from welling to his own eyes---eye%1:08:00:: as he stood in the crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: in the observation dome---observation_dome%1:06:00:: .
Yet , he told himself , this was the best way---way%1:26:00:: .
He and Mary---person%1:03:00:: would no longer have to tear and rend at each other ; their mutual torture---torture%1:12:02:: would be over .
Mary---person%1:03:00:: was free to marry again , not knowing that the Sturch---group%1:03:00:: had secretly given her a divorce---divorce%1:04:00:: , thinking that death---death%1:26:00:: had dissolved her marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: .
She would have a year---year%1:28:01:: in which to make up her mind , to choose a mate---mate%1:18:00:: from a list---list%1:10:00:: selected by her gapt .
Perhaps , the psychological barriers---barrier%1:09:00:: that had prevented her from conceiving Hal---person%1:03:00:: 's child---child%1:18:01:: would no longer be present .
Hal---person%1:03:00:: doubted if this happy event---event%1:03:00:: would occur .
Mary---person%1:03:00:: was as frozen below the navel---navel%1:08:00:: as he .
No matter who the candidate---candidate%1:18:00:: for marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: selected by the gapt .
Pornsen---person%1:03:00:: .
He would no longer have to see that fat face---face%1:08:00:: , hear that whining voice---voice%1:07:00:: .
`` Hal Yarrow---person%1:03:00:: '' ! said the whining voice---voice%1:07:00:: .
And , slowly , feeling himself icy yet burning , Hal---person%1:03:00:: turned .
There was the squat loose jowled man---man%1:18:00:: , smiling lopsidedly up at him .
`` My beloved ward---ward%1:18:00:: , my perennial gadfly---gadfly%1:18:00:: '' , said the whining voice---voice%1:07:00:: .
`` I had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: that you , too , would be on this glorious voyage---voyage%1:04:00:: .
We seem to be bound by love---love%1:12:00:: ; Sigmen---person%1:03:00:: himself must have foreseen it .
Love---love%1:12:00:: to you , my ward---ward%1:18:00:: '' .
`` Sigmen---person%1:03:00:: love---love%1:12:00:: you , too , my guardian---guardian%1:18:00:: '' , said Hal---person%1:03:00:: , choking .
`` How wonderful to see your cherished self---self%1:18:00:: .
The Gabriel pointed towards her destination---destination%1:15:00:: and , under one gee---gee%1:23:00:: acceleration---acceleration%1:07:00:: , began to build up towards her ultimate velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: , 99.1 percent---percent%1:24:00:: of the speed of light---speed_of_light%1:28:00:: .
Meanwhile , all the personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: except those few needed to carry out the performance of the ship---ship%1:06:00:: , went into the suspensor .
Here they would lie in suspended animation---suspended_animation%1:26:00:: for many years---year%1:28:01:: .
Some time---time%1:28:05:: later , after a check had been made of all automatic equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: , the crew---crew%1:14:01:: would join the others .
They would sleep while the Gabriel 's drive---drive%1:04:04:: would increase the acceleration---acceleration%1:07:00:: to a point---point%1:26:00:: which the unfrozen bodies---body%1:08:00:: of the personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: could not have endured .
Upon reaching the desired speed---speed%1:28:00:: , the automatic equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: would cut off the drive---drive%1:04:04:: , and the silent but not empty vessel---vessel%1:06:00:: would hurl towards the star---star%1:17:00:: which was its journey---journey%1:04:00:: 's end---end%1:09:02:: .
Many years---year%1:28:01:: later , the photon---photon%1:17:00:: counting---counting%1:04:00:: apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: in the nose---nose%1:06:00:: of the ship---ship%1:06:00:: would determine that the star---star%1:17:00:: was close enough to actuate deceleration---deceleration%1:07:00:: .
Again , a force---force%1:19:00:: too strong for unfrozen bodies---body%1:08:00:: to endure would be applied .
Then , after slowing the vessel---vessel%1:06:00:: considerably , the drive---drive%1:04:04:: would adjust to a one gee---gee%1:23:00:: deceleration---deceleration%1:07:00:: .
And the crew---crew%1:14:01:: would be automatically brought out of their suspended animation---suspended_animation%1:26:00:: .
These members---member%1:18:00:: would then unthaw the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: .
And , in the half---half%1:23:00:: year---year%1:28:01:: left before reaching their destination---destination%1:15:00:: , the men---men%1:14:00:: would carry out whatever preparations---preparation%1:04:02:: were needed .
Hal Yarrow---person%1:03:00:: was among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out .
He had to study the recordings---recording%1:06:00:: of the language---language%1:10:00:: of the chief nation---nation%1:14:00:: of Ozagen , Siddo .
And , from the first---first%1:28:00:: , he faced a difficult task---task%1:04:00:: .
The expedition---expedition%1:04:01:: that had discovered Ozagen had succeeded in correlating two thousand---thousand%1:23:00:: Siddo words---word%1:10:00:: with an equal number---number%1:23:00:: of American words---word%1:10:00:: .
The description---description%1:10:01:: of the Siddo syntax---syntax%1:09:01:: was very restricted .
And , as Hal---person%1:03:00:: found out , obviously mistaken in many cases---case%1:11:00:: .
This discovery---discovery%1:09:00:: caused Hal---person%1:03:00:: anxiety---anxiety%1:12:00:: .
His duty---duty%1:04:00:: was to write a school text---school_text%1:10:00:: and to teach the entire personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: of the Gabriel how to speak Ozagen .
Yet , if he used all of the little means---means%1:04:00:: at his disposal---disposal%1:07:00:: , he would be instructing his students---student%1:18:00:: wrongly .
For one thing , the organs---organ%1:08:00:: of speech---speech%1:10:00:: of the Ozagen natives---native%1:18:00:: differed somewhat from Earthmen---earthman%1:18:00:: 's ; the sounds---sound%1:19:00:: made by these organs---organ%1:08:00:: were , therefore , dissimilar .
It was true that they could be approximated , but would the Ozagenians understand these approximations---approximation%1:07:00:: ?
Another obstacle---obstacle%1:09:00:: was the grammatical construction---construction%1:10:01:: of Siddo .
Consider the tense system---tense_system%1:10:00:: .
Instead of inflecting a verb---verb%1:10:01:: or using an unattached particle---particle%1:10:00:: to indicate the past---past%1:10:00:: or future---future%1:10:00:: , Siddo used an entirely different word---word%1:10:00:: .
Thus , the masculine animate infinitive---infinitive%1:10:00:: dabhumaksanigalu'ahai , meaning to live , was , in the perfect tense---perfect_tense%1:24:00:: , ksu'u'peli'afo , and , in the future---future%1:10:00:: , mai'teipa .
The same use of an entirely different word---word%1:10:00:: applied for all the other tenses---tense%1:10:00:: .
Plus the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that Siddo not only had the normal ( to Earthmen---earthman%1:18:00:: ) three genders---gender%1:10:00:: of masculine , feminine , and neuter---neuter%1:10:00:: , but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual .
Fortunately , gender---gender%1:10:00:: was inflected , though the expression---expression%1:10:00:: of it would be difficult for anybody not born in Siddo .
The system---system%1:09:00:: of indicating gender---gender%1:10:00:: varied according to tense---tense%1:10:00:: .
All the other parts of speech---part_of_speech%1:10:00:: : nouns---noun%1:10:01:: , pronouns---pronoun%1:10:00:: , adjectives---adjective%1:10:01:: , adverbs---adverb%1:10:01:: , and conjunctions---conjunction%1:10:00:: operated under the same system---system%1:09:00:: as the verbs---verb%1:10:01:: .
A Texas---texas%1:15:00:: halfback---halfback%1:18:00:: who does n't even know the team---team%1:14:00:: 's plays---play%1:04:05:: , Eldon Moritz---person%1:03:00:: , ranks fourth in Southwest Conference---group%1:03:00:: scoring after three games---game%1:04:00:: .
Time---time%1:03:00:: stands still every time---time%1:11:00:: Moritz---person%1:03:00:: , a 26 - year---year%1:28:01:: old Army Signal Corps---group%1:03:00:: veteran---veteran%1:18:01:: , goes into the field---field%1:15:02:: .
Although he never gets to play while the clock---clock%1:06:00:: is running , he gets a big kick---kick%1:12:00:: - several every Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: , in fact - out of football---football%1:04:00:: .
Moritz---person%1:03:00:: does n't even have a nose---nose%1:08:00:: guard---guard%1:06:00:: or hip pads---hip_pad%1:06:00:: but he 's one of the most valuable members---member%1:18:00:: of the Longhorn---group%1:03:00:: team---team%1:14:00:: that will be heavily favored Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: over Oklahoma---oklahoma%1:15:00:: in the cotton bowl .
That 's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries---try%1:04:00:: .
He ran his string---string%1:14:00:: of successful conversions---conversion%1:04:02:: this season---season%1:28:02:: to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: in the 41 - 8 slaughter---slaughter%1:11:00:: of Washington State---group%1:03:00:: .
Moritz---person%1:03:00:: is listed on the Longhorn---group%1:03:00:: roster---roster%1:10:01:: as a right halfback---halfback%1:18:00:: , the position---position%1:04:02:: at which he lettered on the 1956 team---team%1:14:00:: .
But ask coach---coach%1:18:01:: Darrell Royal---person%1:03:00:: what position---position%1:04:02:: he plays and you 'll get the quick response---response%1:10:01:: , `` place kicker---place-kicker%1:18:00:: '' .
A 208 - pound---pound%1:23:09:: , 6 - foot---foot%1:23:00:: 1 - inch---inch%1:23:00:: senior---senior%1:18:00:: from Stamford---location%1:03:00:: , Moritz---person%1:03:00:: practices nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but place-kicking---place-kicking%1:04:00:: .
Last year---year%1:28:01:: , when he worked out at halfback---halfback%1:18:00:: all season---season%1:28:02:: , he did n't get into a single game---game%1:04:00:: .
`` This year---year%1:28:01:: , coach---coach%1:18:01:: Royal---person%1:03:00:: told me if I 'd work on my place-kicking---place-kicking%1:04:00:: he thought he could use me '' , said Moritz---person%1:03:00:: .
`` So I started practicing on it in spring training---spring_training%1:28:00:: .
Moritz---person%1:03:00:: was bothered during the first two games---game%1:04:03:: this year---year%1:28:01:: by a pulled muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: in the thigh---thigh%1:08:00:: of his right ( kicking ) leg---leg%1:08:01:: and , as a result---result%1:11:00:: , several of his successful conversions---conversion%1:04:02:: have gone barely far enough .
Moritz---person%1:03:00:: said Monday---monday%1:28:00:: his leg---leg%1:08:01:: feels fine and , as a result---result%1:11:00:: , he hopes to start practicing field goals---field_goal%1:04:00:: this week---week%1:28:00:: .
He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School---group%1:03:00:: , including one that beat Anson---group%1:03:00:: , 3 - 0 , in a 1953 district---district%1:15:00:: game---game%1:04:03:: .
`` I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries---try%1:04:00:: during three years---year%1:28:01:: in high school---high_school%1:14:00:: '' , he said , `` and made 26 in a row at one time---time%1:11:00:: .
I never did miss one in a playoff game---playoff_game%1:04:00:: - I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games---playoff_game%1:04:00:: my last two years---year%1:28:01:: '' .
Moritz---person%1:03:00:: came to Texas---texas%1:15:00:: in 1954 but his freshman---freshman%1:18:00:: football---football%1:04:00:: efforts---effort%1:04:00:: were hampered by a knee---knee%1:08:00:: injury---injury%1:26:00:: .
He missed the 1955 season---season%1:28:02:: because of an operation---operation%1:04:00:: on the ailing knee---knee%1:08:00:: , then played 77 minutes---minute%1:28:00:: in 1956 .
His statistical record---record%1:23:00:: that year---year%1:28:01:: , when Texas---group%1:03:00:: won only one game---game%1:04:03:: and lost nine , was far from impressive : he carried the ball---ball%1:06:01:: three times---time%1:11:00:: for a net gain---gain%1:07:01:: of 10 yards---yard%1:23:00:: , punted once for 39 yards---yard%1:23:00:: and caught one pass---pass%1:04:04:: for 13 yards---yard%1:23:00:: .
He went into the Army---group%1:03:00:: in March---march%1:28:00:: , 1957 , and returned two years---year%1:28:01:: later .
But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season---season%1:28:02:: .
Place kicking---place%1:04:00:: is largely a matter---matter%1:09:01:: of timing---timing%1:07:00:: , Moritz---person%1:03:00:: declared .
`` Once you get the feel---feel%1:09:00:: of it , there 's not much to it .
I 've tried to teach some of the other boys---boy%1:18:00:: to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel---feel%1:09:00:: .
Practice---practice%1:04:02:: helps you to get your timing---timing%1:07:00:: down .
`` It 's kind of like golf---golf%1:04:00:: - if you do n't swing a club---club%1:06:01:: very often , your timing---timing%1:07:00:: gets off '' .
Moritz---person%1:03:00:: , however , kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session---practice_session%1:04:00:: .
`` If you kick too much , your leg---leg%1:08:01:: gets kinda dead '' , he explained .
In their first three games---game%1:04:03:: , the Longhorns---group%1:03:00:: have had the ball---ball%1:06:01:: 41 times---time%1:11:00:: and scored 16 times---time%1:11:00:: , or 40 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: their total---total%1:06:00:: passing---passing%1:04:03:: yardage---yardage%1:07:00:: in three games---game%1:04:03:: , 447 on 30 completions---completion%1:04:02:: in 56 attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: , is only 22 yards---yard%1:23:00:: short of their total---total%1:06:00:: passing---passing%1:04:03:: yardage---yardage%1:07:00:: in 1959 , when they made 469 on 37 completions---completion%1:04:02:: in 86 tries---try%1:04:00:: .
Tailback---tailback%1:18:00:: James Saxton---person%1:03:00:: already has surpassed his rushing---rushing%1:04:00:: total---total%1:06:00:: for his brilliant sophomore---sophomore%1:18:00:: season---season%1:28:02:: , when he netted 271 yards---yard%1:23:00:: on 55 carries---carry%1:04:00:: ; he now has 273 yards---yard%1:23:00:: in 22 tries---try%1:04:00:: during three games---game%1:04:03:: .
Saxton---person%1:03:00:: has made only one second-half---second_half%1:28:00:: appearance---appearance%1:11:00:: this season---season%1:28:02:: and that was in the Washington State---group%1:03:00:: game---game%1:04:03:: , for four plays---play%1:04:05:: : he returned the kickoff---kickoff%1:04:00:: 30 yards---yard%1:23:00:: , gained five yards---yard%1:23:00:: through the line---line%1:14:01:: and then uncorked a 56 - yard---yard%1:23:00:: touchdown---touchdown%1:04:00:: run---run%1:04:02:: before retiring to the bench .
Wingback---wingback%1:18:00:: Jack Collins---person%1:03:00:: injured a knee---knee%1:08:00:: in the Washington State---group%1:03:00:: game---game%1:04:03:: but insists he 'll be ready for Oklahoma---group%1:03:00:: .
Last week---week%1:28:00:: , when Royal---person%1:03:00:: was informed that three Longhorns---group%1:03:00:: were among the conference---conference%1:14:01:: 's top four in rushing---rushing%1:04:00:: , he said : `` That won't last long '' .
It did n't ; Monday---monday%1:28:00:: , he had four Longhorns---group%1:03:00:: in the top four .
A good feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: prevailed on the SMU---group%1:03:00:: coaching staff---staff%1:14:00:: Monday---monday%1:28:00:: , but attention---attention%1:09:00:: quickly turned from Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: 's victory---victory%1:11:00:: to next week---week%1:28:00:: 's problem---problem%1:26:00:: : Rice University---group%1:03:00:: .
The Mustangs---group%1:03:00:: do n't play this week---week%1:28:00:: .
`` We 're just real happy for the players---player%1:18:01:: '' , Coach---coach%1:18:01:: Bill Meek---person%1:03:00:: said of the 9 - 7 victory---victory%1:11:00:: over the Air Force Academy---group%1:03:00:: .
`` I think the big thing---thing%1:09:02:: about the game---game%1:04:03:: was that our kids---kid%1:18:00:: for the third straight week---week%1:28:00:: stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: on .
It was the first time---time%1:11:00:: we 've been ahead this season---season%1:28:02:: ( when John Richey---person%1:03:00:: kicked what proved to be the winning field goal---field_goal%1:04:00:: ) '' .
Assistant---assistant%1:18:00:: coach---coach%1:18:01:: John Cudmore---person%1:03:00:: described victory---victory%1:11:00:: as `` a good feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: , I think , on the part---part%1:09:02:: of the coaches---coach%1:18:01:: and the players---player%1:18:01:: .
Meek---person%1:03:00:: expressed particular gratification---gratification%1:26:00:: at the defensive performances---performance%1:04:00:: of end---end%1:18:00:: Happy Nelson---person%1:03:00:: and halfback---halfback%1:18:00:: Billy Gannon---person%1:03:00:: .
Both turned in top jobs---job%1:04:01:: for the second straight game---game%1:04:03:: .
`` Nelson---person%1:03:00:: played magnificent football---football%1:04:00:: '' , Meek---person%1:03:00:: praised .
`` He knocked down the interference---interference%1:04:01:: and made key stops---stop%1:04:00:: lots of times---time%1:11:00:: .
And he caused the fumble---fumble%1:04:00:: that set up our touchdown---touchdown%1:04:00:: .
He broke that boy---boy%1:18:00:: ( Air Force---group%1:03:00:: fullback---fullback%1:18:00:: Nick Arshinkoff---person%1:03:00:: ) in two and knocked him loose from the football---football%1:06:00:: '' .
Gannon---person%1:03:00:: contributed saving plays---play%1:04:04:: on the Falcons---group%1:03:00:: ' aerial thrusts---thrust%1:04:00:: in the late stages---stage%1:28:00:: .
Gannon contributed saving plays---play%1:04:05:: on the Falcons ' aerial thrusts in the late stages .
One was on a fourth down---down%1:04:00:: screen pass---screen_pass%1:04:00:: from the Mustang---group%1:03:00:: 21 after an incomplete pass---pass%1:04:04:: into Gannon---person%1:03:00:: 's territory---territory%1:15:00:: .
`` As soon as it started to form , Gannon---person%1:03:00:: spotted it '' , Meek---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy---boy%1:18:00:: ( halfback---halfback%1:18:00:: Terry Isaacson---person%1:03:00:: ) had time---time%1:28:05:: to turn around .
He nailed it for a yard---yard%1:23:00:: loss---loss%1:21:01:: '' .
The Air Force's---group%1:03:00:: , and the game---game%1:04:03:: 's , final play---play%1:04:05:: , was a long pass---pass%1:04:02:: by quarterback---quarterback%1:18:00:: Bob McNaughton---person%1:03:00:: which Gannon---person%1:03:00:: intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards---yard%1:23:00:: .
`` He just lay back there and waited for it '' , Meek---person%1:03:00:: said .
Except for sophomore---sophomore%1:18:00:: center---center%1:18:00:: Mike Kelsey---person%1:03:00:: and fullback---fullback%1:18:00:: Mike Rice---person%1:03:00:: , Meek---person%1:03:00:: expects the squad---squad%1:14:00:: to be physically sound for Rice---group%1:03:00:: .
`` Kelsey---person%1:03:00:: is very doubtful for the Rice---group%1:03:00:: game---game%1:04:03:: '' , Meek---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` He 'll be out of action all this week---week%1:28:00:: .
He got hit from the blind side---side%1:08:00:: by the split end---split_end%1:18:00:: coming back on the second play---play%1:04:05:: of the game---game%1:04:03:: .
There is definitely some ligament---ligament%1:08:00:: damage---damage%1:11:00:: in his knee---knee%1:08:00:: '' .
Rice---person%1:03:00:: has not played since injuring a knee---knee%1:08:00:: in the opener---opener%1:11:00:: with Maryland---group%1:03:00:: .
`` He 's looking a lot better , and he 's able to run '' , Meek---person%1:03:00:: explained .
`` We 'll let him do a lot of running---running%1:04:01:: this week---week%1:28:00:: , but I do n't know if he 'll be able to play '' .
The game---game%1:04:03:: players---player%1:18:01:: saw the Air Force---group%1:03:00:: film---film%1:10:01:: Monday---monday%1:28:00:: , ran for 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: , then went in , while the reserves---reserve%1:18:00:: scrimmaged for 45 minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
`` We 'll work hard Tuesday---tuesday%1:28:00:: , Wednesday---wednesday%1:28:00:: and Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: '' , Meek---person%1:03:00:: said , `` and probably will have a good scrimmage---scrimmage%1:04:01:: Friday---friday%1:28:00:: .

The Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: Texans---group%1:03:00:: were back home Monday---monday%1:28:00:: with their third victory---victory%1:11:00:: in four American Football League---group%1:03:00:: starts---start%1:11:00:: - a 19 - 12 triumph---triumph%1:11:00:: over the Denver Broncos---group%1:03:00:: - but their visit---visit%1:14:00:: will be a short one .
The Texans---group%1:03:00:: have two more road games---road_game%1:04:00:: - at Buffalo---location%1:03:00:: and Houston---houston%1:15:00:: - before they play for the home folks again , and it looks as if coach---coach%1:18:01:: Hank Stram---person%1:03:00:: 's men---men%1:14:00:: will meet the Bills---group%1:03:00:: just as they are developing into the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of team---team%1:14:00:: they were expected to be in pre-season---preseason%1:28:00:: reckonings---reckoning%1:09:00:: .
Buffalo---location%1:03:00:: coach---coach%1:18:01:: Buster Ramsey---person%1:03:00:: , who has become one of the game---game%1:04:03:: 's greatest collectors---collector%1:18:00:: of quarterbacks---quarterback%1:18:00:: , apparently now has found a productive pair---pair%1:14:00:: in two ex National Football Leaguers---group%1:03:00:: , M. C. Reynolds---person%1:03:00:: and Warren Rabb---person%1:03:00:: .
Rabb---person%1:03:00:: , the former Louisiana State---group%1:03:00:: field general---field_general%1:18:00:: , came off the bench for his debut---debut%1:04:00:: with the Bills---group%1:03:00:: Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: and directed his new team---team%1:14:00:: to a 22 - 12 upset victory---victory%1:11:00:: over the Houston Oilers---group%1:03:00:: , defending league---league%1:14:01:: champions---champion%1:18:01:: .
`` Just our luck---luck%1:19:00:: '' ! exclaimed Stram---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Buster---person%1:03:00:: would solve that quarterback---quarterback%1:18:00:: problem---problem%1:26:00:: just as we head that way---way%1:15:00:: '' .
Ramsey---person%1:03:00:: has a thing---thing%1:10:00:: or two to mutter about himself , for the Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: defensive unit---unit%1:14:00:: turned in another splendid effort---effort%1:04:00:: against Denver---denver%1:15:00:: , and the Texans---group%1:03:00:: were able to whip the dangerous Broncs---group%1:03:00:: without the fullbacking of a top star---star%1:18:01:: , Jack Spikes---person%1:03:00:: , though he did the team---team%1:14:00:: 's place-kicking---place-kicking%1:04:00:: while nursing a knee---knee%1:08:00:: injury---injury%1:11:00:: .
`` Our interior line---line%1:14:01:: and our linebackers---linebacker%1:18:00:: played exceptionally well '' , said Stram Monday---person%1:03:00:: after he and his staff---staff%1:14:01:: reviewed movies---movie%1:10:00:: of the game---game%1:04:03:: .
`` In fact our whole defensive unit---unit%1:14:00:: did a good job---job%1:04:01:: '' .
The Texans---group%1:03:00:: won the game---game%1:04:03:: through ball---ball%1:06:01:: control---control%1:04:00:: , with Quarterback---quarterback%1:18:00:: Cotton Davidson---person%1:03:00:: throwing only 17 passes---pass%1:04:04:: .
`` We always like to keep the ball---ball%1:06:01:: as much as we can against Denver---denver%1:15:00:: because they have such an explosive attack---attack%1:04:00:: '' , explained Stram---person%1:03:00:: .
`` They can be going along , doing little damage---damage%1:11:00:: , then bang , bang - they can hit a couple of passes---pass%1:04:02:: on you for touchdowns---touchdown%1:04:00:: and put you in trouble '' .
The Broncs---group%1:03:00:: did hit two quick strikes---strike%1:04:02:: in the final period---final_period%1:28:00:: against the Texans---group%1:03:00:: , but Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: had enough of a lead---lead%1:07:02:: to hold them off .
The principal tactic---tactic%1:09:00:: in controlling the ball---ball%1:06:01:: was giving it to Abner Haynes---person%1:03:00:: , the flashy halfback---halfback%1:18:00:: .
He was called upon 26 times---time%1:11:00:: - more than all of the other ball---ball%1:06:01:: carriers---carrier%1:18:03:: combined - and delivered 145 yards---yard%1:23:00:: .
The Texans---group%1:03:00:: made themselves a comforting break---break%1:11:01:: on the opening kickoff---kickoff%1:04:00:: when Denver---denver%1:15:00:: 's Al Carmichael---person%1:03:00:: was jarred loose from the ball---ball%1:06:01:: when Dave Grayson---person%1:03:00:: , the speedy halfback---halfback%1:18:00:: , hit him and Guard---guard%1:18:01:: Al Reynolds---person%1:03:00:: claimed it for Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: .
A quick touchdown---touchdown%1:04:00:: resulted .
`` That permitted us to start controlling the ball---ball%1:06:01:: right away '' , said Stram---person%1:03:00:: , quipping , `` I think I 'll put that play---play%1:04:05:: in the book---book%1:06:00:: '' .

Then Kerr---person%1:03:00:: , a graduate student---graduate_student%1:18:00:: from Illinois---illinois%1:15:00:: , moved past him on a straightaway---straightaway%1:06:00:: and held off Mills---person%1:03:00:: 's challenge---challenge%1:26:00:: on the final turn---turn%1:25:00:: .
Mills---person%1:03:00:: was timed in 1.10.4 .
The crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: at the twenty-first annual K. of C. Games , final indoor meet---meet%1:11:00:: of the season---season%1:28:02:: , got a thrill---thrill%1:12:00:: a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: earlier when a slender , bespectacled woman---woman%1:18:00:: broke the one week---week%1:28:00:: old world record---world_record%1:04:00:: in the half-mile---half_mile%1:23:00:: run---run%1:11:02:: .
Mrs. Grace Butcher---person%1:03:00:: , of nearby Chardon---location%1:03:00:: , a 27 - year---year%1:28:01:: old housewife---housewife%1:18:00:: who has two children---child%1:18:01:: , finished in 2.21.6 .
She snapped five tenths---tenth%1:23:00:: of a second off the mark---mark%1:09:01:: set by Helen Shipley---person%1:03:00:: , of Wellsley College---group%1:03:00:: , in the National A.A.U. meet---meet%1:11:00:: in Columbus---columbus%1:15:00:: , Ohio---ohio%1:15:00:: .
Bobby Waters---person%1:03:00:: of Sylvania---location%1:03:00:: , Ga.---location%1:03:00:: , relief---relief%1:18:00:: quarterback---quarterback%1:18:00:: for the San Francisco---san_francisco%1:15:00:: 49ers---group%1:03:00:: of the National Football League---group%1:03:00:: , will undergo a knee---knee%1:08:00:: operation---operation%1:04:00:: tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:01:: at Franklin Hospital---group%1:03:00:: here .
Waters---person%1:03:00:: injured his left knee---knee%1:08:00:: in the last game---game%1:04:01:: of the 1960 season---season%1:28:02:: .
While working out in Sylvania---location%1:03:00:: a swelling---swelling%1:26:00:: developed in the knee---knee%1:08:00:: and he came here to consult the team---team%1:14:00:: physician---physician%1:18:00:: .
Two errors---error%1:04:03:: by New York---new_york%1:15:01:: Yankee---group%1:03:00:: shortstop---shortstop%1:18:00:: Tony Kubek---person%1:03:00:: in the eleventh inning---inning%1:28:00:: donated four unearned runs---unearned_run%1:04:00:: and a 5 - to 2 victory---victory%1:11:00:: to the Chicago White Sox today---today%1:28:00:: .
Color---color%1:07:00:: was delayed until 1935 , the wide screen---wide_screen%1:06:00:: until the early fifties---fifties%1:28:01:: .
Movement---movement%1:19:00:: itself was the chief and often the only attraction---attraction%1:09:00:: of the primitive movies---movie%1:10:00:: of the nineties---nineties%1:28:02:: .
Each film---film%1:10:01:: consisted of fifty feet---foot%1:23:00:: , which gives a running time---running_time%1:28:00:: of about one minute---minute%1:28:00:: on the screen---screen%1:06:06:: .
As long as audiences---audience%1:14:00:: came to see the movement---movement%1:19:00:: , there seemed little reason---reason%1:16:00:: to adventure further .
Motion-picture---motion_picture%1:10:00:: exhibitions---exhibition%1:04:00:: took place in stores---store%1:06:00:: in a general atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: like that of the penny arcade---penny_arcade%1:06:00:: which can still be found in such urban areas---urban_area%1:15:00:: as Times Square---location%1:03:00:: .
Brief snips---snip%1:06:00:: of actual events---event%1:03:00:: were shown : parades---parade%1:14:00:: , dances---dance%1:14:00:: , street---street%1:06:00:: scenes---scene%1:26:00:: .
The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity---popularity%1:07:00:: :
a train---train%1:06:00:: rushes straight at the audience---audience%1:14:00:: , or a great wave---wave%1:11:01:: threatens to break over the seats---seat%1:15:01:: .
An early Edison---person%1:03:00:: production---production%1:10:00:: was The Execution of Mary Queen of Scotts .
The unfortunate queen---queen%1:18:00:: mounted the scaffold---scaffold%1:06:01:: ; the headsman---headsman%1:18:00:: swung his axe---axe%1:06:00:: ; the head---head%1:08:00:: dropped off ; end---end%1:11:00:: of film---film%1:10:01:: .
An early film---film%1:10:01:: by a competitor---competitor%1:18:00:: of the Wizard---wizard%1:18:01:: of Menlo Park---location%1:03:00:: simply showed a long kiss---kiss%1:04:00:: performed by two actors---actor%1:18:00:: of the contemporary stage---stage%1:10:00:: .
In the field---field%1:04:00:: of entertainment---entertainment%1:04:00:: there is no spur---spur%1:10:00:: to financial daring---daring%1:07:00:: so effective as audience---audience%1:14:00:: boredom---boredom%1:12:00:: , and the first decade---decade%1:28:00:: of the new device---device%1:06:00:: was not over before audiences---audience%1:14:00:: began staying away in large numbers---large_number%1:23:00:: from the simple-minded , one minute---minute%1:28:00:: shows---show%1:04:00:: .
In response---response%1:19:00:: , the industry---industry%1:14:00:: allowed the discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: of the motion picture---motion_picture%1:10:00:: as a form---form%1:09:01:: of fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: and thus gave the movies---movie%1:10:00:: the essential form---form%1:09:00:: they have had to this day---day%1:28:03:: .
Despite the sheer beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: and spectacle---spectacle%1:10:00:: of numerous documentaries---documentary%1:10:00:: , art---art%1:06:00:: films---film%1:10:01:: , and travelogues---travelogue%1:10:00:: , despite the impressive financial success---success%1:04:00:: of such a recent development---development%1:11:01:: as Cinerama , the movies---movie%1:10:00:: are at heart a form---form%1:09:01:: of fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: , like the play---play%1:10:01:: , the novel---novel%1:10:00:: , or the short story---short_story%1:10:00:: .
Moreover , the most artistically successful of the nonfiction---nonfiction%1:10:00:: films---film%1:10:01:: have invariably borrowed the narrative---narrative%1:10:00:: form---form%1:09:00:: from the fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: feature---feature%1:10:00:: .
Thus such great American documentaries---documentary%1:10:00:: as The River and The Plow That Broke the Plains were composed as visual stories---story%1:10:03:: rather than as illustrated lectures---lecture%1:10:00:: .
The discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: that movies---movie%1:10:00:: are a form---form%1:09:01:: of fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: was made in the early years---year%1:28:01:: of this century---century%1:28:00:: and it was made chiefly by two men---man%1:18:00:: , a French magician---magician%1:18:01:: , Georges Melies---person%1:03:00:: , and an American employee---employee%1:18:00:: of Edison---person%1:03:00:: , Edwin S. Porter---person%1:03:00:: .
Of the two , Porter---person%1:03:00:: is justly the better known , for he went far beyond the vital finding---finding%1:04:00:: of fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: for films---film%1:10:01:: to take the first step---first_step%1:04:00:: toward fashioning a language---language%1:10:00:: of film---film%1:10:00:: , toward making the motion picture---motion_picture%1:10:00:: the intricate , efficient time machine---time_machine%1:06:00:: that it has remained since , even in the most inept hands---hands%1:04:00:: .
Melies---person%1:03:00:: , however , out of his professional instincts---instinct%1:09:00:: as a magician---magician%1:18:01:: , discovered and made use---use%1:04:00:: of a number---number%1:07:00:: of illusionary techniques---technique%1:09:00:: that remain part---part%1:24:00:: of the vocabulary---vocabulary%1:09:01:: of film---film%1:10:00:: .
One of these is the `` dissolve---dissolve%1:10:00:: '' , which makes possible a visually smooth transition---transition%1:04:00:: from scene---scene%1:10:01:: to scene---scene%1:10:01:: .
As the first scene---scene%1:10:01:: begins to fade , the succeeding scene---scene%1:10:01:: begins to appear .
For a moment---moment%1:28:01:: or two , both scenes---scene%1:10:01:: are present simultaneously , one growing weaker , one growing stronger .
In a series---series%1:10:01:: of fairy tales---fairytale%1:10:00:: and fantasies---fantasy%1:10:00:: , Melies---person%1:03:00:: demonstrated that the film---film%1:10:00:: is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story---story%1:10:03:: , with beginning---beginning%1:09:00:: , middle---middle%1:09:00:: and end---end%1:09:00:: , complications---complication%1:04:00:: , resolutions---resolution%1:04:01:: , climaxes---climax%1:10:00:: , and conclusions---conclusion%1:04:00:: .
Immediately , the film---film%1:10:00:: improved and it improved because in narrative---narrative%1:10:00:: it found a content---content%1:10:00:: based on time---time%1:03:00:: to complement its own unbreakable connection---connection%1:26:00:: with time---time%1:03:00:: .
Physically , a movie---movie%1:10:00:: is possible because a series---series%1:14:00:: of images---image%1:06:00:: is projected one---one%1:23:00:: at a time at such a speed---speed%1:07:00:: that the eye---eye%1:08:00:: `` remembers '' the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing .
Linking the smoothly changing images---image%1:06:00:: together , the eye---eye%1:08:00:: itself endows them with the illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: of movement---movement%1:19:00:: .
The `` projection---projection%1:10:00:: '' time---time%1:28:05:: of painting---painting%1:06:00:: and sculpture---sculpture%1:06:00:: is highly subjective , varying from person---person%1:03:00:: to person---person%1:03:00:: and even varying for a given person---person%1:03:00:: on different occasions---occasion%1:11:00:: .
So is the time---time%1:28:05:: of the novel---novel%1:10:00:: .
The drama---drama%1:10:01:: in the theater---theater%1:06:00:: and the concert---concert%1:10:00:: in the hall---hall%1:06:02:: both have a fixed time---time%1:28:05:: , but the time---time%1:28:05:: is fixed by the director---director%1:18:02:: and the players---player%1:18:00:: , the conductor---conductor%1:18:00:: and the instrumentalists---instrumentalist%1:18:00:: , subject , therefore , to much variation---variation%1:04:00:: , as record---record%1:06:00:: collectors---collector%1:18:01:: well know .
The time---time%1:28:05:: of the motion picture---motion_picture%1:10:00:: is fixed absolutely .
The film---film%1:10:01:: consists of a series---series%1:14:00:: of still , transparent photographs---photograph%1:06:00:: , or `` frames---frame%1:06:03:: '' , 35 - mm.---mm%1:23:00:: - wide .
Each frame---frame%1:06:03:: comes between the light---light%1:06:00:: and the lens---lens%1:06:00:: and is individually projected on the screen---screen%1:06:06:: , at the rate---rate%1:28:00:: , for silent movies---silent_movie%1:10:00:: , of 16 frames---frame%1:06:03:: per second---second%1:28:00:: , and , for sound films---film%1:10:01:: , 24 frames---frame%1:06:03:: per second---second%1:28:00:: .
This is the rate---rate%1:28:00:: of projection---projection%1:10:00:: ; it is also the rate---rate%1:28:00:: of photographing .
Time---time%1:28:05:: is built into the motion picture---motion_picture%1:10:00:: , which cannot exist without time---time%1:03:00:: .
Now time---time%1:03:00:: is also the concern---concern%1:09:00:: of the fictional narrative---narrative%1:10:00:: , which is , at its simplest , the story---story%1:10:03:: of an action---action%1:04:02:: with , usually , a beginning---beginning%1:09:00:: , a middle---middle%1:28:00:: , and an end---end%1:09:00:: - elements---element%1:09:00:: which demand time---time%1:03:00:: as the first condition---condition%1:10:01:: for their existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
The `` moving '' picture---picture%1:06:00:: of the train---train%1:06:00:: or the wave---wave%1:11:01:: coming at the audience---audience%1:14:00:: is , to be sure , more intense than a still picture---picture%1:06:00:: of the same subject---subject%1:06:00:: , but the difference---difference%1:07:00:: is really one of degree---degree%1:07:00:: ; the cinematic element---element%1:06:00:: of time---time%1:03:00:: is merely used to increase the realism of an object---object%1:03:00:: which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo---photo%1:06:00:: .
In narrative---narrative%1:10:00:: , time---time%1:03:00:: is essential , as it is in film---film%1:10:00:: .
Almost everything about the movies---movie%1:10:00:: that is peculiarly of the movies---movie%1:10:00:: derives from a tension---tension%1:26:02:: created and maintained between narrative time---time%1:28:05:: and film---film%1:10:00:: time---time%1:28:05:: .
This discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: of Melies---person%1:03:00:: was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling , magician---magician%1:18:01:: 's tricks---trick%1:04:02:: produced on film---film%1:06:01:: .
It was Porter---person%1:03:00:: , however , who produced the very first movie---movie%1:10:00:: whose name---name%1:10:00:: has lived on through the half century---century%1:28:00:: of film---film%1:10:00:: history---history%1:28:00:: that has since ensued .
The movie---movie%1:10:00:: was The Great Train Robbery and its effects---effect%1:19:00:: on the young industry---industry%1:14:00:: and art---art%1:04:00:: were all but incalculable .
Overnight , for one thing , Porter---person%1:03:00:: 's film---film%1:10:01:: multiplied the standard running time---running_time%1:28:00:: of movies---movie%1:10:00:: by ten---ten%1:23:00:: .
The Great Train Robbery is a one reel---reel%1:06:02:: film---film%1:10:01:: .
One reel---reel%1:06:02:: - from eight to twelve minutes---minute%1:28:00:: - became the standard length---length%1:07:01:: from the year---year%1:28:01:: of Robbery , 1903 , until Griffith---person%1:03:00:: shattered that limit---limit%1:28:00:: forever with Birth of a Nation in 1915 .
The reel---reel%1:06:02:: itself became and still is the standard---standard%1:10:00:: of measure for the movies---movie%1:10:00:: .
The material---material%1:10:00:: of the Porter---person%1:03:00:: film---film%1:10:01:: is simplicity---simplicity%1:07:02:: itself ; much of it has continued to be used over the years---year%1:28:01:: and the heart---heart%1:09:01:: of it - good guys---good_guy%1:18:00:: and bad guys---bad_guy%1:18:00:: in the old West---west%1:15:01:: - pretty well dominated television---television%1:10:00:: toward the end---end%1:28:00:: of the 1950's .
A band---band%1:14:01:: of robbers---robber%1:18:01:: enters a railroad station---railroad_station%1:06:00:: , overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator---telegraph_operator%1:18:00:: , holds up the train---train%1:06:00:: and escapes .
A posse---posse%1:14:00:: is formed and pursues the robbers---robber%1:18:01:: , who , having made their escape---escape%1:04:00:: , are whooping it up with some wild , wild women---woman%1:18:00:: in a honky-tonk---honky-tonk%1:06:00:: hide-out---hideout%1:15:00:: .
The robbers---robber%1:18:01:: run from the hide-out---hideout%1:15:00:: , take cover---cover%1:04:00:: in a wooded declivity---declivity%1:17:00:: , and are shot dead by the posse---posse%1:14:00:: .
As a finale is appended a close-up---closeup%1:06:00:: of one of the band---band%1:14:01:: taking aim and firing his revolver---revolver%1:06:00:: straight at the audience---audience%1:14:00:: .
All this is simple enough , but in telling the story---story%1:10:03:: Porter---person%1:03:00:: did two important things---thing%1:04:00:: that had not been done before .
Each scene---scene%1:10:01:: is shot straight through , as had been the universal custom---custom%1:04:00:: , from a camera---camera%1:06:00:: fixed in a single position---position%1:15:00:: , but in the outdoor scenes---scene%1:10:01:: , especially in the capture---capture%1:04:00:: and destruction---destruction%1:04:00:: of the outlaws---outlaw%1:18:00:: , Porter---person%1:03:00:: 's camera---camera%1:06:00:: position---position%1:15:00:: breaks , necessarily , with the camera---camera%1:06:00:: position---position%1:15:00:: standard until then , which had been , roughly , that of a spectator---spectator%1:18:00:: in a center orchestra---orchestra%1:06:00:: seat---seat%1:15:01:: at a play---play%1:10:03:: .
The plane---plane%1:25:00:: of the action---action%1:04:02:: in the scene---scene%1:10:01:: is not parallel with the plane---plane%1:25:00:: of the film---film%1:10:01:: in the camera---camera%1:06:00:: or on the screen---screen%1:06:06:: .
If the change---change%1:11:00:: , at first sight , seems minor , we may recall that it took the Italian painters---painter%1:18:00:: about two hundred years---year%1:28:01:: to make an analogous change---change%1:11:00:: , and the Italian painters---painter%1:18:00:: , by universal consent---consent%1:10:00:: , were the most brilliant group---group%1:03:00:: of geniuses---genius%1:18:01:: any art---art%1:04:00:: has seen .
In that apparently simple shift---shift%1:04:01:: Porter---person%1:03:00:: opened the way---way%1:06:00:: to the sensitive use---use%1:04:00:: of the camera---camera%1:06:00:: as an instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: of art---art%1:04:00:: as well as a mechanical recording---recording%1:04:00:: device---device%1:06:00:: .
He revealed the potential value---value%1:07:00:: of the `` cut---cut%1:10:00:: '' as the basic technique---technique%1:09:00:: in the art---art%1:04:00:: of the film---film%1:10:00:: .
Cutting---cutting%1:04:03:: , of course , takes place automatically in the creation---creation%1:04:00:: of a film---film%1:10:01:: .
The meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: of the word---word%1:10:00:: is quite physical , to begin with .
The physical film---film%1:06:01:: is cut with a knife---knife%1:06:00:: at the end---end%1:15:00:: of one complete sequence---sequence%1:06:00:: , and the cut edge---edge%1:15:00:: is joined physically , by cement---cement%1:27:01:: , to the cut edge---edge%1:15:00:: of the beginning---beginning%1:15:00:: of the next sequence---sequence%1:06:00:: .
If , as a home movie---home_movie%1:10:00:: maker---maker%1:18:00:: , you shoot the inevitable footage---footage%1:06:00:: of your child---child%1:18:01:: taking its first steps---steps%1:17:00:: , you have merely recorded an historical event---event%1:03:00:: .
If , in preparing that shot---shot%1:10:01:: for the inevitable showing---showing%1:10:01:: to your friends---friend%1:18:00:: , you interrupt the sequence---sequence%1:06:00:: to paste in a few frames---frame%1:06:03:: of the child---child%1:18:00:: 's grandmother---grandmother%1:18:00:: watching this event---event%1:03:00:: , you have begun to be an artist---artist%1:18:00:: in film---film%1:10:00:: ; you are employing the basic technique---technique%1:09:00:: of film---film%1:10:00:: ; you are cutting .
This is what Porter---person%1:03:00:: did .
As the robbers---robber%1:18:01:: leave the looted train---train%1:06:00:: , the film---film%1:10:01:: suddenly cuts back to the station---station%1:06:00:: , where the telegrapher---telegrapher%1:18:00:: 's little daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: arrives with her father---father%1:18:00:: 's dinner pail---dinner_pail%1:06:00:: only to find him bound on the floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
She dashes around in alarm---alarm%1:12:00:: .
The two events---event%1:03:00:: are taking place at the same time .
Time---time%1:03:00:: and space---space%1:03:00:: have both become cinematic .
We leap from event---event%1:03:00:: to event---event%1:03:00:: - including the formation---formation%1:04:01:: of the posse---posse%1:14:00:: - even though the events---event%1:03:00:: , in `` reality---reality%1:26:01:: '' are taking place not in sequence---sequence%1:04:00:: but simultaneously , and not near each other but at a considerable distance---distance%1:07:00:: .
The `` chase---chase%1:04:00:: '' as a standard film---film%1:10:00:: device---device%1:10:00:: probably dates from The Great Train Robbery , and there is a reason---reason%1:10:01:: for the continued popularity---popularity%1:07:00:: of the device---device%1:10:00:: .
The chase---chase%1:04:00:: in itself is a narrative---narrative%1:10:00:: ; it presumes both speed---speed%1:07:00:: and urgency---urgency%1:26:00:: and it demands cutting---cutting%1:04:03:: - both from pursued---pursued%1:18:00:: to pursuer---pursuer%1:18:00:: and from stage---stage%1:04:00:: to stage---stage%1:04:00:: of the journey---journey%1:04:00:: of both .
The simple , naked idea---idea%1:09:00:: of one man---man%1:18:00:: chasing another is of its nature---nature%1:07:02:: better fitted for the film---film%1:10:00:: than it is for any other form---form%1:09:01:: of fiction---fiction%1:10:00:: .
The cowboy---cowboy%1:18:00:: films---film%1:10:01:: , the cops---cop%1:18:00:: and robbers---robber%1:18:01:: films---film%1:10:01:: , and the slapstick---slapstick%1:10:00:: comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: films---film%1:10:01:: culminating in an insane chase---chase%1:04:00:: are not only catering to what critics---critic%1:18:00:: may assume to be a vulgar taste---taste%1:12:02:: for violence---violence%1:26:00:: ; these films---film%1:10:01:: and these sequences---sequence%1:04:00:: are also seeking out - instinctively or by design - the peculiarly cinematic elements---element%1:09:00:: of narrative---narrative%1:10:00:: .
There still remained the need---need%1:26:00:: for one great film---film%1:10:00:: artist---artist%1:18:00:: to explore the full potential---potential%1:26:00:: of the new form---form%1:09:01:: and to make it an art---art%1:06:00:: .
The man---man%1:18:00:: was D.W. Griffith---person%1:03:00:: .
When he came to the movies---movie%1:10:00:: - more or less by accident---accident%1:11:00:: - they were still cheap entertainment---entertainment%1:04:00:: capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
In about seven years---year%1:28:01:: Griffith---person%1:03:00:: either invented or first realized the possibilities---possibility%1:09:03:: of virtually every resource---resource%1:21:00:: at the disposal---disposal%1:07:00:: of the film maker---film_maker%1:18:00:: .
Before he was forty Griffith---person%1:03:00:: had created the art---art%1:06:00:: of the film---film%1:10:00:: .
Not that there had not been attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: , mostly European , to do exactly that .
But in general the European efforts---effort%1:04:00:: to make an art---art%1:06:00:: of the entertainment---entertainment%1:04:00:: had ignored the slowly emerging language---language%1:10:00:: of the film---film%1:10:00:: itself .
Staggeringly condensed versions---version%1:10:01:: of famous novels---novel%1:10:00:: and famous plays---play%1:10:01:: were presented .
Great actors---actor%1:18:00:: and actresses---actress%1:18:00:: - the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt---person%1:03:00:: - were hired to repeat their stage---stage%1:10:00:: performances---performance%1:04:01:: before the camera---camera%1:06:00:: .
In all of this extensive and expensive effort---effort%1:04:01:: , the camera---camera%1:06:00:: was downgraded to the status---status%1:26:00:: of recording---recording%1:04:00:: instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: for art work---art%1:10:00:: produced elsewhere by the actor---actor%1:18:00:: or by the author---author%1:18:00:: .
The phonograph---phonograph%1:06:01:: today---today%1:28:00:: , for all its high fidelity---high_fidelity%1:04:00:: and stereophonic sound---sound%1:10:00:: , is precisely what the early art---art%1:06:00:: purveyors---purveyor%1:18:00:: in the movies---movie%1:10:00:: wished to make of the camera---camera%1:06:00:: .
Not surprisingly , this approach---approach%1:04:02:: did not work .
The effort---effort%1:04:00:: produced a valuable record---record%1:10:03:: of stage---stage%1:10:00:: techniques---technique%1:09:00:: in the early years---year%1:28:01:: of the century---century%1:28:00:: and some interesting records---record%1:10:03:: of great theater---theater%1:10:00:: figures---figure%1:18:00:: who would otherwise be only names---name%1:10:00:: .
But no art---art%1:04:00:: at all was born of the art---art%1:06:00:: effort---effort%1:04:02:: in the early movies---movie%1:10:00:: .
The place---place%1:09:00:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: in the simple , preliterate societies---society%1:14:00:: is quite definite ; as a complex it fits into the whole social organization---social_organization%1:14:00:: and functions dominantly in every part---part%1:24:00:: of it .
In societies---society%1:14:00:: like ours , however , its place---place%1:09:00:: is less clear and more complex .
With the diversity---diversity%1:07:02:: of religious viewpoints---viewpoint%1:09:00:: , there are differences of opinion---difference_of_opinion%1:10:00:: as to the essential features---feature%1:09:00:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: ; and there are different opinions---opinion%1:09:00:: as to the essential functions---function%1:07:00:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: .
Nevertheless , for most of the population---population%1:14:00:: of heterogeneous advanced societies---society%1:14:00:: , though less for the less religious portion---portion%1:24:00:: , religion---religion%1:09:00:: does perform certain modal individual and social functions---function%1:07:00:: .
Although the inner functions---function%1:07:00:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: are not of direct significance---significance%1:07:00:: in social organization---social_organization%1:14:00:: , they have important indirect consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: .
If the inner functions---function%1:07:00:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: are performed , the individual---individual%1:03:00:: is a composed , ordered , motivated , and emotionally secure associate---associate%1:18:00:: ; he is not greatly frustrated , and he is not anomic ; he is better fitted to perform his social life---life%1:26:01:: among his fellows---fellow%1:18:02:: .
There are several closely related inner functions---function%1:07:00:: .
In the last analysis , religion---religion%1:09:00:: is the means---means%1:06:00:: of inducing , formulating , expressing , enhancing , implementing , and perpetuating man 's deepest experience---experience%1:09:00:: - the religious .
Man is first religious ; the instrumentalities---instrumentality%1:07:00:: follow .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: seeks to satisfy human needs---need%1:17:00:: of great pertinence---pertinence%1:24:00:: .
The significant things---thing%1:09:02:: in it , at the higher religious levels---level%1:26:01:: , are the inner emotional , mental , and spiritual occurrences---occurrence%1:11:00:: that fill the pressing human needs---need%1:17:00:: of self-preservation---self-preservation%1:04:00:: , self---self%1:09:00:: pacification---pacification%1:04:00:: , and self---self%1:09:00:: completion .
The chief experience---experience%1:09:00:: is the sensing---sensing%1:09:00:: of communion---communion%1:04:01:: , and in the higher religions---religion%1:09:00:: , of a harmonious relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: with the supernatural power---power%1:18:00:: .
Related to this is the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that most of the higher religions---religion%1:09:00:: define for the individual---individual%1:03:00:: his place---place%1:09:00:: in the universe---universe%1:17:00:: and give him a feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: that he is relatively secure in an ordered , dependable universe---universe%1:17:00:: .
Man has the experience---experience%1:09:00:: of being helpfully allied with what he cannot fully understand ; he is a coordinate part---part%1:24:00:: of all of the mysterious energy---energy%1:07:00:: and being---being%1:26:00:: and movement---movement%1:11:00:: .
The universe---universe%1:17:00:: is a safe and permanent home---home%1:06:00:: .
A number---number%1:07:00:: of religions---religion%1:09:00:: also satisfy for many the need---need%1:26:00:: of being linked with the ultimate and eternal .
Death---death%1:19:00:: is not permanent defeat---defeat%1:11:00:: and disappearance---disappearance%1:11:00:: ; man---man%1:05:01:: has a second chance---chance%1:26:00:: .
He is not lost in the abyss---abyss%1:17:00:: of endless time---time%1:03:00:: ; he has endless being---being%1:26:00:: .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: at its best also offers the experience---experience%1:09:00:: of spiritual fulfillment---fulfillment%1:12:00:: by inviting man into the highest realm---realm%1:26:01:: of the spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: can summate , epitomize , relate , and conserve all the highest ideals---ideal%1:09:00:: and values---values%1:09:00:: - ethical , aesthetic , and religious - of man formed in his culture---culture%1:14:00:: .
There is also the possibility---possibility%1:09:03:: , among higher religions---religion%1:09:00:: , of experiencing consistent meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: in life---life%1:09:00:: and enjoying guidance---guidance%1:10:00:: and expansiveness---expansiveness%1:07:01:: .
The kind---kind%1:09:00:: of religious experience---experience%1:09:00:: that most moderns---modern%1:18:00:: seek not only provides , clarifies , and relates human yearnings---yearning%1:12:00:: , values---values%1:09:00:: , ideals---ideal%1:09:00:: , and purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: ; it also provides facilities---facility%1:06:00:: and incitements---incitement%1:10:01:: for the development---development%1:22:02:: of personality---personality%1:07:00:: , sociality---sociality%1:07:00:: , and creativeness---creativeness%1:09:00:: .
Under the religious impulse---impulse%1:16:00:: , whether theistic or humanistic , men have joy---joy%1:12:00:: in living ; life---life%1:09:00:: leads somewhere .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: at its best is out in front , ever beckoning and leading on , and , as Lippman---person%1:03:00:: put it , `` mobilizing all man 's scattered energies---energy%1:19:00:: in one triumphant sense of his own infinite importance---importance%1:07:00:: '' .
At the same time that religion---religion%1:09:00:: binds the individual---individual%1:03:00:: helpfully to the supernatural---supernatural%1:18:00:: and gives him cosmic peace---peace%1:12:00:: and a sense---sense%1:09:05:: of supreme fulfillment---fulfillment%1:12:00:: , it also has great therapeutic value---value%1:07:00:: for him .
It gives him aid---aid%1:04:00:: , comfort---comfort%1:04:00:: , even solace---solace%1:12:00:: , in meeting mundane life---life%1:09:00:: situations---situation%1:26:00:: where his own unassisted practical knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: and skill---skill%1:09:00:: are felt by him to be inadequate .
He is confronted with the recurrent crises---crisis%1:26:00:: , such as great natural catastrophes---catastrophe%1:11:00:: and the great transitions---transition%1:04:00:: of life---life%1:28:00:: - marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: , incurable disease---disease%1:26:00:: , widowhood---widowhood%1:28:00:: , old age---old_age%1:28:00:: , the certainty---certainty%1:07:00:: of death---death%1:28:00:: .
He has to cope with frustration---frustration%1:12:00:: and other emotional disturbance---emotional_disturbance%1:26:00:: and anomie---anomie%1:26:00:: .
His religious beliefs---religious_belief%1:09:00:: provide him with plausible explanations---explanation%1:10:00:: for many conditions---condition%1:09:00:: which cause him great concern---concern%1:12:01:: , and his religious faith---faith%1:09:00:: makes possible fortitude---fortitude%1:07:00:: , equanimity---equanimity%1:07:00:: , and consolation---consolation%1:12:00:: , enabling him to endure colossal misfortune---misfortune%1:11:00:: , fear , frustration---frustration%1:12:00:: , uncertainty---uncertainty%1:09:00:: , suffering---suffering%1:26:01:: , evil---evil%1:04:00:: , and danger---danger%1:04:00:: .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: usually also includes a principle---principle%1:09:01:: of compensation---compensation%1:21:00:: , mainly in a promised perfect future state---state%1:03:00:: .
The belief---belief%1:09:00:: in immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: , where held , functions as a redress---redress%1:21:00:: for the ills and disappointments---disappointment%1:12:00:: of the here and now---here_and_now%1:28:00:: .
The tensions---tension%1:26:01:: accompanying a repressive consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: of wrongdoing---wrongdoing%1:07:00:: or sinning---sinning%1:04:00:: or some tormenting secret---secret%1:10:00:: are relieved for the less self-contained or self-sufficient by confession---confession%1:10:00:: , repentance---repentance%1:12:00:: , and penance---penance%1:12:00:: .
The feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: of individual inferiority---inferiority%1:07:00:: , defeat---defeat%1:12:00:: , or humilation---humiliation%1:26:00:: growing out of various social situations---situation%1:26:00:: or individual deficiencies---deficiency%1:26:00:: or failures---failure%1:11:00:: is compensated for by communion---communion%1:04:01:: in worship---worship%1:04:00:: or prayer---prayer%1:04:00:: with a friendly , but all-victorious Father-God---father-god%1:18:00:: , as well as by sympathetic fellowship---fellowship%1:14:00:: with others who share this faith---faith%1:09:00:: , and by opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: in religious acts---act%1:03:00:: for giving vent to emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: and energies---energy%1:07:00:: .
In providing for these inner individual functions---function%1:07:00:: , religion---religion%1:09:00:: undertakes in behalf---behalf%1:07:00:: of individual peace of mind---peace_of_mind%1:12:00:: and well-being---well-being%1:26:00:: services---service%1:04:08:: for which there is no other institution---institution%1:14:00:: .
In addition to the functions---function%1:07:00:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: within man---man%1:05:01:: , there have always been the outer social functions---function%1:07:00:: for the community---community%1:14:00:: and society---society%1:14:00:: .
The two---two%1:23:00:: have never been separable .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: is vitally necessary in both societal maintenance---maintenance%1:21:00:: and regulation---regulation%1:10:00:: .
The value-system---value-system%1:09:00:: of a community---community%1:14:00:: or society---society%1:14:00:: is always correlated with , and to a degree---degree%1:07:00:: dependent upon , a more or less shared system---system%1:09:02:: of religious beliefs---religious_belief%1:09:00:: and convictions---conviction%1:09:00:: .
The religion---religion%1:09:00:: supports , re-enforces , reaffirms , and maintains the fundamental values---values%1:09:00:: .
Even in the united states---united_states%1:15:00:: , with its freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: of religious belief---religious_belief%1:09:00:: and worship---worship%1:04:00:: and its vast denominational differentiation---differentiation%1:09:00:: , there is a general consensus---consensus%1:26:00:: regarding the basic Christian values---values%1:09:00:: .
This is demonstrated especially when there is awareness---awareness%1:09:00:: of radically different value orientation---value_orientation%1:09:00:: elsewhere ; for example Americans---person%1:03:00:: rally to Christian values---values%1:09:00:: vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism---communism%1:09:00:: .
In America---america%1:15:00:: also all of our major religious bodies---body%1:14:00:: officially sanction a universalistic ethic---ethic%1:09:00:: which is reflective of our common religion---religion%1:09:00:: .
Even the non church members---church_member%1:18:00:: - the freewheelers---freewheeler%1:18:00:: , marginal religionists---religionist%1:18:00:: and so on - have the values---values%1:09:00:: of Christian civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: internalized in them .
Furthermore , religion---religion%1:09:00:: tends to integrate the whole range---range%1:07:00:: of values---values%1:09:00:: from the highest or ultimate values---values%1:09:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: to the intermediary---intermediary%1:18:00:: and subordinate values---values%1:09:00:: ; for example , those regarding material objects---object%1:03:00:: and pragmatic ends---end%1:09:02:: .
Finally , it gives sanctity---sanctity%1:07:00:: , more than human legitimacy---legitimacy%1:07:00:: , and even , through super empirical reference---reference%1:09:00:: , transcendent and supernatural importance---importance%1:07:00:: to some values---values%1:09:00:: ; for example , marriage---marriage%1:26:00:: as a sacrament---sacrament%1:04:00:: , much law-breaking---law-breaking%1:04:00:: as sinful , occasionally the state---state%1:03:00:: as a divine instrument---instrument%1:18:00:: .
It places certain values---values%1:09:00:: at least beyond questioning---questioning%1:10:00:: and tampering---tampering%1:04:00:: .
Closely related to this function---function%1:07:00:: is the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that the religious system---system%1:09:02:: provides a body---body%1:07:00:: of ultimate ends---end%1:09:02:: for the society---society%1:14:00:: , which are compatible with the supreme eternal ends---end%1:09:02:: .
This something leads to a conception---conception%1:09:03:: of an over-all Social Plan---plan%1:09:01:: with a meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: interpretable in terms of ultimate ends---end%1:09:02:: ; for example , a plan---plan%1:09:00:: that fulfills the will---will%1:09:01:: of God---god%1:18:00:: , which advances the Kingdom of God , which involves social life---life%1:26:01:: as part---part%1:24:00:: of the Grand Design---design%1:09:01:: .
This explains some group---group%1:03:00:: ends---end%1:09:02:: and provides a justification---justification%1:10:00:: of their primacy---primacy%1:26:00:: .
It gives social guidance---guidance%1:10:00:: and direction---direction%1:10:00:: and makes for programs---program%1:09:00:: of social action---action%1:04:02:: .
Finally , it gives meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: to much social endeavor---endeavor%1:04:00:: , and logic---logic%1:09:00:: , consistency---consistency%1:07:02:: , and meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: to life---life%1:09:00:: .
In general , there is no society---society%1:14:00:: so secularized as to be completely without religiously inspired transcendental ends---end%1:09:02:: .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: integrates and unifies .
Some of the oldest , most persistent , and most cohesive forms---form%1:09:01:: of social groupings---grouping%1:04:00:: have grown out of religion---religion%1:09:00:: .
These groups---group%1:03:00:: have varied widely from mere families---family%1:14:02:: , primitive , totemic groups---group%1:03:00:: , and small modern cults---cult%1:14:00:: and sects---sect%1:14:01:: , to the memberships---membership%1:14:00:: of great denominations---denomination%1:14:00:: , and great , widely dispersed world religions---religion%1:09:00:: .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: fosters group---group%1:03:00:: life---life%1:26:01:: in various ways---way%1:07:01:: .
The common ultimate values---values%1:09:00:: , ends---end%1:09:02:: and goals---goal%1:09:00:: fostered by religion---religion%1:09:00:: are a most important factor---factor%1:11:00:: .
Without a system of values---value-system%1:09:00:: there can be no society---society%1:14:00:: .
Where such a value system---value-system%1:09:00:: prevails , it always unifies all who possess it ; it enables members---member%1:18:00:: of the society---society%1:14:00:: to operate as a system---system%1:14:00:: .
The beliefs of a religion---religion%1:09:00:: also reflecting the values---values%1:09:00:: are expressed in creeds---creed%1:10:00:: , dogmas---dogma%1:10:00:: , and doctrines---doctrine%1:09:00:: , and form what Durkheim---person%1:03:00:: calls a credo---credo%1:09:00:: .
As he points out , a religious group---group%1:03:00:: cannot exist without a collective credo---credo%1:09:00:: , and the more extensive the credo---credo%1:09:00:: , the more unified and strong is the group---group%1:03:00:: .
The credo---credo%1:09:00:: unifies and socializes men---man%1:05:01:: by attaching them completely to an identical body---body%1:14:02:: of doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: ; the more extensive and firm the body---body%1:14:02:: of doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: , the firmer the group---group%1:03:00:: .
The religious symbolism---symbolism%1:04:00:: , and especially the closely related rites---rite%1:04:01:: and worship---worship%1:04:00:: forms---form%1:09:01:: , constitute a powerful bond---bond%1:24:00:: for the members---member%1:18:00:: of the particular faith---faith%1:14:00:: .
The religion---religion%1:09:00:: , in fact , is an expression---expression%1:10:02:: of the unity---unity%1:26:00:: of the group---group%1:03:00:: , small or large .
The common codes---code%1:10:01:: , for religious action---action%1:04:02:: as such and in their ethical aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: for everyday moral behavior---behavior%1:07:00:: , bind the devotees---devotee%1:18:00:: together .
These are ways---way%1:04:01:: of jointly participating in significantly symbolized , standardized , and ordered religiously sanctified behavior---behavior%1:07:00:: .
The codes---code%1:10:01:: are mechanism---mechanism%1:04:00:: for training---training%1:04:00:: in , and directing and enforcing , uniform social interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: , and for continually and publicly reasserting the solidarity---solidarity%1:07:00:: of the group---group%1:03:00:: .
Durkheim---person%1:03:00:: noted long ago that religion---religion%1:09:00:: as `` a unified system---system%1:09:02:: of beliefs and practices---practice%1:04:00:: relative to sacred things---thing%1:09:00:: - unite [ s ] into one single moral community---community%1:14:00:: - all those who adhere to them '' .
His view---view%1:09:04:: is that every religion---religion%1:09:00:: pertains to a community---community%1:14:00:: , and , conversely , every community---community%1:14:00:: is in one aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: a religious unit---unit%1:14:00:: .
This is brought out in the common religious ethos---ethos%1:07:00:: that prevails even in the denominationally diverse audiences---audience%1:14:00:: at many secular semi-public and public occasions---occasion%1:11:01:: in the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: ; and it is evidenced in the prayers---prayer%1:04:00:: offered , in the frequent religious allusions---allusion%1:10:00:: , and in the confirmation---confirmation%1:09:00:: of points---point%1:09:01:: on religious grounds---grounds%1:09:00:: .
The unifying effect---effect%1:19:00:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: is also brought out in the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that historically peoples---people%1:14:00:: have clung together as more or less cohesive cultural units---unit%1:14:00:: , with religion---religion%1:09:00:: as the dominant bond---bond%1:24:00:: , even though spatially dispersed and not politically organized .
The Jews---person%1:03:00:: for 2500 years---year%1:28:01:: have been a prime example---example%1:09:02:: , though the adherents---adherent%1:18:00:: of any world or inter people---people%1:14:00:: religion---religion%1:09:00:: are cases in point---case_in_point%1:09:00:: .
it might be pointed out that the integrating---integrating%1:04:00:: function---function%1:07:00:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: , for good---good%1:07:00:: or ill , has often supported or been identified with other groupings---grouping%1:03:00:: - political , nationality---nationality%1:14:00:: , language---language%1:10:00:: , class---class%1:14:01:: , racial , sociability---sociability%1:07:00:: , even economic .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: usually exercises a stabilizing conserving function---function%1:07:00:: .
As such it acts as an anchor---anchor%1:09:00:: for the people---people%1:14:00:: .
There is a marked tendency---tendency%1:12:00:: for religions---religion%1:09:00:: , once firmly established , to resist change---change%1:04:00:: , not only in their own doctrines---doctrine%1:09:00:: and policies---policy%1:10:00:: and practices---practice%1:04:00:: , but also in secular affairs---affairs%1:09:00:: having religious relevance---relevance%1:24:00:: .
There is a marked tendency for religions , once firmly established , to resist change---change%1:11:00:: , not only in their own doctrines and policies and practices , but also in secular affairs having religious relevance .
It has thus been a significant factor---factor%1:11:00:: in the conservation---conservation%1:11:00:: of social values---values%1:09:00:: , though also in some measure , an obstacle---obstacle%1:06:00:: to the creation---creation%1:04:01:: or diffusion---diffusion%1:07:00:: of new ones .
It tends to support the longstanding precious sentiments---sentiment%1:09:00:: , the traditional ways---way%1:04:00:: of thinking---thinking%1:09:00:: , and the customary ways---way%1:04:00:: of living .
As Yinger---person%1:03:00:: has pointed out , the `` reliance---reliance%1:09:00:: on symbols---symbol%1:10:00:: , on tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: , on sacred writings---sacred_writing%1:10:00:: , on the cultivation---cultivation%1:04:01:: of emotional feelings---feelings%1:12:00:: of identity---identity%1:07:00:: and harmony---harmony%1:26:00:: with sacred values---values%1:09:00:: , turns one to the past---past%1:28:00:: far more than to the future---future%1:28:00:: '' .
Historically , religion---religion%1:09:00:: has also functioned as a tremendous engine---engine%1:19:00:: of vindication---vindication%1:04:01:: , enforcement---enforcement%1:04:00:: , sanction , and perpetuation---perpetuation%1:04:00:: of various other institutions---institution%1:14:00:: .
At the same time that religion---religion%1:09:00:: exercises a conserving influence---influence%1:07:00:: , it also energizes and motivates both individuals---individual%1:03:00:: and groups---group%1:03:00:: .
Much---much%1:23:00:: of the important individual---individual%1:03:00:: and social action---action%1:04:02:: has been owing to religious incentives---incentive%1:21:00:: .
The great ultimate ends---end%1:09:02:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: have served as magnificent beacon lights---beacon_light%1:06:00:: that lured people---people%1:14:00:: toward them with an almost irresistible force---force%1:07:01:: , mobilizing energies---energy%1:07:00:: and inducing sacrifices---sacrifice%1:04:01:: ; for example , the Crusades---crusade%1:04:01:: , mission---mission%1:14:01:: efforts---effort%1:04:00:: , just wars---war%1:04:00:: .
Much effort---effort%1:04:00:: has been expended in the sincere effort---effort%1:04:00:: to apply the teaching---teaching%1:09:00:: and admonitions---admonition%1:10:01:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: .
The insuperable reward---reward%1:04:01:: systems---system%1:09:00:: that most religions---religion%1:09:00:: embody have great motivating effects---effect%1:19:00:: .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: provides the most attractive rewards---reward%1:04:01:: , either in this world---world%1:09:01:: or the next , for those who not merely abide by its norms---norm%1:09:00:: , but who engage in good works---works%1:04:00:: .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: usually acts as a powerful aid---aid%1:07:00:: in social control---social_control%1:04:00:: , enforcing what men should or should not do .
Among primitive peoples---people%1:14:00:: the sanctions---sanction%1:10:00:: and dictates---dictate%1:09:00:: of religion---religion%1:09:00:: were more binding than any of the other controls---control%1:24:00:: exercised by the group---group%1:03:00:: ; and in modern societies---society%1:14:00:: such influence---influence%1:07:00:: is still great .
Religion---religion%1:09:00:: has its own supernatural prescriptions---prescription%1:10:00:: that are at the same time codes of behavior---code_of_behavior%1:09:00:: for the here and now---here_and_now%1:28:00:: .
Many other ( probably nearly all ) snakes---snake%1:05:00:: at maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: are already more than half---half%1:23:00:: their final length---length%1:07:00:: .
Laurence M . Klauber---person%1:03:00:: put length---length%1:07:00:: at maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: at two thirds---third%1:23:00:: the ultimate length---length%1:07:00:: for some rattlesnakes---rattlesnake%1:05:00:: , and Charles C . Carpenter---person%1:03:00:: 's data---data%1:14:00:: on Michigan---location%1:03:00:: garter---garter_snake%1:05:00:: and ribbon snakes---ribbon_snake%1:05:00:: ( Thamnophis---thamnophis%1:05:00:: ) show that the smallest gravid females---female%1:05:00:: are more than half as long as the biggest adults---adult%1:05:00:: .
Felix Kopstein---person%1:03:00:: states that `` when the snake---snake%1:05:00:: reaches its maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: it has already reached about its maximal length---length%1:07:00:: '' , but goes on to cite the reticulate python---python%1:05:00:: as an exception---exception%1:09:01:: , with maximum length---length%1:07:00:: approximately three times that at maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: .
It is hard to understand how he concluded that most snakes---snake%1:05:00:: do not grow appreciably after attaining maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: ; he was working with species---species%1:14:00:: of Java---location%1:03:00:: , so perhaps some tropical snakes---snake%1:05:00:: are unusual in this respect---respect%1:09:00:: .
Certain individual giants---giant%1:05:00:: recorded later did fail to show a reasonable difference---difference%1:07:00:: after maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: , but it is impossible to know whether this is due to captive conditions---condition%1:26:00:: .
Additional records---record%1:10:03:: of slow growth---growth%1:22:00:: have been omitted .
It is possible to make a few generalizations---generalization%1:09:01:: about the six giants---giant%1:05:00:: themselves .
There seems to be a rough correlation---correlation%1:24:00:: between the initial and ultimate lengths---length%1:07:00:: , starting with the smallest ( boa constrictor---boa_constrictor%1:05:00:: ) and ending with the largest ( anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: ) .
Data---data%1:14:00:: on the former are scanty , but there can be little doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: that the latter is sometimes born at a length---length%1:07:00:: greater than that of any of the others , thereby lending support---support%1:09:00:: to the belief---belief%1:09:00:: that the anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: does , indeed , attain the greatest length---length%1:07:00:: .
For four of the six ( the anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: and the amethystine python---amethystine_python%1:05:00:: cannot be included for lack---lack%1:26:00:: of data---data%1:14:00:: ) there is also a correlation---correlation%1:24:00:: between size---size%1:07:00:: at maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: and maximum length---length%1:07:00:: , the boa constrictor---boa_constrictor%1:05:00:: being the smallest and the Indian python---indian_python%1:05:00:: the next in size---size%1:07:00:: at the former stage---stage%1:28:00:: .
Let us speculate a little on the maximum size---size%1:07:00:: of the anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: .
If , in a certain part---part%1:24:00:: of the range---range%1:07:00:: , it starts life---life%1:28:00:: 1 foot---foot%1:23:00:: longer than do any of the other ( relatively large ) giants---giant%1:05:00:: , and reaches maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: at , let us guess , 18 inches---inch%1:23:00:: longer than the others , a quadrupling---quadrupling%1:22:00:: of the maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: length---length%1:07:00:: would result in a maximum---maximum%1:23:00:: of ( nearly ) 40 feet---foot%1:23:00:: .
When it comes to rate---rate%1:28:00:: of early growth---growth%1:22:00:: , the Indian python---indian_python%1:05:00:: leads with a figure---figure%1:23:00:: of about 3 feet---foot%1:23:00:: 6 inches---inch%1:23:00:: per year for the first two years---year%1:28:01:: , more or less .
The African rock python---rock_python%1:05:00:: , a close second , is followed in turn by the reticulate python---python%1:05:00:: .
There are few data---data%1:14:00:: on the boa constrictor---boa_constrictor%1:05:00:: , those for the anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: are unconvincing , and there is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: at all on the amethystine python---amethystine_python%1:05:00:: .
It seems likely that the Indian python---indian_python%1:05:00:: comes out ahead because records---record%1:10:03:: of its growth---growth%1:22:00:: have been made more carefully and frequently ; it responds exceptionally well to captivity---captivity%1:26:02:: and does not reach proportions---proportion%1:24:00:: that make it hard to keep .
I cannot make sense out of the figures---figure%1:23:00:: for post maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: growth---growth%1:22:00:: ; at best the annual increase---increase%1:07:00:: appears to be a matter---matter%1:09:01:: of inches---inch%1:23:00:: rather than feet---foot%1:23:00:: .
Until better records---record%1:10:03:: have been kept over longer periods of time---period_of_time%1:28:00:: and much more is known about the maximum dimensions---dimension%1:07:00:: , it will be wise to refrain from drawing conclusions---conclusion%1:09:00:: .
It is often stated that the largest snakes---snake%1:05:00:: require five years---year%1:28:01:: to attain maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: , but this apparently is an overestimation---overestimation%1:10:00:: .
The best way---way%1:04:01:: to determine the correct figure---figure%1:23:00:: ( in captives---captive%1:18:01:: ) is by direct observation---observation%1:04:01:: of pairs---pair%1:23:00:: isolated from birth---birth%1:28:00:: , a method---method%1:09:00:: that produced surprising results---result%1:19:00:: : maturing of a male Indian python---indian_python%1:05:00:: in less than two years---year%1:28:01:: , his mate---mate%1:18:01:: in less than three ; data---data%1:14:00:: on the boa constrictor---boa_constrictor%1:05:00:: about match this .
Another approach---approach%1:04:02:: is to estimate from the rate of growth---rate_of_growth%1:28:00:: and the smallest size---size%1:07:00:: at maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: .
Results---result%1:10:00:: from this approach---approach%1:04:02:: amply confirm the direct observations---observation%1:04:01:: :
about three years---year%1:28:01:: are required , there being a possible slight difference---difference%1:07:00:: between males---male%1:18:00:: and females---female%1:18:00:: in the time---time%1:28:05:: required .
Only the amethystine python---amethystine_python%1:05:00:: and the anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: must be excluded for lack---lack%1:26:00:: or paucity---paucity%1:07:01:: of data---data%1:14:00:: .
The following information---information%1:10:00:: on snakes---snake%1:05:00:: varying greatly in size---size%1:07:00:: ( but all with less than a 10 - foot---foot%1:23:00:: maximum---maximum%1:23:00:: ) shows , when considered with the foregoing , that there is probably no correlation---correlation%1:24:00:: between the length---length%1:07:00:: of a snake---snake%1:05:00:: and the time---time%1:28:05:: required for it to mature .
Oliver---person%1:03:00:: , in his summary---summary%1:10:00:: of the habits---habit%1:09:00:: of the snakes---snake%1:05:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: , could supply data---data%1:14:00:: on the maturing period---period%1:28:00:: for only three species---species%1:14:00:: in addition to the rattlers---rattler%1:05:00:: , which I shall consider separately .
These three were much alike : lined snake---lined_snake%1:05:00:: ( Tropidoclonion---tropidoclonion%1:05:00:: ) , one year---year%1:28:01:: and nine months---month%1:28:00:: ; red-bellied snake---red-bellied_snake%1:05:00:: ( Storeria---storeria%1:05:00:: ) , two years---year%1:28:01:: ; cottonmouth---cottonmouth%1:05:00:: ( Ancistrodon---ancistrodon%1:05:00:: ) , two years---year%1:28:01:: .
Klauber---person%1:03:00:: investigated the rattlesnakes---rattlesnake%1:05:00:: carefully himself and also summarized what others have found .
He concluded that in the southern species---species%1:14:00:: , which are rapidly growing types---type%1:09:00:: , females---female%1:05:00:: mate at the age---age%1:07:00:: of two and a half---half%1:23:00:: and bear the first young---young%1:05:00:: when they are three .
Other herpetologists---herpetologist%1:18:00:: have ascertained that in the northern United States---united_states%1:15:00:: the prairie rattlesnake---prairie_rattlesnake%1:05:00:: may not give first birth until it is four or even five years---year%1:28:01:: old , and that the young---young%1:05:00:: may be born every other year---year%1:28:01:: , rather than annually .
Carpenter---person%1:03:00:: 's study---study%1:04:00:: showed that female common garter---garter_snake%1:05:00:: and ribbon snakes---ribbon_snake%1:05:00:: of Michigan---location%1:03:00:: mature at about the age---age%1:07:00:: of two---two%1:23:00:: .
Oversized monsters---monster%1:18:01:: are never brought home either alive or preserved , and field---field%1:15:01:: measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: are obviously open to doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: because of the universal tendency---tendency%1:12:00:: to exaggerate dimensions---dimension%1:07:00:: .
Measurements of skins---skin%1:05:01:: are of little value---value%1:07:00:: ; every snake---snake%1:05:00:: hide---hide%1:05:00:: is noticeably longer than its carcass---carcass%1:05:00:: and intentional stretching---stretching%1:04:02:: presents no difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: to the unscrupulous explorer---explorer%1:18:00:: .
In spite of all the pitfalls---pitfall%1:09:00:: , there is a certain amount---amount%1:07:00:: of agreement---agreement%1:07:00:: on some of the giants---giant%1:05:00:: .
The anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: proves to be the fly in the ointment---fly_in_the_ointment%1:07:00:: , but the reason---reason%1:10:01:: for this is not clear ; the relatively wild conditions---condition%1:26:00:: still found in tropical South America---location%1:03:00:: might be responsible .
There are three levels---level%1:26:01:: on which to treat the subject---subject%1:09:00:: .
The first is the strictly scientific , which demands concrete proof---proof%1:10:00:: and therefore may err on the conservative side---side%1:14:00:: by waiting for evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: in the flesh .
This approach---approach%1:04:02:: rejects virtually all field---field%1:15:01:: measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: .
The next level---level%1:26:01:: attempts to weigh varied evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: and come to a balanced , sensible conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: ; field---field%1:15:01:: measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: by experienced explorers---explorer%1:18:00:: are not rejected , and even reports---report%1:10:03:: of a less scientific nature---nature%1:07:02:: are duly evaluated .
The third level---level%1:26:01:: leans on a belief---belief%1:09:00:: that a lot of smoke---smoke%1:19:00:: means some fire---fire%1:22:00:: .
The argument---argument%1:10:02:: against this last approach---approach%1:04:02:: is comparable to that which rejects stories---story%1:10:03:: about hoop snakes---hoop_snake%1:05:00:: , about snakes---snake%1:05:00:: that break themselves into many pieces---piece%1:17:00:: and join up again , or even of ghosts---ghost%1:09:00:: that chase---chase%1:04:00:: people---people%1:14:00:: out of graveyards---graveyard%1:15:00:: ; the mere piling up of testimony---testimony%1:10:01:: does not prove , to the scientific mind---mind%1:09:00:: , the existence---existence%1:26:00:: of hoop snakes---hoop_snake%1:05:00:: , joint snakes---joint_snake%1:05:00:: , or ghosts---ghost%1:09:00:: .
Oliver---person%1:03:00:: has recently used the second level---level%1:26:01:: approach---approach%1:04:02:: with the largest snakes---snake%1:05:00:: , and has come to these conclusions---conclusion%1:09:00:: :
the anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: reaches a length---length%1:07:00:: of at least 37 feet---foot%1:23:00:: , the reticulate python---python%1:05:00:: 33 , the African rock python---rock_python%1:05:00:: 25 , the amethystine python---amethystine_python%1:05:00:: at least 22 , the Indian python---indian_python%1:05:00:: 20 , and the boa constrictor---boa_constrictor%1:05:00:: 18 - 1 2 .
Bernard Heuvelmans---person%1:03:00:: also treats of the largest snakes---snake%1:05:00:: , but on the third level---level%1:26:01:: , and is chiefly concerned with the anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: .
He reasons that as anacondas---anaconda%1:05:00:: 30 feet---foot%1:23:00:: long are often found , some might be 38 , and occasional `` monstrous freaks---freak%1:18:00:: '' over 50 .
He rejects dimensions---dimension%1:07:00:: of 70 feet---foot%1:23:00:: and more .
His thirteenth chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: includes many exciting accounts---account%1:10:00:: of huge serpents---serpent%1:05:00:: with prodigious strength---strength%1:07:00:: , but these seem to be given to complete his picture---picture%1:26:00:: , not to be believed .
Detailed information---information%1:10:00:: on record lengths---length%1:07:00:: of the giants---giant%1:05:00:: is given in the section---section%1:10:00:: that follows .
Discussions---discussion%1:10:02:: of the giants---giant%1:05:00:: one by one will include , as far as possible , data---data%1:14:00:: on these aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: of growth---growth%1:22:00:: :
size---size%1:07:00:: at which life---life%1:28:00:: is started and at which sexual maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: is reached ; time---time%1:28:05:: required to reach maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: ; rate of growth---rate_of_growth%1:28:00:: both before and after this crucial stage---stage%1:28:00:: ; and maximum length---length%1:07:00:: , with confirmation---confirmation%1:09:00:: or amplification---amplification%1:04:02:: of Oliver---person%1:03:00:: 's figures---figure%1:23:00:: .
Definite information---information%1:10:00:: on the growth---growth%1:22:00:: of senile individuals---individual%1:18:00:: is lacking .
At birth , this species---species%1:14:00:: varies considerably in size---size%1:07:00:: .
A brood---brood%1:14:00:: of twenty-eight---twenty-eight%1:23:00:: born at Brookfield Zoo---group%1:03:00:: , near Chicago---location%1:03:00:: , ranged in length from 22 to 33 - 1 2 inches---inch%1:23:00:: and averaged 29 inches---inch%1:23:00:: .
Lawrence E . Griffin---person%1:03:00:: gives measurements of nineteen young anacondas---anaconda%1:05:00:: , presumably members---member%1:18:00:: of a brood---brood%1:14:00:: , from `` South America---location%1:03:00:: '' ; the extreme---extreme%1:15:00:: measurements of these fall between the lower limit---lower_limit%1:23:00:: of the Brookfield---group%1:03:00:: brood---brood%1:14:00:: and its average---average%1:09:00:: .
Raymond L . Ditmars---person%1:03:00:: had two broods---brood%1:14:00:: that averaged 27 inches---inch%1:23:00:: .
R . R . Mole---person%1:03:00:: and F . W . Urich---person%1:03:00:: give approximately 20 inches---inch%1:23:00:: as the average length---length%1:07:00:: of a brood---brood%1:14:00:: of thirty---thirty%1:23:00:: from the region---region%1:15:00:: of the Orinoco---orinoco%1:17:00:: estuaries---estuary%1:17:00:: .
William Beebe---person%1:03:00:: reports---report%1:10:03:: 26 inches---inch%1:23:00:: and 2.4 ounces---ounce%1:23:02:: ( this snake---snake%1:05:00:: must have been emaciated ) for the length---length%1:07:00:: and the weight---weight%1:07:00:: of a young anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: from British Guiana---location%1:03:00:: .
In contrast---contrast%1:04:00:: , Ditmars---person%1:03:00:: recorded the average length---length%1:07:00:: of seventy-two young---young%1:05:00:: of a 19 - foot---foot%1:23:00:: female---female%1:05:00:: as 38 inches---inch%1:23:00:: , and four young---young%1:05:00:: were born in London---location%1:03:00:: at a length---length%1:07:00:: of 35 or 36 inches---inch%1:23:00:: and a weight---weight%1:07:00:: of from 14 to 16 ounces---ounce%1:23:02:: .
Beebe---person%1:03:00:: had a 3 - foot---foot%1:23:00:: anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: that weighed only 9.8 ounces---ounce%1:23:02:: .
A difference---difference%1:07:00:: between subspecies---subspecies%1:14:00:: might explain the great range---range%1:07:00:: in size---size%1:07:00:: .
I have little information---information%1:10:00:: on the anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: 's rate of growth---rate_of_growth%1:28:00:: .
Hans Schweizer---person%1:03:00:: had one that increased from 19 - 1 2 inches---inch%1:23:02:: to 5 feet---foot%1:23:00:: 3 inches---inch%1:23:02:: in five years---year%1:28:01:: , and J . J . Quelch---person%1:03:00:: records a growth---growth%1:22:00:: of from less than 4 feet---foot%1:23:00:: to nearly 10 in about six years---year%1:28:01:: .
It is very unlikely that either of these anacondas---anaconda%1:05:00:: was growing at a normal rate---rate%1:28:00:: .
In 1948 , Afranio do Amaral---person%1:03:00:: , the noted Brazilian herpetologist---herpetologist%1:18:00:: , wrote a technical paper---paper%1:10:01:: on the giant snakes---snake%1:05:00:: .
He concluded that the anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: 's maximum length---length%1:07:00:: is 12 or 13 ( perhaps 14 ) meters---meter%1:23:00:: , which would approximate from 39 to 42 feet---foot%1:23:00:: ( 14 meters---meter%1:23:00:: is slightly less that 46 feet---foot%1:23:00:: ) .
Thus , his estimate---estimate%1:09:00:: lies between Oliver---person%1:03:00:: 's suggestion---suggestion%1:10:00:: of at least 37 feet---foot%1:23:00:: and the 50 - foot---foot%1:23:00:: `` monstrous freaks---freak%1:18:00:: '' intimated by Heuvelmans---person%1:03:00:: .
The most convincing recent measurement of an anaconda---anaconda%1:05:00:: was made in eastern Colombia---location%1:03:00:: by Roberto Lamon---person%1:03:00:: , a petroleum geologist---petroleum_geologist%1:18:00:: of the Richmond Oil Company---group%1:03:00:: , and reported in 1944 by Emmett R . Dunn---person%1:03:00:: .
However , as a field---field%1:15:01:: measurement , it is open to question---question%1:10:00:: .
Oliver---person%1:03:00:: 's 37 - 1 2 feet---foot%1:23:00:: is partly based on this report---report%1:10:01:: and can be accepted as probable .
However , many herpetologists---herpetologist%1:18:00:: remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum---maximum%1:23:00:: of about 30 feet---foot%1:23:00:: .
It is possible that especially large anacondas---anaconda%1:05:00:: will prove to belong to subspecies---subspecies%1:14:00:: limited to a small area---area%1:15:01:: .
In snakes---snake%1:05:00:: difference---difference%1:07:00:: in size---size%1:07:00:: is a common characteristic---characteristic%1:09:00:: of subspecies---subspecies%1:14:00:: .
A Colombian female---female%1:05:00:: 's brood---brood%1:14:00:: of sixteen boa constrictors---boa_constrictor%1:05:00:: born in the Staten Island Zoo---group%1:03:00:: averaged 20 inches---inch%1:23:00:: .
This birth---birth%1:28:00:: length---length%1:07:00:: seems to be typical .
When some thirteen records---record%1:10:03:: of newly and recently born individuals---individual%1:18:00:: are collated , little or no correlation---correlation%1:24:00:: between length---length%1:07:00:: and distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: can be detected .
The range---range%1:07:00:: is from 14 to 25 inches---inch%1:23:00:: ; the former figure---figure%1:23:00:: is based on a somewhat unusual birth---birth%1:28:00:: of four---four%1:23:00:: by a Central American female---female%1:05:00:: ( see chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: on Laying---laying%1:22:00:: , Brooding---brooding%1:22:00:: , Hatching---hatching%1:22:00:: , and Birth---birth%1:22:00:: ) , the latter on a `` normal '' newly born individual---individual%1:18:00:: .
However , as so many of the records---record%1:10:03:: are not certainly based on newborn snakes---snake%1:05:00:: , these data---data%1:14:00:: must be taken tentatively ; final conclusions---conclusion%1:09:00:: will have to await the measurements of broods---brood%1:14:00:: from definite localities---locality%1:15:00:: .
Alphonse R . Hoge---person%1:03:00:: 's measurements of several very young specimens---specimen%1:09:00:: from Brazil---location%1:03:00:: suggest that at birth the female---female%1:05:00:: is slightly larger than the male---male%1:05:00:: .
I have surprisingly little information---information%1:09:00:: on the size---size%1:07:00:: and age---age%1:07:00:: at maturity---maturity%1:28:00:: .
Carl Kauffeld---person%1:03:00:: has written to me of sexual activity---sexual_activity%1:04:00:: in February---february%1:28:00:: 1943 of young---young%1:05:00:: born in March---march%1:28:00:: 1940 .
One female---female%1:05:00:: , collected on an island---island%1:17:00:: off the coast---coast%1:17:00:: of Nicaragua---location%1:03:00:: , was gravid and measured 4 feet---foot%1:23:00:: 8 inches---inch%1:23:00:: from snout---snout%1:05:00:: to vent---vent%1:05:00:: ( her tail---tail%1:05:00:: should be between 6 and 7 inches---inch%1:23:00:: long ) .
The female---female%1:05:00:: from Central America---location%1:03:00:: which gave birth to four was only 3 feet---foot%1:23:00:: 11 inches---inch%1:23:00:: long .
What data---data%1:14:00:: there are on growth---growth%1:22:00:: indicate considerable variation---variation%1:11:01:: in rate---rate%1:28:00:: ; unfortunately , no one has kept complete records---record%1:10:03:: of one individual---individual%1:18:00:: , whereas many have been made for a very short period of time---period_of_time%1:28:00:: .
The results---result%1:10:00:: are too varied to allow generalization---generalization%1:09:01:: .
Payne---person%1:03:00:: dismounted in Madison Place---location%1:03:00:: and handed the reins---rein%1:06:00:: to Herold---location%1:03:00:: .
There was a fog---fog%1:19:00:: , which increased the darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: of the night---night%1:28:00:: .
Two gas lamps---gas_lamp%1:06:00:: were no more than a misleading glow---glow%1:07:00:: .
The pretence---pretence%1:07:00:: was that he was delivering a prescription---prescription%1:06:00:: from Dr. Verdi---person%1:03:00:: .
Secretary of State---secretary_of_state%1:18:00:: Seward---person%1:03:00:: was a sick man---man%1:18:00:: .
The idea---idea%1:09:00:: had come from Herold---person%1:03:00:: , who had once been a chemist---chemist%1:18:01:: 's clerk---clerk%1:18:00:: .
The sick were always receiving medicines---medicine%1:06:00:: .
No one would question such an errand---errand%1:04:00:: .
The bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: was filled up with flour---flour%1:13:00:: .
Before Payne---person%1:03:00:: loomed the Old Clubhouse---group%1:03:00:: , Seward---person%1:03:00:: 's home---home%1:06:00:: , where Key---person%1:03:00:: had once been killed .
Now---now%1:28:00:: it would have another death---death%1:11:00:: .
From the outside---outside%1:15:01:: it was an ordinary enough house---house%1:06:00:: of the gentry---gentry%1:14:00:: .
He clomped heavily up the stoop---stoop%1:04:00:: and rang the bell---bell%1:06:02:: .
Like the bell---bell%1:06:00:: at Mass---mass%1:04:00:: , the doorbell---doorbell%1:06:00:: was pitched too high .
It was still Good Friday---good_friday%1:28:00:: , after all .
A nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: boy---boy%1:18:00:: opened the door---door%1:06:00:: .
Payne---person%1:03:00:: did not notice him .
He was thinking chiefly of Cap---person%1:03:00:: .
If their schedules---schedule%1:09:00:: were to synchronize , there was no point---point%1:10:01:: in wasting time .
He pushed his way---way%1:23:00:: inside---inside%1:15:00:: .
For a moment---moment%1:28:00:: the hall---hall%1:06:05:: confused him .
This was the largest house---house%1:06:00:: he had ever been in , almost the largest building---building%1:06:00:: , except for a hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: .
He had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: where Seward---person%1:03:00:: 's room---room%1:06:00:: would be .
In the half---half%1:23:00:: darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: the banisters---banister%1:06:00:: gleamed , and the hall---hall%1:06:05:: seemed enormous .
Above him somewhere were the bedrooms---bedroom%1:06:00:: .
Seward---person%1:03:00:: would be up there .
He explained his errand---errand%1:04:00:: , but without bothering much to make it plausible , for he felt something well up in him which was the reason---reason%1:16:00:: why he had fled the army---army%1:14:00:: .
He did not really want to kill---kill%1:04:00:: , but as in the sexual act---sex_act%1:04:00:: , there was a moment---moment%1:28:00:: when the impulse---impulse%1:16:00:: took over and could not be downed , even while you watched yourself giving way to it .
He knew that in this mood---mood%1:26:00:: he could not be stopped .
Still , the sensation---sensation%1:09:00:: always surprised him .
It was a thrill---thrill%1:12:00:: he felt no part---part%1:24:00:: in .
He could only watch with a sort---sort%1:09:00:: of gentle dismay---dismay%1:12:02:: while his body---body%1:08:00:: did these quick , appalling , and efficient things---thing%1:04:00:: .
He brushed by the idiotic boy---boy%1:18:00:: and lumbered heavily up the stairs .
They were carpeted , but made for pumps and congress gaiters---congress_gaiter%1:06:00:: , not the great clodhoppers---clodhopper%1:06:00:: he wore .
The sound---sound%1:07:00:: of his footsteps---footstep%1:04:00:: was like a muffled drum---drum%1:06:00:: .
At the top---top%1:15:00:: of the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: he ran into somebody standing there angrily in a dressing gown---dressing_gown%1:06:00:: .
He stopped and whispered his errand---errand%1:04:00:: .
Young Frederick Seward---person%1:03:00:: held out his hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
Panting a little , Payne---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
Dr. Verdi---person%1:03:00:: had told him to deliver his package---package%1:06:00:: in person .
Frederick Seward---person%1:03:00:: said his father---father%1:18:00:: was sleeping , and then went through a pantomime---pantomime%1:04:00:: at his father---father%1:18:00:: 's door---door%1:06:01:: , to prove the statement---statement%1:10:00:: .
`` Very well '' , Payne---person%1:03:00:: said .
He smiled , but now that he knew where the elder Seward---person%1:03:00:: was , he did not intend to go .
He pulled out his pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: and fired it .
It made no sound---sound%1:19:00:: .
Reversing it , he smashed the butt---butt%1:06:00:: down on Frederick Seward---person%1:03:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: , over and over again .
It was the first blow---blow%1:11:00:: that was always difficult .
After that , violence---violence%1:04:01:: was exultantly easy .
He got caught up into it and became a different person---person%1:03:00:: .
Only afterwards did an act---act%1:03:00:: like that become meaningless , so that he would puzzle over it for days---day%1:28:00:: , whereas at the time---time%1:28:00:: it had seemed quite real .
The nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: boy---boy%1:18:00:: fled down the stairs , screaming , `` Murder---murder%1:04:00:: '' .
It was not murder---murder%1:04:00:: at all .
Payne---person%1:03:00:: was more methodical than that .
He was merely clearing a way---way%1:23:00:: to what he had to do .
He ran for the sick room---sickroom%1:06:00:: , found his pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: was broken , and threw it away .
A knife---knife%1:06:00:: would do .
From childhood---childhood%1:28:00:: he had known all about knives---knife%1:06:00:: .
Someone---someone%1:03:00:: blocked the door---door%1:06:00:: from inside---inside%1:15:00:: .
He smashed it in and tumbled into darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: .
He saw only dimly moving figures---figure%1:08:00:: , but when he slashed them they yelled and fled .
He went for the bed---bed%1:06:00:: , jumped on it , and struck where he could , repeatedly .
It was like finally getting into one 's own nightmares---nightmare%1:09:00:: to punish one 's dreams---dream%1:09:01:: .
Two men---man%1:18:00:: pulled him off .
Payne---person%1:03:00:: hacked at their arms---arm%1:08:00:: .
There was a lady---lady%1:18:02:: there , in a nightdress---nightdress%1:06:00:: .
He would not have wanted to hurt a lady---lady%1:18:02:: .
Another man---man%1:18:00:: approached , this one fully dressed .
When the knife---knife%1:06:00:: went into his chest---chest%1:08:00:: , he went down at once .
`` I'm mad '' , shouted Payne---person%1:03:00:: , as he ran out into the hall---hall%1:06:03:: .
That would have made things---thing%1:09:00:: so much easier .
He clattered down the stairs and out of the door---door%1:06:01:: .
Somewhere in the fog---fog%1:19:00:: , the nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: boy---boy%1:18:00:: was still yelling murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
One always wakes up , even from one 's own dreams---dream%1:09:01:: .
The clammy air---air%1:27:00:: revived him .
Herold---person%1:03:00:: , he saw , had fled .
Well , one did not expect much---much%1:23:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: like Herold---person%1:03:00:: .
He unhitched his horse---horse%1:05:00:: , walked it away , mounted , and spurred it on .
The nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: boy---boy%1:18:00:: was close behind him .
Then the nigger---nigger%1:18:00:: boy---boy%1:18:00:: turned back and he was alone .
He had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: where he was .
After some time---time%1:28:05:: he came to an open field---field%1:17:00:: .
An open field---field%1:17:00:: was better than a building---building%1:06:00:: , that was for sure , so he dismounted , turned off the horse---horse%1:05:00:: , and plunged through the grass---grass%1:20:00:: .
He felt curiously sleepy , the world---world%1:17:01:: seemed far away ; he knew he should get to Cap---person%1:03:00:: , but he did n't know how .
Cap---person%1:03:00:: would find him and take care---care%1:04:01:: of him .
So choosing a good tree---tree%1:20:00:: , he clambered up into it , found a comfortable notch---notch%1:25:00:: , and curled up in it to sleep , like the tousled bear---bear%1:05:00:: he was , with his hands---hand%1:08:00:: across his chest---chest%1:08:00:: , as though surfeited with honey---honey%1:13:00:: .
Violence---violence%1:04:01:: always made him tired , but he was not frightened .
In Boston---boston%1:15:00:: , Edwin Booth---person%1:03:00:: was winding up a performance---performance%1:10:00:: of A New Way to Pay Old Debts .
It was a part---part%1:09:01:: so familiar to him that he did not bother to think about it any more .
Acting---acting%1:04:00:: soothed him .
On a stage---stage%1:06:00:: he always knew what to do , and tonight , to judge by the applause---applause%1:10:00:: , he must be doing it better than usual .
As Sir Giles Overreach---person%1:03:00:: ( how often had he had to play that part---part%1:09:01:: , who did not believe a word---word%1:10:00:: of it ) , he raised his arm---arm%1:08:00:: and declaimed : `` Where is my honour---honour%1:10:00:: now '' ?
That was one of the high spots---spot%1:07:02:: of the play---play%1:10:03:: .
The audience---audience%1:14:00:: , as usual , loved it .
If he had any worries---worry%1:09:00:: , it was only the small ones , about Mother---mother%1:18:00:: in New York---new_york%1:15:01:: , and his daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: Edwina---person%1:03:00:: and what she might be doing at this hour---hour%1:28:01:: , with her Aunt Asia---person%1:03:00:: , in Philadelphia---philadelphia%1:15:00:: .
Everyone is ambivalent about his profession---profession%1:04:00:: , if he has practised it long enough , but there were still moments---moment%1:28:00:: when he loved the stage---stage%1:10:00:: and all those unseen people---people%1:14:00:: out there , who might cheer you or boo you , but that was largely , though not entirely , up to you .
They made the world---world%1:17:01:: seem friendly somehow , though he knew it was not .
Wilkes---person%1:03:00:: was quite right about one thing---thing%1:10:00:: .
Laura Keene---person%1:03:00:: had been in the green room---greenroom%1:06:00:: .
The commotion---commotion%1:26:00:: had brought her into the wings---wing%1:06:03:: .
Since she could not act , one part---part%1:09:01:: suited her as well as any other , and so she was the first person---person%1:03:00:: to offer Mr. Lincoln---person%1:03:00:: a glass---glass%1:06:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: , holding it up to the box---box%1:06:02:: , high above her head---head%1:08:00:: , to Miss Harris---person%1:03:00:: , who had asked for it .
She had been one of the first to collect her wits---wit%1:09:00:: .
It was not so much that the shot---shot%1:06:00:: had stunned the audience---audience%1:14:00:: , as that they had been stunned already .
Most of them had seen Our American Cousin before , and unless Miss Keene---person%1:03:00:: was on stage---stage%1:06:00:: , there was not much---much%1:23:00:: to it .
The theatre---theatre%1:06:00:: was hot and they were drugged with boredom---boredom%1:12:00:: .
The stage---stage%1:06:00:: had been empty , except for Harry Hawk---person%1:03:00:: , doing his star---star%1:18:00:: monologue---monologue%1:10:00:: .
The audience---audience%1:14:00:: was fond of Harry Hawk---person%1:03:00:: , he was a dear---dear%1:18:00:: , in or out of character---character%1:09:01:: , but he was not particularly funny .
At the end---end%1:11:00:: of the monologue---monologue%1:10:00:: the audience---audience%1:14:00:: would applaud .
Meanwhile it looked at the scenery---scenery%1:06:00:: .
`` Well , I guess I know enough to turn you inside out , you sockdologizing old mantrap---mantrap%1:18:00:: '' ! said Trenchard---person%1:03:00:: , otherwise Hawk---person%1:03:00:: .
There was always a pause---pause%1:28:00:: here , before the next line---line%1:10:02:: .
That was when the gun---gun%1:06:00:: went off .
Yet even that explosion---explosion%1:11:00:: did not mean much .
Guns---gun%1:06:00:: were going off all over Washington City---location%1:03:00:: these days---day%1:28:03:: , because of the celebrations---celebration%1:11:00:: , and the theatre---theatre%1:06:00:: was not soundproof .
Then the audience---audience%1:14:00:: saw a small , dim figure---figure%1:08:00:: appear at the edge---edge%1:15:00:: of the Presidential box---box%1:06:02:: .
Booth---person%1:03:00:: had delivered his line---line%1:10:02:: .
Behind him billowed a small pungent cloud---cloud%1:19:01:: of smoke---smoke%1:22:00:: .
The figure---figure%1:08:00:: leapt from the box---box%1:06:02:: , almost lost its balance---balance%1:26:00:: , the flag---flag%1:10:01:: draped there tore in the air---air%1:15:00:: , the figure---figure%1:08:00:: landed on its left leg---leg%1:08:01:: , fell on its hands---hand%1:08:00:: , and pressed itself up .
Harry Hawk---person%1:03:00:: still had his arm---arm%1:08:00:: raised towards the wings---wing%1:06:03:: .
His speech---speech%1:10:01:: faltered .
He did not lower his arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
The figure---figure%1:08:00:: was so theatrically dressed , that it was as though a character---character%1:09:01:: from some other play---play%1:10:03:: had blundered into this one .
The play---play%1:10:03:: for Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: was to be a benefit---benefit%1:10:00:: performance---performance%1:10:00:: of The Octoroon .
This figure---figure%1:08:00:: looked like the slave dealer---slave_dealer%1:18:00:: from that .
But it also looked like a toad---toad%1:05:00:: , hopping away from the light---light%1:15:00:: .
There was something maimed and crazy about its motion---motion%1:10:00:: that disturbed them .
Then it disappeared into the wings---wing%1:06:03:: .
Harry Hawk---person%1:03:00:: had not shifted position---position%1:15:00:: , but he at last lowered his arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
Mrs. Lincoln---person%1:03:00:: screamed .
There was no mistaking---mistaking%1:10:00:: that scream---scream%1:10:00:: .
Yet this scream---scream%1:10:00:: had a different note---note%1:10:05:: in it .
That absence---absence%1:26:00:: of an urgent self-indulgence---self-indulgence%1:07:00:: dashed them awake like a pail---pail%1:06:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: .
Clara Harris---person%1:03:00:: , one of the guests---guest%1:18:00:: in the box---box%1:06:02:: , stood up and demanded water---water%1:27:00:: .
Her action---action%1:04:02:: was involuntary .
When something unexpected happened , one always asked for water---water%1:27:00:: if one were a woman---woman%1:18:00:: , brandy---brandy%1:13:00:: if one were a man---man%1:18:00:: .
Mrs. Lincoln---person%1:03:00:: screamed again .
In the Presidential box---box%1:06:02:: someone---someone%1:03:00:: leaned over the balustrade---balustrade%1:06:00:: and yelled : `` He has shot the President---person%1:03:00:: '' !
On the stage---stage%1:06:00:: , Harry Hawk---person%1:03:00:: began to weep .
Laura Keene---person%1:03:00:: brushed by him with the glass---glass%1:06:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: .
The crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: began to move .
In Washington City---location%1:03:00:: everyone lived in a bubble---bubble%1:17:00:: of plots---plot%1:09:00:: , and one death---death%1:11:00:: might attract another .
The beehive---beehive%1:06:01:: voices---voice%1:10:00:: , for no one could bear silence---silence%1:07:00:: , drowned out the sound---sound%1:09:00:: of Mrs. Lincoln---person%1:03:00:: 's weeping---weeping%1:04:00:: .
At the rear---rear%1:15:01:: of the auditorium---auditorium%1:06:00:: , upstairs , some men---man%1:18:00:: tried to push open the door---door%1:06:00:: to the box---box%1:06:02:: corridor---corridor%1:06:00:: .
A Dr. Charles Taft---person%1:03:00:: clambered up on the stage---stage%1:06:00:: and got the actors---actor%1:18:00:: to hoist him up to the box---box%1:06:02:: .
In the audience---audience%1:14:00:: a man---man%1:18:00:: named Ferguson---person%1:03:00:: lost his head---head%1:09:00:: and tried to rescue a little girl---girl%1:18:02:: from the mob---mob%1:14:00:: , on the same principle---principle%1:10:00:: which had led Miss Harris---person%1:03:00:: to demand---demand%1:10:00:: water---water%1:27:00:: .
Someone---someone%1:03:00:: opened the corridor---corridor%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:00:: from the inside---inside%1:15:00:: , and called for a doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: .
Somehow Dr. Charles Leale---person%1:03:00:: was forced through the mob---mob%1:14:00:: and squeezed out into the dingy corridor---corridor%1:06:00:: .
He went straight to the Presidential box---box%1:06:02:: .
As usual , Mrs. Lincoln---person%1:03:00:: had lost her head---head%1:09:00:: , but nobody---nobody%1:18:00:: blamed her for doing so now .
There was a little blood---blood%1:08:00:: on the hem---hem%1:06:00:: of her dress---dress%1:06:00:: , for the assassin---assassin%1:18:00:: had slashed Miss Harris---person%1:03:00:: 's companion---companion%1:18:00:: , Major Rathbone---person%1:03:00:: , with a knife---knife%1:06:00:: .
Rathbone---person%1:03:00:: said he was bleeding to death---death%1:26:00:: .
By the look---look%1:07:00:: of him he was n't that far gone .
Some experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: are composed of repetitions---repetition%1:11:00:: of independent trials---trial%1:04:00:: , each with two possible outcomes---outcome%1:19:00:: .
The binomial---binomial_distribution%1:09:00:: probability---probability%1:07:01:: distribution may describe the variation---variation%1:11:01:: that occurs from one set---set%1:14:00:: of trials---trial%1:04:00:: of such a binomial experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: to another .
We devote a chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: to the binomial distribution---binomial_distribution%1:09:00:: not only because it is a mathematical model---model%1:09:00:: for an enormous variety---variety%1:14:01:: of real life---real_life%1:09:00:: phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: , but also because it has important properties---property%1:07:00:: that recur in many other probability---probability%1:07:01:: models---model%1:09:00:: .
We begin with a few examples---example%1:09:00:: of binomial experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: .
A trained marksman---marksman%1:18:00:: shooting five rounds---round%1:06:01:: at a target---target%1:10:00:: , all under practically the same conditions---condition%1:26:00:: , may hit the bull's-eye---bull's_eye%1:15:00:: from 0 to 5 times---time%1:11:00:: .
In repeated sets---set%1:14:00:: of five shots---shot%1:04:00:: his numbers---number%1:07:00:: of bull's-eyes---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: vary .
What can we say of the probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: of the different possible numbers---number%1:07:00:: of bull's-eyes---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: ?
In litters---litter%1:14:00:: of eight mice---mouse%1:05:00:: from similar parents---parent%1:18:00:: , the number---number%1:07:00:: of mice---mouse%1:05:00:: with straight instead of wavy hair---hair%1:08:00:: is an integer---integer%1:23:00:: from 0---0%1:23:00:: to 8---8%1:23:00:: .
What probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: should be attached to these possible outcomes---outcome%1:11:00:: ?
When three dice---dice%1:06:00:: are tossed repeatedly , what is the probability---probability%1:07:01:: that the number---number%1:07:00:: of aces---ace%1:23:00:: is 0---0%1:23:00:: ( or 1---1%1:23:00:: , or 2---2%1:23:00:: , or 3---3%1:23:00:: ) ?
More generally , suppose that an experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: consists of a number---number%1:07:00:: of independent trials---trial%1:04:00:: , that each trial---trial%1:04:00:: results in either a `` success---success%1:11:00:: '' or a `` non success---success%1:11:00:: '' ( `` failure---failure%1:11:00:: '' ) , and that the probability---probability%1:07:01:: of success---success%1:11:00:: remains constant from trial---trial%1:04:00:: to trial---trial%1:04:00:: .
In the examples---example%1:09:00:: above , the occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: of a bull's-eye---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: , a straight haired mouse---mouse%1:05:00:: , or an ace---ace%1:23:00:: could be called a `` success---success%1:11:00:: '' .
In general , any outcome---outcome%1:11:00:: we choose may be labeled `` success---success%1:11:00:: '' .
The major question---question%1:10:01:: in this chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: is : What is the probability---probability%1:07:01:: of exactly x successes---success%1:11:00:: in n trials---trial%1:04:00:: ?
In Chapters---chapter%1:10:00:: 3 and 4 we answered questions---question%1:10:03:: like those in the examples---example%1:09:00:: , usually by counting points---point%1:09:00:: in a sample---sample%1:09:01:: space---space%1:15:00:: .
Fortunately , a general formula---formula%1:10:00:: of wide applicability---applicability%1:24:00:: solves all problems---problem%1:10:00:: of this kind---kind%1:09:00:: .
Before deriving this formula---formula%1:10:00:: , we explain what we mean by `` problems---problem%1:10:00:: of this kind---kind%1:09:00:: '' .
Experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: are often composed of several identical trials---trial%1:04:00:: , and sometimes experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: themselves are repeated .
In the marksmanship---marksmanship%1:09:00:: example---example%1:09:00:: , a trial---trial%1:04:00:: consists of `` one round---round%1:06:01:: shot at a target---target%1:10:00:: '' with outcome---outcome%1:11:00:: either one bull's-eye---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: ( success---success%1:11:00:: ) or none ( failure---failure%1:11:00:: ) .
Further , an experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: might consist of five rounds---round%1:06:01:: , and several sets---set%1:14:00:: of five rounds---round%1:06:01:: might be regarded as a super experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: composed of several repetitions---repetition%1:11:00:: of the five round---round%1:06:01:: experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: .
If three dice---dice%1:06:00:: are tossed , a trial---trial%1:04:00:: is one toss---toss%1:04:01:: of one die---die%1:06:00:: and the experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: is composed of three trials---trial%1:04:00:: .
Or , what amounts to the same thing---thing%1:26:00:: , if one die---die%1:06:00:: is tossed three times---time%1:11:00:: , each toss---toss%1:04:01:: is a trial---trial%1:04:00:: , and the three tosses---toss%1:04:01:: form the experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: .
Mathematically , we shall not distinguish the experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: of three dice---dice%1:06:00:: tossed once from that of one die---die%1:06:00:: tossed three times---time%1:11:00:: .
These examples---example%1:09:00:: are illustrative of the use---use%1:04:00:: of the words---word%1:10:00:: `` trial---trial%1:04:00:: '' and `` experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: '' as they are used in this chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: , but they are quite flexible words---word%1:10:00:: and it is well not to restrict them too narrowly .
Ten students---student%1:18:00:: act as managers---manager%1:18:01:: for a high-school---high_school%1:14:00:: football team---football_team%1:14:00:: , and of these managers---manager%1:18:01:: a proportion---proportion%1:24:00:: p are licensed drivers---driver%1:18:00:: .
Each Friday---friday%1:28:00:: one manager---manager%1:18:01:: is chosen by lot---lot%1:06:00:: to stay late and load the equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: on a truck---truck%1:06:00:: .
On three Fridays---friday%1:28:00:: the coach---coach%1:18:01:: has needed a driver---driver%1:18:00:: .
Considering only these Fridays---friday%1:28:00:: , what is the probability---probability%1:07:01:: that the coach---coach%1:18:01:: had drivers---driver%1:18:00:: all 3 times---time%1:11:00:: ?
Exactly 2 times---time%1:11:00:: ?
1 time---time%1:11:00:: ?
0 time---time%1:11:00:: ?
Note that there are 3 trials---trial%1:04:00:: of interest---interest%1:09:00:: .
Each trial---trial%1:04:00:: consists of choosing a student---student%1:18:00:: manager---manager%1:18:01:: at random .
The 2 possible outcomes---outcome%1:11:00:: on each trial---trial%1:04:00:: are `` driver---driver%1:18:00:: '' or `` nondriver---nondriver%1:18:00:: '' .
Since the choice---choice%1:04:00:: is by lot---lot%1:06:00:: each week , the outcomes---outcome%1:11:00:: of different trials---trial%1:04:00:: are independent .
The managers---manager%1:18:01:: stay the same , so that * * f is the same for all weeks---week%1:28:00:: .
We now generalize these ideas---idea%1:09:00:: for general binomial experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: .
For an experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: to qualify as a binomial experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: , it must have four properties---property%1:07:00:: : ( 1 ) there must be a fixed number---number%1:07:00:: of trials---trial%1:04:00:: , ( 2 ) each trial---trial%1:04:00:: must result in a `` success---success%1:11:00:: '' or a `` failure---failure%1:11:00:: '' ( a binomial trial---trial%1:04:00:: ) , ( 3 ) all trials---trial%1:04:00:: must have identical probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: of success---success%1:11:00:: , ( 4 ) the trials---trial%1:04:00:: must be independent of each other .
Below we use our earlier examples---example%1:09:00:: to describe and illustrate these four properties---property%1:07:00:: .
We also give , for each property---property%1:07:00:: , an example---example%1:09:00:: where the property---property%1:07:00:: is absent .
The language---language%1:10:00:: and notation---notation%1:10:00:: introduced are standard throughout the chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: .
For the marksman---marksman%1:18:00:: , we study sets---set%1:14:00:: of five shots---shot%1:04:00:: ( * * f ) ; for the mice---mouse%1:05:00:: , we restrict attention---attention%1:09:00:: to litters---litter%1:14:00:: of eight ( * * f ) ; and for the aces---ace%1:23:00:: , we toss three dice---dice%1:06:00:: ( * * f ) .
Toss a die---die%1:06:00:: until an ace---ace%1:23:00:: appears .
Here the number---number%1:07:00:: of trials---trial%1:04:00:: is a random variable---random_variable%1:09:00:: , not a fixed number---number%1:07:00:: .
Each of the n trials---trial%1:04:00:: is either a success---success%1:11:00:: or a failure---failure%1:11:00:: .
`` Success---success%1:11:00:: '' and `` failure---failure%1:11:00:: '' are just convenient labels---label%1:10:01:: for the two categories---category%1:14:00:: of outcomes---outcome%1:11:00:: when we talk about binomial trials---trial%1:04:00:: in general .
These words---word%1:10:00:: are more expressive than labels---label%1:10:01:: like `` A '' and `` not - A '' .
It is natural from the marksman---marksman%1:18:00:: 's viewpoint---viewpoint%1:09:00:: to call a bull's-eye---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: a success---success%1:11:00:: , but in the mice---mouse%1:05:00:: example---example%1:09:00:: it is arbitrary which category---category%1:14:00:: corresponds to straight hair---hair%1:08:00:: in a mouse---mouse%1:05:00:: .
The word---word%1:10:00:: `` binomial---binomial%1:09:00:: '' means `` of two names---name%1:10:00:: '' or `` of two terms---term%1:09:00:: '' , and both usages---usage%1:04:00:: apply in our work---work%1:06:00:: : the first to the names---name%1:10:00:: of the two outcomes---outcome%1:11:00:: of a binomial trial---trial%1:04:00:: , and the second to the terms---term%1:09:00:: p and * * f that represent the probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: of `` success---success%1:11:00:: '' and `` failure---failure%1:11:00:: '' .
Sometimes when there are many outcomes---outcome%1:11:00:: for a single trial---trial%1:04:00:: , we group these outcomes---outcome%1:11:00:: into two classes---class%1:14:00:: , as in the example---example%1:09:00:: of the die---die%1:06:00:: , where we have arbitrarily constructed the classes---class%1:14:00:: `` ace---ace%1:23:00:: '' and `` not ace---ace%1:23:00:: '' .
We classify mice---mouse%1:05:00:: as `` straight haired '' or `` wavy haired '' , but a hairless mouse---mouse%1:05:00:: appears .
We can escape from such a difficulty---difficulty%1:09:02:: by ruling out the animal---animal%1:03:00:: as not constituting a trial---trial%1:04:00:: , but such a solution---solution%1:10:00:: is not always satisfactory .
Each die---die%1:06:00:: has probability---probability%1:07:01:: * * f of producing an ace---ace%1:23:00:: ; the marksman---marksman%1:18:00:: has some probability---probability%1:07:01:: p , perhaps 0.1 , of making a bull's-eye---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: .
Note that we need not know the value---value%1:09:00:: of p , for the experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: to be binomial .
During a round---round%1:28:01:: of target practice---target_practice%1:04:00:: the sun---sun%1:17:00:: comes from behind a cloud---cloud%1:17:00:: and dazzles the marksman---marksman%1:18:00:: , lowering his chance---chance%1:26:00:: of a bull's-eye---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: .
Strictly speaking , this means that the probability---probability%1:07:01:: for each possible outcome---outcome%1:11:00:: of the experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: can be computed by multiplying together the probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: of the possible outcomes---outcome%1:11:00:: of the single binomial trials---trial%1:04:00:: .
Thus in the three dice---dice%1:06:00:: example---example%1:09:00:: * * f , * * f , and the independence---independence%1:26:00:: assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: implies that the probability---probability%1:07:01:: that the three dice---dice%1:06:00:: fall ace---ace%1:23:00:: , not ace---ace%1:23:00:: , ace---ace%1:23:00:: in that order---order%1:14:00:: is ( 1 6 ) ( 5 6 ) ( 1 6 ) .
Experimentally , we expect independence---independence%1:26:00:: when the trials---trial%1:04:00:: have nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to do with one another .
A family---family%1:14:02:: of five plans to go together either to the beach---beach%1:17:00:: or to the mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: , and a coin---coin%1:21:02:: is tossed to decide .
We want to know the number---number%1:07:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: going to the mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: .
When this experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: is viewed as composed of five binomial trials---trial%1:04:00:: , one for each member---member%1:18:00:: of the family---family%1:14:02:: , the outcomes---outcome%1:11:00:: of the trials---trial%1:04:00:: are obviously not independent .
Indeed , the experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: is better viewed as consisting of one binomial trial---trial%1:04:00:: for the entire family---family%1:14:02:: .
The following is a less extreme example---example%1:09:00:: of dependence---dependence%1:26:00:: .
Consider couples---couple%1:14:00:: visiting an art---art%1:06:00:: museum---museum%1:06:00:: .
Each person---person%1:03:00:: votes for one of a pair---pair%1:14:01:: of pictures---picture%1:06:01:: to receive a popular prize---prize%1:21:00:: .
Voting for one picture---picture%1:06:01:: may be called `` success---success%1:11:00:: '' , for the other `` failure---failure%1:11:00:: '' .
An experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: consists of the voting---voting%1:04:00:: of one couple---couple%1:14:00:: , or two trials---trial%1:04:00:: .
In repetitions---repetition%1:04:00:: of the experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: from couple---couple%1:14:00:: to couple---couple%1:14:00:: , the votes---vote%1:04:00:: of the two persons---person%1:03:00:: in a couple---couple%1:14:00:: probably agree more often than independence---independence%1:26:00:: would imply , because couples---couple%1:14:00:: who visit the museum---museum%1:06:00:: together are more likely to have similar tastes---taste%1:12:02:: than are a random pair---pair%1:14:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: drawn from the entire population---population%1:09:00:: of visitors---visitor%1:18:00:: .
Table---table%1:14:00:: 7 - 1 illustrates the point---point%1:10:01:: .
The table---table%1:14:00:: shows that 0.6 of the boys---boy%1:18:00:: and 0.6 of the girls---girl%1:18:02:: vote for picture---picture%1:06:01:: A .
Therefore , under independent voting---voting%1:04:00:: , * * f or 0.36 of the couples---couple%1:14:00:: would cast two votes---vote%1:04:00:: for picture---picture%1:06:01:: A , and * * f or 0.16 would cast two votes---vote%1:04:00:: for picture---picture%1:06:01:: B .
Thus in independent voting---voting%1:04:00:: , * * f or 0.52 of the couples---couple%1:14:00:: would agree .
But Table---table%1:14:00:: 7 - 1 shows that * * f or 0.70 agree , too many for independent voting---voting%1:04:00:: .
Each performance---performance%1:04:00:: of an n-trial binomial experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: results in some whole number---whole_number%1:23:00:: from 0---0%1:23:00:: through n as the value---value%1:09:00:: of the random variable---random_variable%1:09:00:: X , where * * f .
We want to study the probability---probability%1:07:01:: function---function%1:24:00:: of this random variable---random_variable%1:09:00:: .
For example , we are interested in the number---number%1:07:00:: of bull's-eyes---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: , not which shots---shot%1:04:00:: were bull's-eyes---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: .
A binomial experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: can produce random variables---random_variable%1:09:00:: other than the number---number%1:07:00:: of successes---success%1:11:00:: .
For example , the marksman---marksman%1:18:00:: gets 5 shots---shot%1:04:00:: , but we take his score---score%1:09:00:: to be the number---number%1:07:00:: of shots---shot%1:04:00:: before his first bull's-eye---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: , that is , 0---0%1:23:00:: , 1---1%1:23:00:: , 2---2%1:23:00:: , 3---3%1:23:00:: , 4---4%1:23:00:: ( or 5---5%1:23:00:: , if he gets no bull's-eye---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: ) .
Thus we do not score the number---number%1:07:00:: of bull's-eyes---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: , and the random variable---random_variable%1:09:00:: is not the number---number%1:07:00:: of successes---success%1:11:00:: .
The constancy---constancy%1:07:00:: of p and the independence---independence%1:26:00:: are the conditions---condition%1:10:01:: most likely to give trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: in practice .
Obviously , very slight changes---change%1:24:00:: in p do not change the probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: much , and a slight lack---lack%1:26:00:: of independence---independence%1:26:00:: may not make an appreciable difference---difference%1:11:00:: .
( For instance , see Example---example%1:09:02:: 2 of Section---section%1:10:00:: 5 - 5 , on red cards---card%1:06:00:: in hands---hand%1:14:00:: of 5 . )
On the other hand , even when the binomial model---model%1:09:00:: does not describe well the physical phenomenon---physical_phenomenon%1:19:00:: being studied , the binomial model---model%1:09:00:: may still be used as a baseline---baseline%1:24:00:: for comparative purposes---purpose%1:07:00:: ; that is , we may discuss the phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: in terms of its departures---departure%1:11:01:: from the binomial model---model%1:09:00:: .
A binomial experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: consists of * * f independent binomial trials---trial%1:04:00:: , all with the same probability---probability%1:07:01:: * * f of yielding a success---success%1:11:00:: .
The outcome---outcome%1:11:00:: of the experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: is X successes---success%1:11:00:: .
The random variable---random_variable%1:09:00:: X takes the values---value%1:09:00:: * * f with probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: * * f or , more briefly * * f .
We shall find a formula---formula%1:10:00:: for the probability---probability%1:07:01:: of exactly x successes---success%1:11:00:: for given values---value%1:09:00:: of p and n .
When each number---number%1:07:00:: of successes---success%1:11:00:: x is paired with its probability---probability%1:07:01:: of occurrence---occurrence%1:11:00:: * * f , the set---set%1:14:02:: of pairs---pair%1:14:01:: * * f , is a probability---probability%1:07:01:: function---function%1:24:00:: called a binomial distribution---binomial_distribution%1:09:00:: .
The choice---choice%1:09:00:: of p and n determines the binomial distribution---binomial_distribution%1:09:00:: uniquely , and different choices---choice%1:09:00:: always produce different distributions---distribution%1:09:00:: ( except when * * f ; then the number---number%1:07:00:: of successes---success%1:11:00:: is always 0---0%1:23:00:: ) .
The set---set%1:14:00:: of all binomial distributions---binomial_distribution%1:09:00:: is called the family---family%1:14:02:: of binomial distributions---binomial_distribution%1:09:00:: , but in general discussions---discussion%1:10:02:: this expression---expression%1:10:03:: is often shortened to `` the binomial distribution---binomial_distribution%1:09:00:: '' , or even `` the binomial '' when the context---context%1:10:00:: is clear .
Binomial distributions---binomial_distribution%1:09:00:: were treated by James Bernoulli---person%1:03:00:: about 1700 , and for this reason---reason%1:16:00:: binomial trials---trial%1:04:00:: are sometimes called Bernoulli---person%1:03:00:: trials---trial%1:04:00:: .
Each binomial trial---trial%1:04:00:: of a binomial experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: produces either 0 or 1 success---success%1:11:00:: .
Therefore each binomial trial---trial%1:04:00:: can be thought of as producing a value---value%1:09:00:: of a random variable---random_variable%1:09:00:: associated with that trial---trial%1:04:00:: and taking the values---value%1:09:00:: 0---0%1:23:00:: and 1---1%1:23:00:: , with probabilities---probability%1:07:01:: q and p respectively .
The several trials---trial%1:04:00:: of a binomial experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: produce a new random variable---random_variable%1:09:00:: X , the total number---number%1:07:00:: of successes---success%1:11:00:: , which is just the sum---sum%1:09:01:: of the random variables---random_variable%1:09:00:: associated with the single trials---trial%1:04:00:: .
The marksman---marksman%1:18:00:: gets two bull's-eyes---bull's_eye%1:04:00:: , one on his third shot---shot%1:04:00:: and one on his fifth .
The numbers---number%1:07:00:: of successes---success%1:11:00:: on the five individual shots---shot%1:04:00:: are , then , 0---0%1:23:00:: , 0---0%1:23:00:: , 1---1%1:23:00:: , 0---0%1:23:00:: , 1---1%1:23:00:: .
The number---number%1:07:00:: of successes---success%1:11:00:: on each shot---shot%1:04:00:: is a value---value%1:09:00:: of a random variable---random_variable%1:09:00:: that has values---value%1:09:00:: 0---0%1:23:00:: or 1---1%1:23:00:: , and there are 5 such random variables---random_variable%1:09:00:: here .
Their sum---sum%1:09:01:: is X , the total number---number%1:07:00:: of successes---success%1:11:00:: , which in this experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: has the value---value%1:09:00:: * * f .
The death---death%1:11:00:: of a man---man%1:18:04:: is unique , and yet it is universal .
The straight line---straight_line%1:25:00:: would symbolize its uniqueness---uniqueness%1:07:00:: , the circle---circle%1:25:00:: its universality---universality%1:07:00:: .
But how can one figure---figure%1:25:00:: symbolize both ?
Christianity---christianity%1:09:00:: declares that in the life---life%1:26:02:: and death---death%1:28:00:: of Jesus Christ---jesus_christ%1:18:00:: the unique and the universal concur .
Perhaps no church father---church_father%1:18:00:: saw this concurrence---concurrence%1:04:00:: of the unique and the universal as clearly , or formulated it as precisely , as Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: .
To be the Savior---savior%1:18:01:: and the Lord---lord%1:18:02:: , Jesus Christ---jesus_christ%1:18:00:: has to be a historical individual---individual%1:03:00:: with a biography---biography%1:10:00:: all his own ; he dare not be a cosmic aeon---aeon%1:18:00:: that swoops to earth---earth%1:15:00:: for a while but never identifies itself with man 's history---history%1:28:00:: .
Yet this utterly individual---individual%1:03:00:: historical person---person%1:03:00:: must also contain within himself the common history---history%1:28:00:: of mankind .
His history---history%1:28:00:: is his alone , yet each man---man%1:18:04:: must recognize his own history---history%1:28:00:: in it .
His death---death%1:11:00:: is his alone , yet each man---man%1:18:04:: can see his own death---death%1:11:00:: in the crucifixion---crucifixion%1:04:00:: of Jesus---jesus%1:18:00:: .
Each man---man%1:18:04:: can identify himself with the history---history%1:28:00:: and the death---death%1:11:00:: of Jesus Christ---jesus_christ%1:18:00:: because Jesus Christ---jesus_christ%1:18:00:: has identified himself with human history---history%1:28:00:: and human death---human_death%1:11:00:: , coming as the head---head%1:18:00:: of a new humanity .
Not a circle---circle%1:25:00:: , then , nor a straight line---straight_line%1:25:00:: , but a spiral---spiral%1:25:00:: represents the shape---shape%1:09:01:: of death---death%1:19:00:: as Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: sees it ; for a spiral---spiral%1:25:00:: has motion---motion%1:26:00:: as well as recurrence---recurrence%1:11:00:: .
As represented by a spiral---spiral%1:25:00:: , history---history%1:28:00:: may , in some sense , be said to repeat itself ; yet each historical event---event%1:03:00:: remains unique .
Christ---christ%1:18:00:: is both unique and universal .
The first turn---turn%1:25:00:: of the spiral---spiral%1:25:00:: is the primeval history---history%1:28:00:: of humanity in Adam---adam%1:18:00:: .
As Origen---person%1:03:00:: interprets the end---end%1:11:00:: of history---history%1:28:02:: on the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of its beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: , so Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: portrays the story---story%1:10:03:: of Adam---adam%1:18:00:: on the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of the story---story%1:10:03:: of Christ---christ%1:18:00:: .
`` Whence , then , comes the substance---substance%1:03:00:: of the first man---man%1:18:00:: ?
From God---god%1:18:00:: 's Will---will%1:09:01:: and Wisdom---wisdom%1:07:00:: , and from virgin earth---earth%1:27:00:: .
For ' God---god%1:18:00:: had not rained ' , says the Scripture---scripture%1:10:00:: , before man was made , ' and there was no man to till the earth---earth%1:27:00:: ' .
From this earth---earth%1:27:00:: , then , while it was still virgin God---god%1:18:00:: took dust---dust%1:27:00:: and fashioned the man---man%1:18:00:: , the beginning---beginning%1:28:00:: of humanity '' .
Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: does not regard Adam---adam%1:18:00:: and Eve---eve%1:18:00:: merely as private individuals---individual%1:03:00:: , but as universal human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: , who were and are all of humanity .
Adam---adam%1:18:00:: and Eve---eve%1:18:00:: were perfect , not in the sense---sense%1:10:00:: that they possessed perfection---perfection%1:26:00:: , but in the sense---sense%1:10:00:: that they were capable of development---development%1:22:02:: toward perfection---perfection%1:26:00:: .
They were , in fact , children---child%1:18:00:: .
Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: does not claim pre-existence---preexistence%1:26:00:: for the human soul---soul%1:18:00:: ; therefore there is no need---need%1:26:00:: for him , as there is for Origen---person%1:03:00:: , to identify existence---existence%1:26:00:: itself with the fall---fall%1:11:03:: .
Existence---existence%1:26:00:: is created and willed by God---god%1:18:00:: and is not the consequence---consequence%1:19:00:: of a pre-existent rebellion---rebellion%1:04:00:: or of a cosmic descent---descent%1:11:00:: from eternity---eternity%1:26:00:: into history---history%1:28:00:: .
Historical existence---existence%1:26:00:: is a created good---good%1:07:02:: .
The biblical symbol---symbol%1:10:00:: for this affirmation---affirmation%1:10:00:: is expressed in the words---word%1:10:00:: : `` So God---god%1:18:00:: created man in his own image---image%1:07:00:: ; in the similitude---similitude%1:07:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: he created him '' .
There are some passages---passage%1:10:00:: in the writings---writings%1:10:01:: of Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: where the image---image%1:07:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: and the similitude---similitude%1:07:00:: are sharply distinguished , so most notably in the statement---statement%1:10:00:: : `` If the [ Holy---holy_spirit%1:18:00:: ] Spirit is absent from the soul---soul%1:18:00:: , such a man---man%1:18:04:: is indeed of an animal nature---nature%1:07:02:: ; and , being left carnal , he will be an imperfect being---being%1:03:00:: , possessing the image---image%1:07:00:: [ of God---god%1:18:00:: ] in his formation---formation%1:06:00:: , but not receiving the similitude---similitude%1:07:00:: [ of God---god%1:18:00:: ] through the Spirit---holy_spirit%1:18:00:: '' .
Thus the image---image%1:07:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: is that which makes a man---man%1:18:04:: a man---man%1:18:04:: and not an oyster---oyster%1:05:00:: ; the similitude---similitude%1:07:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: , by contrast---contrast%1:04:00:: , is that which makes a man---man%1:18:04:: a child---child%1:18:01:: of God---god%1:18:00:: and not merely a rational creature---creature%1:03:00:: .
Recent research---research%1:04:00:: on Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: , however , makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction---distinction%1:09:00:: .
He does not mean to say that Adam---adam%1:18:00:: lost the similitude---similitude%1:07:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: and his immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: through the fall---fall%1:11:03:: ; for he was created not exactly immortal , nor yet exactly mortal , but capable of immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: as well as of mortality---mortality%1:07:00:: .
Therefore Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: describes man 's creation---creation%1:11:00:: as follows :
`` So that the man---man%1:18:04:: should not have thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: of grandeur---grandeur%1:07:02:: , and become lifted up , as if he had no lord---lord%1:18:01:: , because of the dominion---dominion%1:26:00:: that had been given to him , and the freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: , fall into sin---sin%1:07:00:: against God---god%1:18:00:: his Creator---creator%1:18:01:: , overstepping his bounds , and take up an attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of self-conceited arrogance---arrogance%1:07:00:: towards God---god%1:18:00:: , a law---law%1:14:00:: was given him by God---god%1:18:00:: , that he might know that he had for lord---lord%1:18:01:: the lord---lord%1:18:02:: of all .
And He laid down for him certain conditions---condition%1:10:01:: : so that , if he kept the command---command%1:10:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: , then he would always remain as he was , that is , immortal ; but if he did not , he would become mortal , melting into earth---earth%1:27:00:: , whence his frame---frame%1:08:01:: had been taken '' .
These conditions---condition%1:10:01:: man did not keep , and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result---result%1:19:00:: .
There is no justification---justification%1:09:00:: for systematizing the random statements---statement%1:10:02:: of Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: about the image---image%1:07:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: beyond this , nor for reading into his imprecise usage---usage%1:04:00:: the later theological distinction---distinction%1:09:00:: between the image---image%1:07:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: ( humanity---humanity%1:07:02:: ) and the similitude---similitude%1:07:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: ( immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: ) .
Man was created with the capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: for immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: , but the devil---devil%1:18:02:: 's promise---promise%1:10:00:: of immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: in exchange---exchange%1:04:02:: for disobedience---disobedience%1:04:00:: cost Adam---adam%1:18:00:: his immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: .
He was , in the words---words%1:10:03:: of Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: , `` beguiled by another under the pretext---pretext%1:10:00:: of immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: '' .
The true way---way%1:04:01:: to immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: lay through obedience---obedience%1:04:00:: , but man did not believe this .
`` Eve---eve%1:18:00:: was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin---virgin%1:18:00:: .
And even as she , having indeed a husband---husband%1:18:00:: , Adam---adam%1:18:00:: , but being nevertheless as yet a virgin---virgin%1:18:00:: , having become disobedient , was made the cause---cause%1:10:00:: of death---death%1:19:00:: , both to herself and to the entire human race ; so also did Mary---mary%1:18:00:: , having a man---man%1:18:00:: betrothed [ to her ] , and being nevertheless a virgin---virgin%1:18:00:: , by yielding obedience---obedience%1:04:00:: , become the cause---cause%1:10:00:: of salvation---salvation%1:04:00:: , both to herself and the whole human race '' .
Because he interprets the primitive state---state%1:03:00:: of man as one of mere potentiality---potentiality%1:26:00:: or capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: and believes that Adam---adam%1:18:00:: and Eve---eve%1:18:00:: were created as children---child%1:18:00:: , Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience---disobedience%1:04:00:: as being `` due , no doubt , to carelessness---carelessness%1:04:00:: , but still wicked '' .
His interpretation---interpretation%1:09:01:: of the beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: on the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of the end---end%1:11:00:: prompts him to draw these parallels---parallel%1:07:00:: between the Virgin---virgin%1:18:00:: Eve---eve%1:18:00:: and the Virgin---virgin%1:18:00:: Mary---mary%1:18:00:: .
That parallelism---parallelism%1:07:00:: affects his picture---picture%1:09:00:: of man 's disobedience---disobedience%1:04:00:: too ; for as it was Christ---christ%1:18:00:: , the Word of God---word_of_god%1:11:00:: , who came to rescue man , so it was disobedience---disobedience%1:04:00:: to the word of God---word_of_god%1:11:00:: in the beginning that brought death---death%1:19:00:: into the world---world%1:17:01:: , and all our woe---woe%1:26:00:: .
With this act---act%1:03:00:: of disobedience---disobedience%1:04:00:: , and not with the inception---inception%1:11:00:: of his individual existence---existence%1:26:00:: , man began the downward circuit---circuit%1:04:00:: on the spiral---spiral%1:25:00:: of history---history%1:28:00:: , descending from the created capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: for immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: to an inescapable mortality---mortality%1:07:00:: .
At the nadir---nadir%1:26:00:: of that circuit---circuit%1:04:00:: is death---death%1:19:00:: .
`` Along with the fruit---fruit%1:20:00:: they did also fall under the power---power%1:07:00:: of death---death%1:19:00:: , because they did eat in disobedience---disobedience%1:04:00:: ; and disobedience---disobedience%1:04:00:: to God---god%1:18:00:: entails death---death%1:11:00:: .
Wherefore , as they became forfeit to death---death%1:19:00:: , from that [ moment---moment%1:28:00:: ] they were handed over to it '' .
This leads Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: to the somewhat startling notion---notion%1:09:02:: that Adam---adam%1:18:00:: and Eve---eve%1:18:00:: died on the same day---day%1:28:00:: that they disobeyed , namely , on a Friday---friday%1:28:00:: , as a parallel---parallel%1:07:00:: to the death---death%1:11:00:: of Christ---christ%1:18:00:: on Good Friday---good_friday%1:28:00:: ; he sees a parallel---parallel%1:07:00:: also to the Jewish day---day%1:28:01:: of preparation---preparation%1:04:02:: for the Sabbath---sabbath%1:28:00:: .
In any case , though they had been promised immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: if they ate of the tree---tree%1:20:00:: , they obtained mortality---mortality%1:07:00:: instead .
The wages---wages%1:11:00:: of sin---sin%1:04:00:: is death---death%1:19:00:: .
Man---man%1:18:04:: 's life---life%1:09:00:: , originally shaped for immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: and for communion---communion%1:10:00:: with God---god%1:18:00:: , must now be conformed to the shape---shape%1:07:00:: of death---death%1:19:00:: .
Nevertheless , even at the nadir---nadir%1:26:00:: of the circuit---circuit%1:04:00:: the spiral---spiral%1:25:00:: of history---history%1:28:00:: belongs to God---god%1:18:00:: , and he still rules .
Even death---death%1:19:00:: , therefore , has a providential as well as a punitive function---function%1:07:00:: .
`` Wherefore also He [ God---god%1:18:00:: ] drove him [ man ] out of Paradise---paradise%1:15:01:: , and removed him far from the tree---tree%1:20:00:: of life---life%1:26:00:: , not because He envied him the tree---tree%1:20:00:: of life---life%1:26:00:: , as some venture to assert , but because He pitied him , [ and did not desire ] that he should continue a sinner---sinner%1:18:00:: for ever , nor that the sin---sin%1:07:00:: which surrounded him should be immortal , and evil---evil%1:07:00:: interminable and irremediable .
But He set a bound---bound%1:25:00:: to his [ state---state%1:03:00:: of ] sin---sin%1:07:00:: , by interposing death---death%1:19:00:: , and thus causing sin---sin%1:07:00:: to cease , putting an end---end%1:11:00:: to it by the dissolution---dissolution%1:22:00:: of the flesh---flesh%1:08:01:: , which should take place in the earth---earth%1:27:00:: , so that man , ceasing at length to live in sin---sin%1:07:00:: , and dying to it , might live to God---god%1:18:00:: '' .
This idea---idea%1:09:00:: , which occurs in both Tatian---person%1:03:00:: and Cyprian---person%1:03:00:: , fits especially well into the scheme---scheme%1:09:00:: of Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: ' theology---theology%1:09:00:: ; for it prepares the way---way%1:06:00:: for the passage---passage%1:04:04:: from life---life%1:26:00:: through death---death%1:26:00:: to life---life%1:26:00:: that is achieved in Christ---christ%1:18:00:: .
As man---man%1:18:04:: can live only by dying , so it was only by his dying that Christ---christ%1:18:00:: could bring many to life---life%1:26:00:: .
It is probably fair to say that the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of death---death%1:19:00:: is more profound in Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: than the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of sin---sin%1:07:00:: is .
This applies to his picture---picture%1:09:00:: of Adam---adam%1:18:00:: .
It is borne out also by the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of any developed theory---theory%1:09:01:: about how sin---sin%1:07:00:: passes from one generation---generation%1:14:00:: to the next .
It becomes most evident in his description---description%1:10:01:: of Christ---christ%1:18:00:: as the second Adam---adam%1:18:00:: , who does indeed come to destroy sin---sin%1:07:00:: , but whose work---work%1:04:00:: culminates in the achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: of immortality---immortality%1:07:00:: .
This emphasis---emphasis%1:07:00:: upon death---death%1:19:00:: rather than sin---sin%1:07:00:: as man 's fundamental problem---problem%1:26:00:: Irenaeus---person%1:03:00:: shares with many early theologians---theologian%1:18:00:: , especially the Greek---greek%1:10:00:: speaking ones .
They speak of the work---work%1:04:00:: of Christ---christ%1:18:00:: as the bestowal---bestowal%1:04:00:: of incorruptibility---incorruptibility%1:07:00:: , which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance---deliverance%1:04:00:: from time---time%1:03:00:: and history---history%1:28:02:: .
Death---death%1:19:00:: reminds man---man%1:18:04:: of his sin---sin%1:07:00:: , but it reminds him also of his transience---transience%1:07:00:: .
It represents a punishment---punishment%1:04:00:: that he knows he deserves , but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life---life%1:28:00:: within the process of time---time%1:03:00:: .
These two aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of death---death%1:19:00:: cannot be successfully separated , but they dare not be confused or identified .
The repeated efforts---effort%1:04:00:: in Christian history---history%1:28:00:: to describe death---death%1:19:00:: as altogether the consequence---consequence%1:19:00:: of human sin---sin%1:07:00:: show that these two aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of death---death%1:19:00:: cannot be separated .
Such efforts---effort%1:04:00:: almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam---adam%1:18:00:: was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older , in short , whether Adam---adam%1:18:00:: 's life---life%1:26:02:: was intended to be part---part%1:24:00:: of the process of time---time%1:03:00:: .
If it was , then it must have been God---god%1:18:00:: 's intention---intention%1:09:00:: to translate him at a certain point---point%1:28:00:: from time---time%1:03:00:: to eternity---eternity%1:28:00:: .
One night---night%1:28:00:: , so some of these theories---theory%1:09:01:: run , Adam---adam%1:18:00:: would have fallen asleep , much as he fell asleep for the creation---creation%1:11:00:: of Eve---eve%1:18:00:: ; and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal---life_eternal%1:26:00:: .
The embarrassment---embarrassment%1:11:00:: of these theories---theory%1:09:01:: over the naturalness---naturalness%1:07:00:: of death---death%1:19:00:: is an illustration---illustration%1:09:02:: of the thesis---thesis%1:10:00:: that death---death%1:19:00:: cannot be only a punishment---punishment%1:04:00:: , for some termination---termination%1:28:00:: seems necessary in a life---life%1:26:02:: that is lived within the natural order---natural_order%1:17:00:: of time---time%1:03:00:: and change---change%1:11:00:: .
On the other hand , Christian faith---faith%1:14:00:: knows that death---death%1:19:00:: is more than the natural termination---termination%1:28:00:: of temporal existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
It is the wages---wages%1:11:00:: of sin---sin%1:07:00:: , and its sting---sting%1:26:00:: is the law---law%1:09:00:: .
If this aspect---aspect%1:07:02:: of death---death%1:19:00:: as punishment---punishment%1:04:00:: is not distinguished from the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of death---death%1:19:00:: as natural termination---termination%1:28:00:: , the conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: seems inevitable that temporal existence---existence%1:26:00:: itself is a form---form%1:09:01:: of punishment---punishment%1:04:00:: rather than the state---state%1:03:00:: into which man is put by the will---will%1:09:01:: of the Creator---creator%1:18:01:: .
This seems to have been the conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: to which Origen---person%1:03:00:: was forced .
If death---death%1:19:00:: receives more than its share---share%1:04:00:: of attention---attention%1:04:01:: from the theologian---theologian%1:18:00:: and if sin---sin%1:07:00:: receives less than its share---share%1:04:00:: , the gift---gift%1:04:00:: of the life eternal---life_eternal%1:26:00:: through Christ---christ%1:18:00:: begins to look like the divinely appointed means---means%1:04:00:: of rescue---rescue%1:04:00:: from temporal , i.e. , created , existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
Such an interpretation---interpretation%1:09:01:: of death---death%1:19:00:: radically alters the Christian view---view%1:09:02:: of creation---creation%1:04:02:: ; for it teaches salvation---salvation%1:04:00:: from , not salvation---salvation%1:04:00:: in , time---time%1:03:00:: and history---history%1:28:02:: .
Because Christianity---christianity%1:09:00:: teaches not only salvation---salvation%1:04:00:: in history---history%1:28:02:: , but salvation---salvation%1:04:00:: by the history---history%1:10:00:: of Christ---christ%1:18:00:: , such an interpretation---interpretation%1:09:01:: of death---death%1:19:00:: would require a drastic revision---revision%1:04:00:: of the Christian understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of the work---work%1:04:00:: of Christ---christ%1:18:00:: .
We are trying to study a linear operator---linear_operator%1:24:00:: T on the finite dimensional space V , by decomposing T into a direct sum of operators---operator%1:24:00:: which are in some sense elementary .
We can do this through the characteristic values---value%1:09:00:: and vectors---vector%1:09:00:: of T in certain special cases---case%1:26:00:: , i.e. , when the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for T factors over the scalar field---scalar_field%1:14:00:: F into a product---product%1:09:00:: of distinct monic polynomials---monic_polynomial%1:09:00:: of degree---degree%1:09:00:: 1---1%1:23:00:: .
If we try to study T using characteristic values---value%1:09:00:: , we are confronted with two problems---problem%1:10:00:: .
First , T may not have a single characteristic value---value%1:09:00:: ; this is really a deficiency---deficiency%1:26:00:: in the scalar field---scalar_field%1:14:00:: , namely , that it is not algebraically closed .
Second , even if the characteristic polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: factors completely over F into a product---product%1:09:00:: of polynomials---polynomial%1:09:00:: of degree---degree%1:09:00:: 1---1%1:23:00:: , there may not be enough characteristic vectors---vector%1:09:00:: for T to span the space V ; this is clearly a deficiency---deficiency%1:26:00:: in T .
The second situation---situation%1:26:00:: is illustrated by the operator---operator%1:24:00:: T on * * f ( F any field---field%1:14:00:: ) represented in the standard basis---basis%1:09:00:: by * * f .
The characteristic polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for A is * * f and this is plainly also the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for A ( or for T ) .
One sees that this happens because the null space---null_space%1:14:00:: of * * f has dimension---dimension%1:07:00:: 1---1%1:23:00:: only .
On the other hand , the null space---null_space%1:14:00:: of * * f and the null space---null_space%1:14:00:: of * * f together span V , the former being the subspace---subspace%1:14:00:: spanned by * * f and the latter the subspace---subspace%1:14:00:: spanned by * * f and * * f .
This will be more or less our general method---method%1:09:00:: for the second problem---problem%1:10:00:: .
If ( remember this is an assumption---assumption%1:09:00:: ) the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for T decomposes * * f where * * f are distinct elements---element%1:06:00:: of F , then we shall show that the space V is the direct sum of the null spaces---null_space%1:14:00:: of * * f .
The diagonalizable operator---operator%1:24:00:: is the special case---case%1:11:00:: of this in which * * f for each i .
The theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: which we prove is more general than what we have described , since it works with the primary decomposition---decomposition%1:09:00:: of the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: , whether or not the primes---prime%1:23:00:: which enter are all of first degree---degree%1:09:00:: .
The reader---reader%1:18:00:: will find it helpful to think of the special case---case%1:11:00:: when the primes---prime%1:23:00:: are of degree---degree%1:09:00:: 1---1%1:23:00:: , and even more particularly , to think of the proof---proof%1:10:00:: of Theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: 10 , a special case---case%1:11:00:: of this theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: .
Let T be a linear operator---linear_operator%1:24:00:: on the finite dimensional vector---vector%1:09:00:: space V over the field---field%1:14:00:: F .
Let p be the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for T , * * f where the * * f are distinct irreducible monic polynomials---monic_polynomial%1:09:00:: over F and the * * f are positive integers---integer%1:23:00:: .
Let * * f be the null space---null_space%1:14:00:: of * * f .
Then ( a ) * * f ( b ) each * * f is invariant under T ( c ) if * * f is the operator---operator%1:24:00:: induced on * * f by T , then the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for * * f is * * f .
The idea---idea%1:09:00:: of the proof---proof%1:10:00:: is this .
If the direct sum---direct_sum%1:14:00:: decomposition---decomposition%1:09:00:: ( a ) is valid , how can we get hold---hold%1:09:00:: of the projections---projection%1:09:01:: * * f associated with the decomposition---decomposition%1:09:00:: ?
The projection---projection%1:09:01:: * * f will be the identity---identity%1:24:01:: on * * f and zero---zero%1:23:02:: on the other * * f .
We shall find a polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: * * f such that * * f is the identity---identity%1:24:01:: on * * f and is zero---zero%1:23:02:: on the other * * f , and so that * * f , etc. .
Since * * f are distinct prime polynomials---polynomial%1:09:00:: , the polynomials---polynomial%1:09:00:: * * f are relatively prime ( Theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: 8 , Chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: 4 ) .
Thus there are polynomials---polynomial%1:09:00:: * * f such that * * f .
Note also that if * * f , then * * f is divisible by the polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: p , because * * f contains each * * f as a factor---factor%1:23:00:: .
We shall show that the polynomials---polynomial%1:09:00:: * * f behave in the manner---manner%1:07:02:: described in the first paragraph---paragraph%1:10:00:: of the proof---proof%1:10:00:: .
Thus the * * f are projections---projection%1:09:01:: which correspond to some direct sum decomposition---decomposition%1:09:00:: of the space V .
We wish to show that the range of * * f is exactly the subspace---subspace%1:14:00:: * * f .
It is clear that each vector---vector%1:09:00:: in the range of * * f is in * * f for if |a is in the range of * * f , then * * f and so * * f because * * f is divisible by the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: p .
Conversely , suppose that |a is in the null space---null_space%1:14:00:: of * * f .
This completes the proof---proof%1:10:00:: of statement---statement%1:10:02:: ( a ) .
It is certainly clear that the subspaces---subspace%1:14:00:: * * f are invariant under T .
If * * f is the operator---operator%1:24:00:: induced on * * f by T , then evidently * * f , because by definition---definition%1:10:00:: * * f is 0---0%1:23:00:: on the subspace---subspace%1:14:00:: * * f .
This shows that the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for * * f divides * * f .
Conversely , let g be any polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: such that * * f .
Thus * * f is divisible by the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: p of T , i.e. , * * f divides * * f .
Hence the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for * * f is * * f .
If * * f are the projections---projection%1:09:01:: associated with the primary decomposition---decomposition%1:09:00:: of T , then each * * f is a polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: in T , and accordingly if a linear operator---linear_operator%1:24:00:: U commutes with T then U commutes with each of the * * f i.e. , each subspace---subspace%1:14:00:: * * f is invariant under U .
In the notation---notation%1:10:00:: of the proof---proof%1:10:00:: of Theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: 12 , let us take a look at the special case---case%1:11:00:: in which the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for T is a product---product%1:09:00:: of first degree---degree%1:09:00:: polynomials---polynomial%1:09:00:: , i.e. , the case---case%1:11:00:: in which each * * f is of the form---form%1:09:01:: * * f .
Now the range of * * f is the null space---null_space%1:14:00:: * * f of * * f .
By Theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: 10 , D is a diagonalizable operator---operator%1:24:00:: which we shall call the diagonalizable part---part%1:24:00:: of T .
Let us look at the operator---operator%1:24:00:: * * f .
The reader---reader%1:18:00:: should be familiar enough with projections---projection%1:09:01:: by now so that he sees that * * f and in general that * * f .
When * * f for each i , we shall have * * f , because the operator---operator%1:24:00:: * * f will then be 0---0%1:23:00:: on the range of * * f .
Let N be a linear operator---linear_operator%1:24:00:: on the vector---vector%1:09:00:: space V .
We say that N is nilpotent if there is some positive integer---integer%1:23:00:: r such that * * f .
Let T be a linear operator---linear_operator%1:24:00:: on the finite dimensional vector---vector%1:09:00:: space V over the field---field%1:14:00:: F .
Suppose that the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for T decomposes over F into a product---product%1:09:00:: of linear polynomials---polynomial%1:09:00:: .
Then there is a diagonalizable operator---operator%1:24:00:: D on V and a nilpotent operator---operator%1:24:00:: N on V such that ( a ) * * f , ( b ) * * f .
The diagonalizable operator---operator%1:24:00:: D and the nilpotent operator---operator%1:24:00:: N are uniquely determined by ( a ) and ( b ) and each of them is a polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: in T .
We have just observed that we can write * * f where D is diagonalizable and N is nilpotent , and where D and N not only commute but are polynomials---polynomial%1:09:00:: in T .
Thus D ' and N ' commute with any polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: in T ; hence they commute with D and with N .
Now we have * * f or * * f and all four of these operators---operator%1:24:00:: commute with one another .
Since N and N ' are both nilpotent and they commute , the operator---operator%1:24:00:: * * f is nilpotent ; for , using the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that N and N ' commute * * f and so when r is sufficiently large every term---term%1:09:00:: in this expression---expression%1:10:03:: for * * f will be 0---0%1:23:00:: .
( Actually , a nilpotent operator---operator%1:24:00:: on an n-dimensional space must have its nth power---power%1:10:00:: 0---0%1:23:00:: ; if we take * * f above , that will be large enough .
It then follows that * * f is large enough , but this is not obvious from the above expression---expression%1:10:03:: . )
Now * * f is a diagonalizable operator---operator%1:24:00:: which is also nilpotent .
Such an operator---operator%1:24:00:: is obviously the zero---zero%1:23:02:: operator---operator%1:24:00:: ; for since it is nilpotent , the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for this operator---operator%1:24:00:: is of the form---form%1:09:01:: * * f for some * * f ; but then since the operator---operator%1:24:00:: is diagonalizable , the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: cannot have a repeated root---root%1:23:00:: ; hence * * f and the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: is simply x , which says the operator---operator%1:24:00:: is 0---0%1:23:00:: .
Let V be a finite dimensional vector---vector%1:09:00:: space over an algebraically closed field---field%1:14:00:: F , e.g. , the field---field%1:14:00:: of complex numbers---complex_number%1:23:00:: .
Then every linear operator---linear_operator%1:24:00:: T on V can be written as the sum---sum%1:14:00:: of a diagonalizable operator---operator%1:24:00:: D and a nilpotent operator---operator%1:24:00:: N which commute .
These operators---operator%1:24:00:: D and N are unique and each is a polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: in T .
From these results , one sees that the study---study%1:09:03:: of linear operators on vector spaces over an algebraically closed field is essentially reduced to the study---study%1:09:03:: of nilpotent operators .
From these results---result%1:19:00:: , one sees that the study---study%1:04:00:: of linear operators---linear_operator%1:24:00:: on vector---vector%1:09:00:: spaces over an algebraically closed field---field%1:14:00:: is essentially reduced to the study---study%1:04:00:: of nilpotent operators---operator%1:24:00:: .
For vector---vector%1:09:00:: spaces over non algebraically closed fields---field%1:14:00:: , we still need to find some substitute---substitute%1:09:00:: for characteristic values---value%1:09:00:: and vectors---vector%1:09:00:: .
It is a very interesting fact---fact%1:10:01:: that these two problems---problem%1:10:00:: can be handled simultaneously and this is what we shall do in the next chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: .
In concluding this section---section%1:10:00:: , we should like to give an example---example%1:09:02:: which illustrates some of the ideas---idea%1:09:00:: of the primary decomposition---decomposition%1:09:00:: theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: .
We have chosen to give it at the end---end%1:09:00:: of the section---section%1:10:00:: since it deals with differential equations---differential_equation%1:10:00:: and thus is not purely linear algebra---linear_algebra%1:09:00:: .
In the primary decomposition---decomposition%1:09:00:: theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: , it is not necessary that the vector---vector%1:09:00:: space V be finite dimensional , nor is it necessary for parts---part%1:24:00:: ( a ) and ( b ) that p be the minimal polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: for T .
If T is a linear operator---linear_operator%1:24:00:: on an arbitrary vector---vector%1:09:00:: space and if there is a monic polynomial---monic_polynomial%1:09:00:: p such that * * f , then parts---part%1:24:00:: ( a ) and ( b ) of Theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: 12 are valid for T with the proof---proof%1:10:00:: which we gave .
Let n be a positive integer---integer%1:23:00:: and let V be the space of all n times continuously differentiable functions---function%1:24:00:: f on the real line---line%1:25:00:: which satisfy the differential equation---differential_equation%1:10:00:: * * f where * * f are some fixed constants---constant%1:09:00:: .
If * * f denotes the space of n times continuously differentiable functions---function%1:24:00:: , then the space V of solutions---solution%1:14:00:: of this differential equation---differential_equation%1:10:00:: is a subspace---subspace%1:14:00:: of * * f .
If D denotes the differentiation---differentiation%1:04:01:: operator---operator%1:24:00:: and p is the polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: * * f then V is the null space---null_space%1:14:00:: of the operator---operator%1:24:00:: p ( D ) , because * * f simply says * * f .
Let us now regard D as a linear operator---linear_operator%1:24:00:: on the subspace---subspace%1:14:00:: V .
If we are discussing differentiable complex valued functions---function%1:24:00:: , then * * f and V are complex vector---vector%1:09:00:: spaces , and * * f may be any complex numbers---complex_number%1:23:00:: .
We now write * * f where * * f are distinct complex numbers---complex_number%1:23:00:: .
If * * f is the null space---null_space%1:14:00:: of * * f , then Theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: 12 says that * * f .
In other words , if f satisfies the differential equation---differential_equation%1:10:00:: * * f , then f is uniquely expressible in the form---form%1:09:01:: * * f where * * f satisfies the differential equation---differential_equation%1:10:00:: * * f .
Thus , the study---study%1:09:03:: of the solutions---solution%1:14:00:: to the equation---equation%1:10:00:: * * f is reduced to the study---study%1:09:03:: of the space of solutions---solution%1:14:00:: of a differential equation---differential_equation%1:10:00:: of the form---form%1:09:01:: * * f .
This reduction---reduction%1:04:02:: has been accomplished by the general methods---method%1:09:00:: of linear algebra---linear_algebra%1:09:00:: , i.e. , by the primary decomposition---decomposition%1:09:00:: theorem---theorem%1:10:00:: .
To describe the space of solutions---solution%1:14:00:: to * * f , one must know something about differential equations---differential_equation%1:10:00:: , that is , one must know something about D other than the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that it is a linear operator---linear_operator%1:24:00:: .
It is very easy to establish by induction---induction%1:09:00:: on r that if f is in * * f then * * f that is , * * f , etc. .
A function---function%1:24:00:: g such that * * f , i.e. , * * f , must be a polynomial---polynomial%1:09:00:: function---function%1:24:00:: of degree---degree%1:09:00:: * * f or less : * * f .
Thus f satisfies * * f if and only if f has the form---form%1:09:01:: * * f .
Accordingly , the ' functions---function%1:24:00:: ' * * f span the space of solutions---solution%1:14:00:: of * * f .
Since * * f are linearly independent functions---function%1:24:00:: and the exponential function---exponential_function%1:24:00:: has no zeros---zero%1:23:02:: , these r functions---function%1:24:00:: * * f , form a basis---basis%1:09:00:: for the space of solutions---solution%1:14:00:: .
It was the first time---time%1:11:00:: any of us had laughed since the morning---morning%1:28:00:: began .
The rider---rider%1:18:00:: from Concord---concord%1:15:00:: was as good as his word---word%1:10:01:: .
He came spurring and whooping down the road---road%1:06:00:: , his horse---horse%1:05:00:: kicking up clouds---cloud%1:19:01:: of dust---dust%1:27:00:: , shouting :
By God---god%1:18:00:: , they 're a-coming , they are '' !
Solomon Chandler---person%1:03:00:: had n't misjudged the strength---strength%1:07:00:: of his lungs---lung%1:08:00:: , not at all .
I think you could have heard him a mile---mile%1:23:01:: away , and he was bursting at every seam---seam%1:06:00:: with importance---importance%1:26:00:: .
I have observed that being up on a horse---horse%1:05:00:: changes the whole character---character%1:07:01:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: , and when a very small man---man%1:18:00:: is up on a saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: , he 'd like as not prefer to eat his meals---meal%1:13:00:: there .
That 's understandable , and I appreciate the sentiment---sentiment%1:12:00:: .
As for this rider---rider%1:18:00:: , I never saw him before or afterwards and never saw him dismounted , so whether he stood tall or short in his shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: , I can n't say ; but I do know that he gave the day---day%1:28:01:: tone---tone%1:26:01:: and distinction---distinction%1:26:00:: .
The last thing---thing%1:06:00:: in the world that resembled a war---war%1:04:00:: was our line---line%1:14:01:: of farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: and storekeepers---storekeeper%1:18:00:: and mechanics---mechanic%1:18:00:: perched on top---top%1:15:00:: of a stone wall---stone_wall%1:06:00:: , and this dashing rider---rider%1:18:00:: made us feel a good deal---good_deal%1:23:00:: sharper and more alert to the situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
We came down off the wall---wall%1:06:00:: as if he had toppled all of us , and we crouched behind it .
I have heard people---people%1:14:00:: talk with contempt---contempt%1:07:00:: about the British regulars---regular%1:18:00:: , but that only proves that a lot of people---people%1:14:00:: talk about things---thing%1:09:02:: of which they are deplorably ignorant .
Whatever we felt about the redcoats---redcoat%1:18:00:: , we respected them in terms of their trade---trade%1:04:00:: , which was killing---killing%1:04:00:: ; and I know that I , myself , was nauseated with apprehension---apprehension%1:12:00:: and fear---fear%1:12:00:: and that my hands---hand%1:08:00:: were soaking wet where they held my gun---gun%1:06:00:: .
I wanted to wipe my flint---flint%1:27:00:: , but I did n't dare to , the state---state%1:03:00:: my hands---hand%1:08:00:: were in , just as I did n't dare to do anything about the priming---priming%1:04:01:: .
The gun---gun%1:06:00:: would fire or not , just as chance---chance%1:19:00:: willed .
I put a lot more trust---trust%1:09:00:: in my two legs---leg%1:08:01:: than in the gun---gun%1:06:00:: , because the most important thing---thing%1:10:00:: I had learned about war---war%1:04:00:: was that you could run away and survive to talk about it .
The gunfire---gunfire%1:04:00:: , which was so near that it seemed just a piece---piece%1:07:00:: up the road---road%1:06:00:: now , stopped for long enough to count to twenty---twenty%1:23:00:: ; and in that brief interval---interval%1:28:00:: , a redcoat---redcoat%1:18:00:: officer---officer%1:18:01:: came tearing down the road---road%1:06:00:: , whipping his horse---horse%1:05:00:: fit to kill---kill%1:04:00:: .
I do n't know whether he was after our rider---rider%1:18:00:: , who had gone by a minute---minute%1:28:00:: before , or whether he was simply scouting conditions---condition%1:26:00:: ; but when he passed us by , a musket---musket%1:06:00:: roared , and he reared his horse---horse%1:05:00:: , swung it around , and began to whip it back in the direction---direction%1:15:00:: from which he had come .
He was a fine and showy rider---rider%1:18:00:: , but his skill---skill%1:09:00:: was wasted on us .
From above me and somewhere behind me , a rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: cracked .
The redcoat---redcoat%1:18:00:: officer---officer%1:18:03:: collapsed like a punctured bolster---bolster%1:06:00:: , and the horse---horse%1:05:00:: reared and threw him from the saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: , except that one booted foot---foot%1:08:01:: caught in the stirrup---stirrup%1:06:00:: .
Half crazed by the weight---weight%1:07:00:: dragging , the dust---dust%1:27:00:: , and the heat---heat%1:07:01:: , the horse---horse%1:05:00:: leaped our wall---wall%1:06:00:: , dashing out the rider---rider%1:18:00:: 's brains---brain%1:08:00:: against it , and leaving him lying there among us - while the horse---horse%1:05:00:: crashed away through the brush---brush%1:14:00:: .
It was my initiation---initiation%1:11:00:: to war---war%1:04:00:: and the insane symphony---symphony%1:10:00:: war---war%1:04:00:: plays ; for what had happened on the common---common%1:15:00:: was only terror---terror%1:12:00:: and flight---flight%1:04:01:: ; but this grinning---grinning%1:10:00:: , broken head---head%1:08:00:: , not ten feet---foot%1:23:00:: away from me , was the sharp definition---definition%1:10:00:: of what my reality---reality%1:09:00:: had become .
And now the redcoats---redcoat%1:18:00:: were coming , and the gunfire---gunfire%1:04:00:: was a part---part%1:24:00:: of the dust cloud---dust_cloud%1:19:00:: on the road---road%1:06:00:: to the west---west%1:24:00:: of us .
I must state that the faster things---thing%1:11:00:: happened , the slower they happened ; the passage---passage%1:04:04:: and rhythm---rhythm%1:07:01:: of time---time%1:03:00:: changed , and when I remember back to what happened then , each event---event%1:03:00:: is a separate and frozen incident---incident%1:11:00:: .
In my recollection---recollection%1:09:00:: , there was a long interval---interval%1:28:00:: between the death---death%1:11:00:: of the officer---officer%1:18:03:: and the appearance---appearance%1:11:00:: of the first of the retreating redcoats---redcoat%1:18:00:: , and in that interval---interval%1:28:00:: the dust cloud---dust_cloud%1:19:00:: over the road---road%1:06:00:: seems to hover indefinitely .
Yet it could not have been more than a matter---matter%1:09:00:: of seconds---second%1:28:00:: , and then the front---front%1:15:01:: of the British army---army%1:14:00:: came into view---view%1:15:00:: .
It was only hours---hour%1:28:01:: since I had last seen them , but they had changed and I had changed .
In the very front rank---rank%1:14:00:: , two men---man%1:18:00:: were wounded and staggered along , trailing blood---blood%1:08:00:: behind them .
No drummers---drummer%1:18:00:: here , no pipers---piper%1:18:00:: , and the red coats---redcoat%1:18:00:: were covered with a fine film---film%1:06:00:: of dust---dust%1:27:00:: .
They marched with bayonets---bayonet%1:06:00:: fixed , and as fixed on their faces---face%1:08:00:: was anger---anger%1:12:00:: , fear---fear%1:12:00:: , and torment---torment%1:12:02:: .
Rank---rank%1:14:00:: after rank---rank%1:14:00:: of them came down the road---road%1:06:00:: , and the faces---face%1:08:00:: were all the same , and they walked in a sea---sea%1:17:00:: of dust---dust%1:27:00:: .
`` Committeemen---committeeman%1:18:00:: , hold your fire---fire%1:04:00:: !
Hold your fire---fire%1:04:00:: '' !
a voice---voice%1:10:00:: called , and what made it even more terrible and unreal was that the redcoat---redcoat%1:18:00:: ranks---rank%1:14:00:: never paused for an instant---instant%1:28:01:: , only some of them glancing toward the stone wall---stone_wall%1:06:00:: , from behind which the voice---voice%1:10:00:: came .
The front---front%1:15:00:: of their column---column%1:14:00:: had already passed us , when another officer---officer%1:18:03:: came riding down the side---side%1:15:02:: of the road---road%1:06:00:: , not five paces---pace%1:23:01:: from where we were .
My Cousin Simmons---person%1:03:00:: carried a musket---musket%1:06:00:: , but he had loaded it with bird shot---bird_shot%1:06:00:: , and as the officer---officer%1:18:03:: came opposite him , he rose up behind the wall---wall%1:06:00:: and fired .
One moment---moment%1:28:00:: there was a man---man%1:18:00:: in the saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: ; the next a headless horror---horror%1:12:00:: on a horse---horse%1:05:00:: that bolted through the redcoat---redcoat%1:18:00:: ranks---rank%1:14:00:: , and during the next second---second%1:28:00:: or two , we all of us fired into the suddenly disorganized column---column%1:14:00:: of soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: .
One moment---moment%1:28:00:: , the road---road%1:06:00:: was filled with disciplined troops---troops%1:14:00:: , marching four---four%1:23:00:: by four---four%1:23:00:: with a purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: as implacable as death---death%1:28:00:: ; the next , a cloud---cloud%1:19:01:: of gun smoke---gun_smoke%1:19:00:: covered a screaming fury---fury%1:26:00:: of sound---sound%1:09:00:: , out of which the redcoat---redcoat%1:18:00:: soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: emerged with their bayonets---bayonet%1:06:00:: and their cursing fury---fury%1:26:00:: .
In the course---course%1:15:00:: of this , they had fired on us ; but I have no memory---memory%1:09:00:: of that .
I had squeezed the trigger---trigger%1:06:00:: of my own gun---gun%1:06:00:: , and to my amazement---amazement%1:12:00:: , it had fired and kicked back into my shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: with the force---force%1:07:00:: of an angry mule---mule%1:05:00:: ; and then I was adding my own voice---voice%1:10:00:: to the crescendo---crescendo%1:07:00:: of sound---sound%1:09:00:: , hurling more vile language---language%1:10:00:: than I ever thought I knew , sobbing and shouting , and aware that if I had passed water before , it was not enough , for my pants were soaking wet .
I would have stood there and died there if left to myself , but Cousin Simmons---person%1:03:00:: grabbed my arm---arm%1:08:00:: in his viselike grip---grip%1:04:00:: and fairly plucked me out of there ; and then I came to some sanity---sanity%1:26:00:: and plunged away with such extraordinary speed---speed%1:07:00:: that I outdistanced Cousin Simmons---person%1:03:00:: by far .
Later we realized that the redcoats---redcoat%1:18:00:: had stopped their charge---charge%1:04:01:: at the wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
Their only hope---hope%1:09:00:: of survival---survival%1:26:00:: was to hold to the road---road%1:06:00:: and keep marching .
We tumbled to a stop---stop%1:11:00:: in Deacon Gordon---person%1:03:00:: 's cow---cow%1:05:01:: hole---hole%1:17:02:: , a low-lying bit---bit%1:17:00:: of pasture---pasture%1:15:00:: with a muddy pool---pool%1:17:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: in its middle---middle%1:15:00:: .
A dozen cows---cow%1:05:01:: mooed sadly and regarded us as if we were insane , as perhaps we were at that moment---moment%1:28:00:: , with the crazy excitement---excitement%1:12:00:: of our first encounter---encounter%1:04:00:: , the yelling---yelling%1:10:00:: and shooting---shooting%1:04:00:: still continuing up at the road---road%1:06:00:: , and the thirst---thirst%1:26:00:: of some of the men---man%1:18:03:: , which was so great that they waded into the muddy water---water%1:27:00:: and scooped up handfuls---handful%1:23:00:: of it .
Isaac Pitt---person%1:03:00:: , one of the men---man%1:18:03:: from Lincoln---location%1:03:00:: , had taken a musket ball---musket_ball%1:06:00:: in his belly---belly%1:08:00:: ; and though he had found the strength---strength%1:07:00:: to run with us , now he collapsed and lay on the ground---ground%1:17:00:: , dying , the Reverend---reverend%1:18:00:: holding his head---head%1:08:00:: and wiping his hot brow---brow%1:08:00:: .
It may appear that we were cruel and callous , but no one had time---time%1:28:05:: to spend sympathizing with poor Isaac---person%1:03:00:: - except the Reverend---person%1:03:00:: .
I know that I myself felt that it was a mortal shame---shame%1:12:00:: for a man---man%1:18:00:: to be torn open by a British musket ball---musket_ball%1:06:00:: , as Isaac---person%1:03:00:: had been , yet I also felt relieved and lucky that it had been him and not myself .
I was drunk with excitement---excitement%1:12:00:: and the smell---smell%1:09:02:: of gunpowder---gunpowder%1:27:00:: that came floating down from the road---road%1:06:00:: , and the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that I was not afraid now , but only waiting to know what to do next .
Meanwhile , I reloaded my gun---gun%1:06:00:: , as the other men---man%1:18:03:: were doing .
We were less than a quarter---quarter%1:23:01:: of a mile---mile%1:23:01:: from the road---road%1:06:00:: , and we could trace its shape---shape%1:07:00:: from the ribbon---ribbon%1:17:00:: of powder---powder%1:27:01:: smoke---smoke%1:19:00:: and dust---dust%1:27:00:: that hung over it .
Wherever you looked , you saw Committeemen---committeeman%1:18:00:: running across the meadows---meadow%1:15:00:: , some away from the road---road%1:06:00:: , some toward it , some parallel to it ; and about a mile---mile%1:23:01:: to the west---west%1:24:00:: a cluster---cluster%1:14:00:: of at least fifty militia---militia%1:14:00:: were making their way in our direction---direction%1:15:00:: .
Cousin Joshua---person%1:03:00:: and some others felt that we should march toward Lexington---location%1:03:00:: and take up new positions---position%1:15:00:: ahead of the slow-moving British---british%1:18:00:: column---column%1:14:00:: , but another group---group%1:03:00:: maintained that we should stick to this spot---spot%1:15:01:: and this section---section%1:06:00:: of road---road%1:06:00:: .
I did n't offer any advice---advice%1:10:00:: , but I certainly did not want to go back to where the officer---officer%1:18:03:: lay with his brains---brain%1:08:00:: dashed out .
Someone said that while we were standing here and arguing about it , the British would be gone ; but Cousin Simmons---person%1:03:00:: said he had watched them marching west early in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: , and moving at a much brisker pace---pace%1:23:01:: it had still taken half---half%1:23:00:: an hour---hour%1:28:00:: for their column---column%1:14:00:: to pass , what with the narrowness---narrowness%1:07:00:: of the road---road%1:06:00:: and their baggage---baggage%1:06:00:: and ammunition---ammunition%1:06:00:: carts---cart%1:06:01:: .
While this was being discussed , we saw the militia---militia%1:14:00:: to the west---west%1:24:00:: of us fanning out and breaking into little clusters---cluster%1:14:00:: of two and three men---man%1:18:00:: as they approached the road---road%1:06:00:: .
It was the opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: of some of us that these must be part---part%1:24:00:: of the Committeemen---committeeman%1:18:00:: who had been in the Battle of the North Bridge , which entitled them to a sort---sort%1:09:00:: of veteran---veteran%1:18:01:: status---status%1:26:00:: , and we felt that if they employed this tactic---tactic%1:09:00:: , it was likely enough the best one .
Mattathias Dover---person%1:03:00:: said :
If we cluster---cluster%1:14:00:: together , the redcoats---redcoat%1:18:00:: can make an advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: out of it , but there 's not a blessed thing---thing%1:09:00:: they can do with two or three of us except chase---chase%1:04:00:: us , and we can outrun them '' .
That settled it , and we broke into parties---party%1:14:02:: of two and three .
Cousin Joshua Dover---person%1:03:00:: decided to remain with the Reverend---person%1:03:00:: and poor Isaac Pitt---person%1:03:00:: until life---life%1:26:00:: passed away - and he was hurt so badly he did not seem for long in this world .
I went off with Cousin Simmons---person%1:03:00:: , who maintained that if he did n't see to me , he did n't know who would .
`` Good heavens , Adam---person%1:03:00:: '' , he said , `` I thought one thing---thing%1:09:00:: you 'd have no trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: learning---learning%1:09:00:: is when to get out of a place---place%1:15:00:: '' .
We ran east for about half---half%1:23:00:: a mile---mile%1:23:01:: before we turned back to the road---road%1:06:00:: , panting from the effort---effort%1:04:00:: and soaked with sweat---sweat%1:08:00:: .
There was a clump---clump%1:14:00:: of trees---tree%1:20:00:: that appeared to provide cover---cover%1:04:00:: right up to the road---road%1:06:00:: , and the shouting---shouting%1:10:01:: and gunfire---gunfire%1:04:00:: never slackened .
Under the trees---tree%1:20:00:: , there was a dead redcoat---redcoat%1:18:00:: , a young boy---boy%1:18:00:: with a pasty white skin---skin%1:08:00:: and a face---face%1:08:00:: full of pimples---pimple%1:26:00:: , who had taken a rifle ball---rifle_ball%1:06:00:: directly between the eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
Three men---man%1:18:00:: were around him .
They had stripped him of his musket---musket%1:06:00:: and equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: , and now they were pulling his boots---boot%1:06:00:: and jacket---jacket%1:06:00:: off .
Cousin Simmons---person%1:03:00:: grabbed one of them by the shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: and flung him away .
`` God's name , what are you to rob the dead---dead%1:14:00:: with the fight---fight%1:04:01:: going on '' !
Cousin Simmons---person%1:03:00:: roared .
They tried to outface him , but Joseph Simmons---person%1:03:00:: was as wide as two average men---man%1:18:00:: , and it would have taken braver men---man%1:18:00:: than these were to outface him .
Pueri Aquam De Silvas Ad Agricolas Portant---person%1:03:00:: , a delightful vignette---vignette%1:10:00:: set in the unforgettable epoch---epoch%1:28:00:: of pre Punic War Rome---rome%1:15:00:: .
Marcellus---person%1:03:00:: , the hero---hero%1:09:00:: , is beset from all sides---side%1:09:00:: by the problems---problem%1:26:00:: of approaching manhood---manhood%1:26:00:: .
The story---story%1:10:03:: opens on the eve---eve%1:28:01:: of his fifty-third birthday---birthday%1:28:00:: , as he prepares for the two weeks---two_weeks%1:28:00:: of festivities---festivity%1:04:00:: that are to follow .
Suddenly , a messenger---messenger%1:18:00:: arrives and , just before collapsing dead at his feet---foot%1:08:01:: , informs him that the Saracens---saracen%1:18:01:: have invaded Silesia---location%1:03:00:: , the home province---province%1:15:00:: of his affianced .
He at once cancels the celebrations---celebration%1:11:00:: and , buckling on his scimitar---scimitar%1:06:00:: , stumbles blindly from the house---house%1:06:00:: , where he is hit and killed by a passing oxcart---oxcart%1:06:00:: .
The Albany Civic Opera---group%1:03:00:: 's presentation---presentation%1:10:00:: of Spumoni---person%1:03:00:: 's immortal Il Sevigli del Spegititgninino , with guest contralto---contralto%1:18:00:: Hattie Sforzt---person%1:03:00:: .
An unusual , if not extraordinary , rendering---rendering%1:10:01:: of the classic myth---myth%1:10:00:: that involves the rescue---rescue%1:04:00:: of Prometheus---prometheus%1:18:00:: from the rock---rock%1:17:01:: by the U.S. Cavalry---group%1:03:00:: was given last week---week%1:28:00:: in the warehouse---warehouse%1:06:00:: of the Albany Leather Conduit Company---group%1:03:00:: amid cheers---cheer%1:10:00:: of `` Hubba hubba '' and `` Yalagaloo pip pip '' !
After a `` busy '' overture---overture%1:10:01:: , the curtain---curtain%1:06:00:: rises on a farm---farm%1:06:00:: scene---scene%1:10:00:: - the Ranavan Valley---location%1:03:00:: in northern Maine---maine%1:15:00:: .
A dead armadillo---armadillo%1:05:00:: , the sole occupant---occupant%1:18:00:: of the stage---stage%1:06:00:: , symbolizes the crisis---crisis%1:26:00:: and destruction---destruction%1:11:00:: of the Old Order .
Old Order , acted and atonally sung by Grunnfeu Arapacis---person%1:03:00:: , the lovely Serbantian import---import%1:18:00:: , then entered and delivered the well-known invocation---invocation%1:10:00:: to the god---god%1:18:01:: Phineoppus---person%1:03:00:: , whereupon the stage---stage%1:06:00:: is quite unexpectedly visited by a company---company%1:14:06:: of wandering Gorshek---location%1:03:00:: priests---priest%1:18:00:: , symbolizing Love---love%1:12:00:: , Lust---lust%1:04:00:: , Prudence---prudence%1:07:00:: and General Motors---group%1:03:00:: , respectively .
According to the myth---myth%1:10:00:: , Old Order then vanishes at stage left---stage_left%1:15:00:: and reappears at extreme stage right---stage_right%1:15:00:: , but director---director%1:18:02:: Shuz---person%1:03:00:: skillfully sidesteps the rather gooshey problem---problem%1:26:00:: of stage effects---stage_effect%1:09:00:: by simply having Miss Arapacis---person%1:03:00:: walk across the stage---stage%1:06:00:: .
The night---night%1:28:00:: we saw it , a rather unpleasant situation---situation%1:26:01:: arose when the soloist---soloist%1:18:00:: refused to approach the armadillo---armadillo%1:05:00:: , complaining - in ad-lib - that `` it smelled '' .
We caught the early train---train%1:06:00:: to New York---new_york%1:15:01:: .
The Dharma Dictionary , a list---list%1:10:00:: of highly unusual terms---term%1:10:00:: used in connection---connection%1:24:00:: with Eurasian proto-senility cults---cult%1:14:00:: .
It 's somewhat off the beaten track , to be sure , but therein lies its variety---variety%1:07:00:: and charm---charm%1:07:00:: .
For example , probably very few people---people%1:14:00:: know that the word---word%1:10:00:: `` visrhanik '' that is bantered about so much today stems from the verb---verb%1:10:01:: `` bouanahsha '' : to salivate .
Likewise , and equally fascinating , is the news---news%1:10:03:: that such unlikely synonyms---synonym%1:10:00:: as `` pratakku '' , `` sweathruna '' , and the tongue-twister---tongue_twister%1:10:00:: `` nnuolapertar-it-vuh-karti-biri-pitknoumen '' all originated in the same village---village%1:14:00:: in Bathar-on-Walli Province---location%1:03:00:: and are all used to express sentiments---sentiment%1:09:00:: concerning British `` imperialism---imperialism%1:10:00:: '' .
The terms---term%1:10:00:: are fairly safe to use on this side---side%1:15:02:: of the ocean---ocean%1:17:00:: , but before you start spouting them to your date---date%1:18:00:: , it might be best to find out if he was a member---member%1:18:00:: of Major Pockmanster---person%1:03:00:: 's Delhi Regiment---group%1:03:00:: , since resentment---resentment%1:12:00:: toward the natives---native%1:18:00:: was reportedly very high in that outfit---outfit%1:14:00:: .
The Breeze And Chancellor Neitzbohr , a movie---movie%1:10:00:: melodrama---melodrama%1:10:00:: that concerns the attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: of a West German politician---politician%1:18:01:: to woo a plaster cast---plaster_cast%1:06:00:: of the Apollo Belvedere---person%1:03:00:: .
As you have doubtless guessed already , the plot---plot%1:10:00:: is plastered with Freudian , Jungian , and Meinckian theory---theory%1:09:01:: .
For example , when the film---film%1:10:01:: is only four minutes---minute%1:28:00:: old , Neitzbohr---person%1:03:00:: refers to a small , Victorian piano stool---piano_stool%1:06:00:: as `` Wilhelmina---person%1:03:00:: '' , and we are thereupon subjected to a flashback---flashback%1:10:00:: that informs us that this very piano stool---piano_stool%1:06:00:: was once used by an epileptic governess---governess%1:18:00:: whose name---name%1:10:00:: , of course , was Doris---person%1:03:00:: ( the English---english%1:10:00:: equivalent---equivalent%1:09:00:: , when passed through middle Gaelic derivations---derivation%1:10:01:: , of Wilhelmina---person%1:03:00:: ) .
For the remainder---remainder%1:24:00:: of the movie---movie%1:10:00:: , Chancellor Neitzbohr---person%1:03:00:: proceeds to lash the piano stool---piano_stool%1:06:00:: with a slat---slat%1:06:00:: from a Venetian blind---venetian_blind%1:06:00:: that used to hang in the pre-war Reichstag---location%1:03:00:: .
In this manner---manner%1:07:02:: , he seeks to expunge from his own soul---soul%1:12:00:: the guilt pangs---guilt_pang%1:12:00:: caused by his personal assaults---assault%1:04:00:: against the English at Dunkirk---location%1:03:00:: .
As we find out at the end---end%1:11:00:: , it is not the stool---stool%1:06:00:: ( symbolizing Doris---person%1:03:00:: , therefore the English ) that he is punishing but the piece---piece%1:06:00:: of Venetian blind---venetian_blind%1:06:00:: .
And , when the slat---slat%1:06:00:: finally shatters , we see him count the fragments---fragment%1:17:01:: , all the while---while%1:28:00:: muttering , `` He loves---love%1:12:00:: me , he loves---love%1:12:00:: me not '' .
After a few tortuous moments---moment%1:28:01:: of wondering who `` he '' is , the camera---movie_camera%1:06:00:: pans across the room---room%1:06:00:: to the plaster---plaster%1:27:01:: statue---statue%1:06:00:: , and we realize that Neitzbohr---person%1:03:00:: is trying to redeem himself in the eyes of a mute piece---piece%1:06:04:: of sculpture---sculpture%1:06:00:: .
The effect---effect%1:09:00:: , needless to say , is almost terrifying , and though at times a bit obscure , the film---film%1:10:01:: is certainly a much needed catharsis---catharsis%1:04:00:: for the `` repressed '' movie-goer---moviegoer%1:18:00:: .
THE MUSIC OF BINI SALFININISTAS , CAPITAL LP 63711 - R , one of the rare recordings---recording%1:06:00:: of this titanic , yet unsung , composer---composer%1:18:00:: .
Those persons---person%1:03:00:: who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance---performance%1:10:00:: of his work---work%1:06:00:: at the Brest-Silevniov Festival in August---august%1:28:00:: , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return---return%1:11:02:: to public notice---notice%1:09:00:: ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach---person%1:03:00:: lay dormant for so many years---year%1:28:01:: , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas---person%1:03:00:: passed through his `` purgatory---purgatory%1:26:00:: '' of neglect---neglect%1:09:00:: .
Those persons who were lucky enough to see and hear the performance of his work at the Brest-Silevniov Festival in August , 1916 , will certainly welcome his return---return%1:04:01:: to public notice ; and it is not unlikely that , even as the great Bach lay dormant for so many years , so has the erudite , ingenious SalFininistas passed through his `` purgatory '' of neglect .
But now , under the guidance---guidance%1:04:01:: of the contemporary composer---composer%1:18:00:: Marc Schlek ,---person%1:03:00:: Jr.---person%1:03:00:: , a major revival---revival%1:04:01:: is under way .
As he leads the Neurenschatz Skolkau Orchestra---group%1:03:00:: , Schlek---person%1:03:00:: gives a tremendously inspired performance---performance%1:10:00:: of both the Baslot---person%1:03:00:: and Rattzhenfuut---person%1:03:00:: concertos---concerto%1:10:00:: , including the controversial Tschilwyk---person%1:03:00:: cadenza---cadenza%1:10:00:: , which was included at the conductor---conductor%1:18:00:: 's insistence---insistence%1:10:00:: .
A major portion---portion%1:24:00:: of the credit---credit%1:10:00:: should also go to flautist---flautist%1:18:00:: Haumd---person%1:03:00:: for his rendering of the almost impossible `` Indianapolis---indianapolis%1:15:00:: '' movement---movement%1:10:00:: in the Baslot---person%1:03:00:: .
Not only was Haumd---person%1:03:00:: 's intonation---intonation%1:10:00:: and phrasing---phrasing%1:04:00:: without flaw---flaw%1:26:00:: , but he seemed to take every tonal eccentricity---eccentricity%1:07:00:: in stride .
For example , to move ( as the score---score%1:10:00:: requires ) from the lowest F major register---register%1:07:00:: up to a barely audible N minor in four seconds---second%1:28:00:: , not skipping , at the same time , even one---one%1:23:00:: of the 407 fingerings---fingering%1:04:02:: , seems a feat---feat%1:04:00:: too absurd to consider , and it is to the flautist---flautist%1:18:00:: 's credit---credit%1:04:01:: that he remained silent throughout the passage---passage%1:10:01:: .
We would have preferred , however , to have had the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the orchestra---orchestra%1:14:00:: refrain from laughing at this and other spots---spot%1:15:01:: on the recording---recording%1:06:00:: , since it mars an otherwise sober , if not lofty , performance---performance%1:10:00:: .
As Broadway---broadway%1:15:00:: itself becomes increasingly weighted down by trite , heavy-handed , commercially successful musicals---musical%1:10:00:: and inspirational problem---problem%1:26:00:: dramas---drama%1:10:01:: , the American theatre---theatre%1:10:00:: is going through an inexorable renaissance---renaissance%1:04:00:: in that nebulous area---area%1:15:01:: known as `` off-Broadway---off-broadway%1:15:00:: '' .
For the last two years---year%1:28:01:: , this frontier---frontier%1:15:00:: of the arts---arts%1:09:00:: has produced a number---number%1:07:00:: of so-called `` non dramas---drama%1:10:01:: '' which have left indelible , bittersweet impressions---impression%1:09:00:: on the psyche---psyche%1:09:00:: of this veteran theatregoer---theatregoer%1:18:00:: .
The latest and , significantly , greatest fruit---fruit%1:11:00:: of this theatrical vine---vine%1:20:00:: is The , an adaptation---adaptation%1:10:00:: of Basho---person%1:03:00:: 's classic frog---frog%1:05:00:: haiku---haiku%1:10:00:: by Roger Entwhistle---person%1:03:00:: , a former University of Maryland---group%1:03:00:: chemistry---chemistry%1:09:00:: instructor---instructor%1:18:00:: .
Although the play---play%1:10:01:: does show a certain structural amateurishness---amateurishness%1:09:00:: ( there are eleven acts---act%1:10:00:: varying in length---length%1:07:01:: from twenty-five seconds---second%1:28:00:: to an hour---hour%1:28:00:: and a half---half%1:23:00:: ) , the statement---statement%1:10:00:: it makes concerning the ceaseless yearning---yearning%1:12:00:: and searching of youth---youth%1:28:00:: is profound and worthy of our attention---attention%1:09:00:: .
The action---action%1:10:00:: centers about a group---group%1:03:00:: of outspoken and offbeat students---student%1:18:00:: sitting around a table---table%1:06:01:: in a cafeteria---cafeteria%1:06:00:: and their collective and ultimately fruitless search---search%1:04:00:: for a cup---cup%1:23:01:: of hot coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: .
They are relentlessly rebuffed on all sides---side%1:09:00:: by a waitress---waitress%1:18:00:: , the police---police%1:14:00:: , and an intruding government---government%1:14:00:: tutor---tutor%1:18:00:: .
The innocence---innocence%1:07:01:: that they tried to conceal at the beginning---beginning%1:09:00:: is clearly destroyed forever when one of them , asking for a piece---piece%1:06:00:: of lemon-meringue pie---lemon_meringue_pie%1:13:00:: , gets a plate---plate%1:23:00:: of English muffins---english_muffin%1:13:00:: instead .
Leaving the theatre---theatre%1:06:00:: after the performance---performance%1:10:00:: , I had a flash---flash%1:09:00:: of intuition---intuition%1:09:00:: that life---life%1:09:00:: , after all ( as Rilke---person%1:03:00:: said ) , is just a search---search%1:04:00:: for the nonexistent cup---cup%1:23:01:: of hot coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: , and that this unpretentious , moving , clever , bitter slice---slice%1:21:00:: of life---life%1:09:00:: was the greatest thing---thing%1:11:00:: to happen to the American theatre---theatre%1:10:00:: since Brooks Atkinson---person%1:03:00:: retired .
Aging but still precocious , French feline enfant terrible---enfant_terrible%1:18:00:: Francoisette Lagoon---person%1:03:00:: has succeeded in shocking jaded old Paris---paris%1:15:00:: again , this time---time%1:11:00:: with a sexy ballet---ballet%1:04:00:: scenario---scenario%1:10:00:: called The Lascivious Interlude , the story---story%1:10:03:: of a nymphomaniac---nymphomaniac%1:18:00:: trip-hammer---triphammer%1:06:00:: operator---operator%1:18:00:: who falls hopelessly in love with a middle-aged steam shovel---steam_shovel%1:06:00:: .
A biting , pithy parable---parable%1:10:00:: of the all pervading hollowness---hollowness%1:26:00:: of modern life---life%1:26:01:: , the piece---piece%1:10:01:: has been set by Mlle Lagoon---person%1:03:00:: to a sumptuous score---score%1:10:00:: ( a single motif---motif%1:10:00:: played over and over by four thousand French horns---french_horn%1:06:00:: ) by existentialist---existentialist%1:18:00:: hot-shot---hotshot%1:18:00:: Jean-Paul Sartre---person%1:03:00:: .
Petite , lovely Yvette Chadroe---person%1:03:00:: plays the nymphomaniac---nymphomaniac%1:18:00:: engagingly .
Ever since Bambi , and , more recently , Born Free , there have been a lot of books---book%1:10:00:: about animals---animal%1:03:00:: , but few compare with Max Fink---person%1:03:00:: 's wry , understated , charming , and immensely readable My Friend , the Quizzical Salamander .
Done in the modern style---style%1:07:00:: of a `` confession---confession%1:10:00:: '' , Fink---person%1:03:00:: tells in exquisite detail---detail%1:10:00:: how he came to know , and , more important , love his mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's pet---pet%1:05:00:: salamander---salamander%1:05:00:: , Alicia---person%1:03:00:: .
It is not an entirely happy book---book%1:10:00:: , as Mrs. Fink---person%1:03:00:: soon becomes jealous of Alicia---person%1:03:00:: and , in retaliation---retaliation%1:04:00:: , refuses to continue to scrape the algae---algae%1:05:00:: off her glass---glass%1:27:00:: .
Max---person%1:03:00:: , in a fit---fit%1:26:01:: of despair---despair%1:26:00:: , takes Alicia---person%1:03:00:: and runs off for two marvelous weeks---week%1:28:00:: in Burbank---location%1:03:00:: ( Fink---person%1:03:00:: calls it `` the most wonderful and lovely fourteen days---day%1:28:00:: in my whole life---life%1:28:01:: '' ) , at the end---end%1:28:00:: of which Alicia---person%1:03:00:: tragically contracts Parkinson's disease---parkinson's_disease%1:26:00:: and dies .
This brief resume---resume%1:10:00:: hardly does the book---book%1:10:00:: justice , but I heartily recommend it to all those who are engages with the major problems---problem%1:26:00:: of our time---time%1:28:00:: .
Opera---opera%1:10:00:: in the Grand Tradition , along with mah-jongg---mah-jongg%1:04:00:: , seems to be staging a well deserved comeback---comeback%1:10:00:: .
In this country---country%1:15:00:: , the two guiding lights---guiding_light%1:18:00:: are , without doubt , Felix Fing---person%1:03:00:: and Anna Pulova---person%1:03:00:: .
Fing---person%1:03:00:: , a lean , chiseled , impeccable gentleman---gentleman%1:18:00:: of the old school---old_school%1:14:00:: who was once mistaken on the street---street%1:06:00:: for Sir Cedric Hardwicke---person%1:03:00:: , is responsible for the rediscovery---rediscovery%1:04:00:: of Verdi---person%1:03:00:: 's earliest , most raucous opera---opera%1:10:00:: , Nabisco , a sumptuous bout-de-souffle with a haunting leitmotiv---leitmotiv%1:10:00:: that struck me as being highly reminiscent of the Mudugno---person%1:03:00:: version---version%1:10:02:: of `` Volare '' .
Miss Pulova---person%1:03:00:: has a voice---voice%1:07:00:: that Maria Callas---person%1:03:00:: once described as `` like chipping teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: with a screw driver---screwdriver%1:06:00:: '' , and her round , opalescent face---face%1:08:00:: becomes fascinatingly reflective of the emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: demanded by the role---role%1:09:00:: of Rosalie---person%1:03:00:: .
The Champs Elysees---location%1:03:00:: is literally littered this summer---summer%1:28:00:: with the prostrate bodies---body%1:08:00:: of France---france%1:15:00:: 's beat-up beatnik---beatnik%1:18:00:: jeunes filles .
Cause---cause%1:03:00:: of all this commotion---commotion%1:26:00:: : squat , pug-nosed , balding , hopelessly ugly Jean-Pierre Bravado---person%1:03:00:: , a Bogartian figure---figure%1:18:00:: , who plays a sadistic , amoral , philosophic Tasti-Freeze---group%1:03:00:: salesman---salesman%1:18:00:: in old New-Waver---new_waver%1:18:00:: Fredrico de Mille Rossilini---person%1:03:00:: 's endlessly provocative film---film%1:10:01:: , A Sour Sponge .
Bravado---person%1:03:00:: has been alternately described as `` a symbol---symbol%1:10:00:: of the new grandeur---grandeur%1:07:01:: of France---france%1:15:00:: and myself '' ( De Gaulle---person%1:03:00:: ) and `` a decadent , disgusting slob---slob%1:18:00:: '' !
( Norman Mailer---person%1:03:00:: ) , but no one can deny that the screen---screen%1:06:06:: crackles with electricity---electricity%1:12:00:: whenever he is on it .
Soaring to stardom---stardom%1:26:00:: along with him , Margo Felicity Brighetti---person%1:03:00:: , a luscious and curvaceously beguiling Italian starlet---starlet%1:18:00:: , turns in a creditable performance---performance%1:10:00:: as an airplane---airplane%1:06:00:: mechanic---mechanic%1:18:01:: .
The battle---battle%1:04:01:: of the drib-drool continues , but most of New York---new_york%1:15:01:: 's knowing sophisticates---sophisticate%1:18:00:: of Abstract Expressionism---abstract_expressionism%1:06:00:: are stamping their feet---foot%1:08:01:: impatiently in expectation---expectation%1:26:00:: of V ( for Vindication---vindication%1:04:01:: ) Day---day%1:28:01:: , September---september%1:28:00:: first---first%1:23:00:: , when Augustus Quasimodo---person%1:03:00:: 's first one-man show---show%1:04:00:: opens at the Guggenheim---location%1:03:00:: .
We have heard that after seeing Mr. Quasimodo---person%1:03:00:: 's work---work%1:06:00:: it will be virtually impossible to deny the artistic validity---validity%1:07:01:: and importance---importance%1:07:00:: of the whole abstract movement---movement%1:14:00:: .
And it is thought by many who think about such things---thing%1:09:02:: that Quasimodo---person%1:03:00:: is the logical culmination---culmination%1:28:00:: of a school---school%1:14:02:: that started with Monet---person%1:03:00:: , progressed through Kandinsky---person%1:03:00:: and the cubist Picasso---picasso%1:18:00:: , and blossomed just recently in Pollock---person%1:03:00:: and De Kooning---person%1:03:00:: .
Quasimodo---person%1:03:00:: defines his own art---art%1:10:00:: as `` the search---search%1:04:00:: for what is not there '' .
`` I paint the nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: '' , he said once to Franz Kline---person%1:03:00:: and myself , `` the nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: that is behind the something , the inexpressible , unpaintable ' tick---tick%1:11:00:: ' in the unconscious , the ' spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: ' of the moment---moment%1:28:00:: resting forever , suspended like a huge balloon---balloon%1:06:00:: , in non time---time%1:03:00:: '' .
It is his relentlessness---relentlessness%1:07:00:: and unwavering adherence---adherence%1:04:00:: to this revolutionary artistic philosophy---philosophy%1:09:00:: that has enabled him to paint such pictures---picture%1:06:01:: as `` The Invasion of Cuba '' .
In this work---work%1:06:00:: , his use of non color---color%1:07:00:: is startling and skillful .
The sweep---sweep%1:07:00:: of space---space%1:25:00:: , the delicate counterbalance---counterbalance%1:06:00:: of the white masses---mass%1:23:00:: , the over-all completeness---completeness%1:26:00:: and unity---unity%1:26:00:: , the originality---originality%1:09:00:: and imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: , all entitle it to be called an authentic masterpiece---masterpiece%1:06:00:: .
I asked Quasimodo---person%1:03:00:: recently how he accomplished this , and he replied that he had painted his model---model%1:18:00:: `` a beautiful shade---shade%1:07:00:: of red and then had her breathe on the canvas---canvas%1:06:04:: '' , which was his typical tongue-in-cheek way---way%1:07:01:: of chiding me for my lack---lack%1:26:00:: of sensitivity---sensitivity%1:12:00:: .
It has recently become practical to use the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: and planets---planet%1:17:00:: as a new source---source%1:10:00:: of information---information%1:09:00:: about these bodies---heavenly_body%1:17:00:: and their atmospheres---atmosphere%1:17:00:: .
The results---result%1:19:00:: of present observations---observation%1:04:01:: of the thermal radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: are consistent with the very low thermal conductivity---conductivity%1:19:00:: of the surface---surface%1:06:00:: layer---layer%1:15:00:: which was derived from the variation---variation%1:11:01:: in the infrared emission---infrared_emission%1:19:00:: during eclipses---eclipse%1:11:00:: ( e.g. , Garstung---person%1:03:00:: , 1958 ) .
When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements are available , it will be possible to set limits---limit%1:07:00:: on the thermal and electrical characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: of the surface---surface%1:06:00:: and subsurface materials---material%1:27:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: .
Observations---observation%1:04:01:: of the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of a planet---planet%1:17:00:: which has an extensive atmosphere---atmosphere%1:17:00:: will probe the atmosphere---atmosphere%1:17:00:: to a greater extent than those using shorter wave lengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: and should in some cases---case%1:11:00:: give otherwise unobtainable information---information%1:09:00:: about the characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: of the solid surface---surface%1:06:00:: .
Radio observations---radio_observation%1:04:00:: of Venus---venus%1:17:00:: and Jupiter---jupiter%1:17:00:: have already supplied unexpected experimental data---data%1:14:00:: on the physical conditions---condition%1:26:00:: of these planets---planet%1:17:00:: .
The observed intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: of the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of Venus---venus%1:17:00:: is much higher than the expected thermal intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: , although the spectrum---spectrum%1:19:00:: indicated by measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: at wave lengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: near 3 cm---cm%1:23:00:: and 10 cm---cm%1:23:00:: is like that of a black body---blackbody%1:17:00:: at about 600 ` K---k%1:23:05:: .
This result---result%1:19:00:: suggests a very high temperature---high_temperature%1:07:00:: at the solid surface---surface%1:06:00:: of the planet---planet%1:17:00:: , although there is the possibility---possibility%1:09:01:: that the observed radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: may be a combination---combination%1:14:00:: of both thermal and non thermal components---component%1:09:00:: and that the observed spectrum---spectrum%1:19:00:: is that of a black body---blackbody%1:17:00:: merely by coincidence---coincidence%1:11:00:: .
For the case---case%1:09:00:: of Jupiter---jupiter%1:17:00:: , the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: spectrum---spectrum%1:19:00:: is definitely not like the spectrum---spectrum%1:19:00:: of a black-body---blackbody%1:17:00:: radiator---radiator%1:17:00:: , and it seems very likely that the radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: reaching the earth---earth%1:17:00:: is a combination---combination%1:14:00:: of thermal radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: from the atmosphere---atmosphere%1:17:00:: and non thermal components---component%1:09:00:: .
Of the remaining planets---planet%1:17:00:: , only Mars---mars%1:17:00:: and Saturn---saturn%1:17:00:: have been observed as radio sources---radio_source%1:17:00:: , and not very much information---information%1:09:00:: is available .
Mars---mars%1:17:00:: has been observed twice at about 3 - cm---cm%1:23:00:: wave length---wavelength%1:07:00:: , and the intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: of the observed radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: is in reasonable agreement---agreement%1:07:00:: with the thermal radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: which might be predicted on the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of the known temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of Mars---mars%1:17:00:: .
The low intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: of the radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: from Saturn---saturn%1:17:00:: has limited observations---observation%1:04:01:: , but again the measured radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: seems to be consistent with a thermal origin---origin%1:15:00:: .
No attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: to measure the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of the remaining planets---planet%1:17:00:: have been reported , and , because of their distances---distance%1:07:00:: , small diameters---diameter%1:07:00:: , or low temperatures---low_temperature%1:07:00:: , the thermal radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: at radio wave lengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: reaching the earth---earth%1:17:00:: from these sources---source%1:15:00:: is expected to be of very low intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: .
In spite of this , the very large radio reflectors---radio_reflector%1:06:00:: and improved amplifying techniques---technique%1:09:00:: which are now becoming available should make it possible to observe the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of most of the planets---planet%1:17:00:: in a few years---year%1:28:01:: .
The study---study%1:04:00:: of the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: and planets---planet%1:17:00:: began with the detection---detection%1:04:00:: of the thermal radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: at 1.25 - cm---cm%1:23:00:: wave length---wavelength%1:07:00:: by Dicke---person%1:03:00:: and Beringer---person%1:03:00:: ( 1946 ) .
This was followed by a comprehensive series---series%1:14:00:: of observations---observation%1:04:01:: of the 1.25 - cm---cm%1:23:00:: emission---emission%1:04:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: over three lunar cycles---cycle%1:28:00:: by Piddington---person%1:03:00:: and Minnett---person%1:03:00:: ( 1949 ) .
They deduced from their measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: that the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: from the whole disk---disk%1:25:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: varied during a lunation---lunation%1:28:00:: in a roughly sinusoidal fashion---fashion%1:04:00:: ; that the amplitude---amplitude%1:11:00:: of the variation---variation%1:11:01:: was considerably less than the amplitude---amplitude%1:11:00:: of the variation---variation%1:11:01:: in the infrared emission---infrared_emission%1:19:00:: as measured by Pettit---person%1:03:00:: and Nicholson---person%1:03:00:: ( 1930 ) and Pettit---person%1:03:00:: ( 1935 ) ; and that the maximum---maximum%1:23:00:: of the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: came about 3 - 1 2 days---day%1:28:00:: after Full Moon---full_moon%1:28:00:: , which is again in contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: to the infrared emission---infrared_emission%1:19:00:: , which reaches its maximum---maximum%1:23:00:: at Full Moon---full_moon%1:28:00:: .
Piddington---person%1:03:00:: and Minnett---person%1:03:00:: explained their observations---observation%1:04:01:: by pointing out---pointing_out%1:10:00:: that rocklike materials---material%1:27:00:: which are likely to make up the surface---surface%1:06:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: would be partially transparent to radio waves---radio_wave%1:19:00:: , although opaque to infrared radiation---infrared_radiation%1:19:00:: .
The infrared emission---infrared_emission%1:19:00:: could then be assumed to originate at the surface---surface%1:06:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: , while the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: originates at some depth---depth%1:07:00:: beneath the surface---surface%1:06:00:: , where the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: variation---variation%1:11:01:: due to solar radiation---solar_radiation%1:19:00:: is reduced in amplitude---amplitude%1:11:00:: and shifted in phase---phase%1:28:01:: .
Since the absorption---absorption%1:22:02:: of radio waves---radio_wave%1:19:00:: in rocklike material---material%1:27:00:: varies with wave length---wavelength%1:07:00:: , it should be possible to sample the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: variation---variation%1:11:01:: at different depths---depth%1:07:00:: beneath the surface---surface%1:06:00:: and possibly detect changes---change%1:24:00:: in the structure---structure%1:06:00:: or composition---composition%1:07:01:: of the lunar surface---surface%1:06:00:: material---material%1:27:00:: .
The radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of a planet---planet%1:17:00:: was first detected in 1955 , when Burke---person%1:03:00:: and Franklin---person%1:03:00:: ( 1955 ) identified the origin---origin%1:15:00:: of interference---interference%1:11:00:: like radio noise---radio_noise%1:11:00:: on their records---record%1:10:03:: at about 15 meters---meter%1:23:00:: wave length---wavelength%1:07:00:: as emission---emission%1:04:00:: from Jupiter---jupiter%1:17:00:: .
This sporadic type---type%1:09:00:: of planetary radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: is discussed by Burke---person%1:03:00:: ( chap. 13 ) and Gallet---person%1:03:00:: ( chap. 14 ) .
Steady radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: which was presumably of thermal origin---origin%1:15:00:: was observed from Venus---venus%1:17:00:: at 3.15 and 9.4 cm---cm%1:23:00:: , and from Mars---mars%1:17:00:: and Jupiter---jupiter%1:17:00:: at 3.15 cm---cm%1:23:00:: in 1956 ( Mayer---person%1:03:00:: , McCullough---person%1:03:00:: , and Sloanaker---person%1:03:00:: , 1958 a , b , c ) , and from Saturn---saturn%1:17:00:: at 3.75 cm---cm%1:23:00:: in 1957 ( Drake---person%1:03:00:: and Ewen---person%1:03:00:: , 1958 ) .
In the relatively short time---time%1:28:05:: since these early observations---observation%1:04:01:: , Venus---venus%1:17:00:: has been observed at additional wave lengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: in the range---range%1:07:00:: from 0.8 to 10.2 cm---cm%1:23:00:: , and Jupiter---jupiter%1:17:00:: has been observed over the wave-length---wavelength%1:07:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: from 3.03 to 68 cm---cm%1:23:00:: .
The observable characteristics---characteristic%1:09:00:: of planetary radio radiation---radio_radiation%1:19:00:: are the intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: , the polarization---polarization%1:19:00:: , and the direction---direction%1:15:00:: of arrival---arrival%1:04:00:: of the waves---wave%1:11:00:: .
The maximum angular diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: of any planetary disk---disk%1:25:00:: as observed from the earth---earth%1:17:00:: is about 1 minute of arc---minute_of_arc%1:23:00:: .
This is much smaller than the highest resolution---resolution%1:19:00:: of even the very large reflectors---reflector%1:06:00:: now under construction---construction%1:04:00:: , and consequently the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of different regions---region%1:15:00:: of the disk---disk%1:25:00:: cannot be resolved .
It should be possible , however , to put useful limits---limit%1:07:00:: on the diameters---diameter%1:07:00:: of the radio sources---radio_source%1:17:00:: by observing with large reflectors---reflector%1:06:00:: or with interferometers---interferometer%1:06:00:: .
Measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: of polarization---polarization%1:19:00:: are presently limited by apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: sensitivity---sensitivity%1:07:00:: and will remain difficult because of the low intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: of the planetary radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: at the earth---earth%1:17:00:: .
There have been few measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: specifically for the determination---determination%1:04:00:: of the polarization---polarization%1:19:00:: of planetary radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: .
The measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: made with the NRL 50 - foot---foot%1:23:00:: reflector---reflector%1:06:00:: , which is altitude---altitude%1:07:00:: azimuth---azimuth%1:25:00:: mounted , would have shown a systematic change---change%1:24:00:: with local hour angle---hour_angle%1:15:00:: in the measured intensities---intensity%1:07:03:: of Venus---venus%1:17:00:: and Jupiter---jupiter%1:17:00:: if a substantial part---part%1:17:00:: of the radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: had been linearly polarized .
Recent interferometer---interferometer%1:06:00:: measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: ( Radhakrishnan---person%1:03:00:: and Roberts---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ) have shown the 960 - Mc---mc%1:28:00:: emission---emission%1:04:00:: of Jupiter---jupiter%1:17:00:: to be partially polarized and to originate in a region---region%1:15:00:: of larger diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: than the visible disk---disk%1:25:00:: .
Other than this very significant result---result%1:19:00:: , most of the information---information%1:09:00:: now available about the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of the planets---planet%1:17:00:: is restricted to the intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: of the radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: .
The concept---concept%1:09:00:: of apparent black-body---blackbody%1:17:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: is used to describe the radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: received from the moon---moon%1:17:01:: and the planets---planet%1:17:00:: .
The received radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: is compared with the radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: from a hypothetical black-body---blackbody%1:17:00:: which subtends the same solid angle---solid_angle%1:25:00:: as the visible disk---disk%1:25:00:: of the planet---planet%1:17:00:: .
The apparent black-body---blackbody%1:17:00:: disk---disk%1:25:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: is the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: which must be assumed for the black body---blackbody%1:17:00:: in order that the intensity---intensity%1:07:03:: of its radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: should equal that of the observed radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: .
The use---use%1:04:00:: of this concept---concept%1:09:00:: does not specify the origin---origin%1:15:00:: of the radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: , and only if the planet---planet%1:17:00:: really radiates as a black body---blackbody%1:17:00:: , will the apparent black-body---blackbody%1:17:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: correspond to the physical temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of the emitting material---material%1:27:00:: .
The radio radiation---radio_radiation%1:19:00:: of the sun---sun%1:17:00:: which is reflected from the moon---moon%1:17:01:: and planets---planet%1:17:00:: should be negligible compared with their thermal emission---thermal_emission%1:22:00:: at centimeter---centimeter%1:23:00:: wave lengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: , except possibly at times---time%1:11:00:: of exceptional outbursts---outburst%1:11:00:: of solar radio noise---radio_noise%1:11:00:: .
The quiescent level---level%1:26:01:: of centimeter---centimeter%1:23:00:: wave-length---wavelength%1:07:00:: solar radiation---solar_radiation%1:19:00:: would increase the average disk---disk%1:25:00:: brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: by less than 1 ` K---k%1:23:05:: .
At meter---meter%1:23:00:: wave lengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: and increase---increase%1:04:00:: of the order---order%1:07:01:: of 10 ` K---k%1:23:05:: in the average disk---disk%1:25:00:: temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: of the nearer planets---planet%1:17:00:: would be expected .
Therefore , neglecting the extreme outbursts---outburst%1:11:00:: , reflected solar radiation---solar_radiation%1:19:00:: is not expected to cause sizable errors---error%1:07:00:: in the measurements of planetary radiation---radiation%1:04:00:: in the centimeter---centimeter%1:23:00:: - and decimeter---decimeter%1:23:00:: wave-length---wavelength%1:07:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: .
Radio observations---radio_observation%1:04:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: have been made over the range---range%1:07:00:: of wave lengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: from 4.3 mm---mm%1:23:00:: to 75 cm---cm%1:23:00:: , and the results---result%1:19:00:: are summarized in Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 .
Observations---observation%1:04:01:: have also been made at 1.5 mm---mm%1:23:00:: using optical techniques---technique%1:09:00:: ( Sinton---person%1:03:00:: , 1955 , 1956 , ; see also chap. 11 ) .
Not all the observers---observer%1:18:01:: have used the same procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: or made the same assumptions---assumption%1:09:00:: about the lunar brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: when reducing the data---data%1:14:00:: , and this , together with differences---difference%1:07:00:: in the methods---method%1:09:00:: of calibrating the antennae---antenna%1:06:00:: and receivers---receiver%1:06:00:: , must account for much of the disagreement---disagreement%1:07:00:: in the measured radio brightness---radio_brightness%1:07:00:: temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: .
In the observations---observation%1:04:01:: at 4.3 mm---mm%1:23:00:: ( Coates---person%1:03:00:: , 1959 a ) , the diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: of the antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: beam---beam%1:10:00:: , 6 ' .7 , was small enough to allow resolution---resolution%1:19:00:: of some of the larger features---feature%1:09:00:: of the lunar surface---surface%1:06:00:: , and contour---contour%1:10:00:: diagrams---diagram%1:06:00:: have been made of the lunar brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: at three lunar phases---phase%1:28:00:: .
These observations---observation%1:04:01:: indicate that the lunar maria---maria%1:17:00:: heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous regions---region%1:15:00:: .
Mare Imbrium---location%1:03:00:: seems to be an exception---exception%1:09:00:: and remains cooler than the regions---region%1:15:00:: which surround it .
These contour---contour%1:10:00:: diagrams---diagram%1:06:00:: also suggest a rather rapid falloff---falloff%1:22:00:: in the radio brightness---radio_brightness%1:07:00:: with latitude---latitude%1:15:00:: .
Very recently , observations---observation%1:04:01:: have been made at 8 - mm---mm%1:23:00:: wave length---wavelength%1:07:00:: with a reflector---reflector%1:06:00:: 22 meters---meter%1:23:00:: in diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: with a resultant beam---beam%1:10:00:: width---width%1:07:00:: of only about 2 ' ( Amenitskii---person%1:03:00:: , Noskova---person%1:03:00:: , and Salomonovich---person%1:03:00:: , 1960 ) .
The constant temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: contours---contour%1:10:00:: are much smoother than those observed at 4.3 mm---mm%1:23:00:: by Coates---person%1:03:00:: ( 1959 a ) , and apparently the emission---emission%1:04:00:: at 8 mm---mm%1:23:00:: is not nearly so sensitive to differences---difference%1:07:00:: in surface---surface%1:06:00:: features---feature%1:09:00:: .
Such high-resolution observations---observation%1:04:01:: as these are needed at several wave lengths---wavelength%1:07:00:: in order that the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: can be properly interpreted .
The observations---observation%1:04:01:: of Mayer---person%1:03:00:: , McCullough---person%1:03:00:: , and Sloanaker---person%1:03:00:: at 3.15 cm---cm%1:23:00:: and of Sloanaker---person%1:03:00:: at 10.3 cm---cm%1:23:00:: have not previously been published and will be briefly described .
Measurements at 3.15 cm---cm%1:23:00:: were obtained on 11 days---day%1:28:01:: spread over the interval---interval%1:28:00:: May---may%1:28:00:: 3 to June---june%1:28:00:: 19 , 1956 , using the 50 - foot---foot%1:23:00:: reflector---reflector%1:06:00:: at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory---group%1:03:00:: in Washington---location%1:03:00:: .
The half-intensity---half-intensity%1:07:00:: diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: of the antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: beam---beam%1:10:00:: was about 9 ' , and the angle---angle%1:25:00:: subtended by the moon---moon%1:17:01:: included the entire main beam---beam%1:10:00:: and part---part%1:06:00:: of the first side---side%1:15:02:: lobes---lobe%1:08:00:: .
The antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: and the power---power%1:19:00:: gain---gain%1:07:01:: at the peak of the beam---beam%1:10:00:: were both measured ( Mayer---person%1:03:00:: , McCullough---person%1:03:00:: , and Sloanaker---person%1:03:00:: , 1958 b ) , so that the absolute power---power%1:19:00:: sensitivity---sensitivity%1:07:00:: of the antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: beam---beam%1:10:00:: over the solid angle---solid_angle%1:25:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: was known .
The ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: of the measured antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: temperature change---temperature_change%1:22:00:: during a drift---drift%1:19:00:: scan---scan%1:04:00:: across the moon---moon%1:17:01:: to the average brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: over the antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: beam---beam%1:10:00:: ( assuming that the brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of the sky---sky%1:17:00:: is negligible ) was found , by graphical integration---integration%1:04:03:: of the antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: directivity---directivity%1:07:00:: diagram---diagram%1:06:00:: , to be 0.85 .
The measured brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: is a good approximation---approximation%1:09:00:: to the brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: at the center---center%1:15:00:: of the lunar disk---disk%1:25:00:: because of the narrow antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: beam---beam%1:10:00:: and because the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: over the central portion---portion%1:06:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: 's disk---disk%1:25:00:: is nearly uniform .
The result---result%1:19:00:: of the observations---observation%1:04:01:: is ( in ` K---k%1:23:05:: ) **f where the phase---phase%1:28:00:: angle---angle%1:25:00:: , |qt , is measured in degrees---degree%1:23:00:: from new moon---new_moon%1:28:00:: and the probable errors---error%1:07:00:: include absolute as well as relative errors---error%1:07:00:: .
This result---result%1:19:00:: is plotted along with the 8.6 - mm---mm%1:23:00:: observations---observation%1:04:01:: of Gibson---person%1:03:00:: ( 1958 ) in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 1 , a .
The variation---variation%1:11:01:: in the 3 - cm---cm%1:23:00:: emission---emission%1:04:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: during a lunation---lunation%1:28:00:: is very much less than the variation---variation%1:11:01:: in the 8.6 - mm---mm%1:23:00:: emission---emission%1:04:00:: , as would be expected from the explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: of Piddington---person%1:03:00:: and Minnett---person%1:03:00:: ( 1949 ) .
In the discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: which follows , the time---time%1:28:05:: average---average%1:09:00:: of the radio emission---radio_emission%1:19:00:: will be referred to as the constant component---component%1:09:00:: , and the superimposed periodic variation---variation%1:11:01:: will be called the variable component---component%1:09:00:: .
The 10.3 - cm---cm%1:23:00:: observation---observation%1:04:00:: of Sloanaker---person%1:03:00:: was made on May---may%1:28:00:: 20 , 1958 , using the 84 - foot---foot%1:23:00:: reflector---reflector%1:06:00:: at the Maryland Point Observatory---group%1:03:00:: of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory---group%1:03:00:: .
The age---age%1:07:00:: of the moon---moon%1:17:01:: was about 2 days---day%1:28:00:: .
The half-intensity---half-intensity%1:07:00:: diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: of the main lobe---lobe%1:08:00:: of the antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: was about 18 ' .5 , and the brightness---brightness%1:07:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: was reduced by assuming a Gaussian shape---gaussian_shape%1:09:00:: for the antenna---antenna%1:06:00:: beam---beam%1:10:00:: and a uniformly bright disk---disk%1:25:00:: for the moon---moon%1:17:01:: .
Committee---committee%1:14:00:: approval---approval%1:04:02:: of Gov. Price Daniel---person%1:03:00:: 's `` abandoned property---property%1:21:00:: '' act---act%1:10:01:: seemed certain Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: despite the adamant protests---protest%1:10:00:: of Texas---texas%1:15:00:: bankers---banker%1:18:00:: .
Daniel---person%1:03:00:: personally led the fight---fight%1:04:02:: for the measure---measure%1:10:02:: , which he had watered down considerably since its rejection---rejection%1:04:00:: by two previous Legislatures---legislature%1:14:00:: , in a public hearing---hearing%1:04:01:: before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation---group%1:03:00:: .
Under committee---committee%1:14:00:: rules---rule%1:10:00:: , it went automatically to a subcommittee---subcommittee%1:14:00:: for one week---week%1:28:00:: .
But questions---question%1:10:00:: with which committee members---committee_member%1:18:00:: taunted bankers---banker%1:18:00:: appearing as witnesses---witness%1:18:00:: left little doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: that they will recommend passage---passage%1:04:01:: of it .
Daniel---person%1:03:00:: termed `` extremely conservative '' his estimate---estimate%1:09:00:: that it would produce 17 million---million%1:23:00:: dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: to help erase an anticipated deficit---deficit%1:07:00:: of 63 million---million%1:23:00:: dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: at the end---end%1:28:00:: of the current fiscal year---fiscal_year%1:28:00:: next Aug.---aug%1:28:00:: 31 .
He told the committee---committee%1:14:00:: the measure---measure%1:10:02:: would merely provide means---means%1:04:00:: of enforcing the escheat---escheat%1:21:00:: law---law%1:10:00:: which has been on the books `` since Texas---texas%1:15:00:: was a republic---republic%1:14:00:: '' .
It permits the state---state%1:14:01:: to take over bank accounts---bank_account%1:21:00:: , stocks---stock%1:21:00:: and other personal property---personal_property%1:21:00:: of persons---person%1:03:00:: missing for seven years---year%1:28:01:: or more .
The bill---bill%1:10:04:: , which Daniel---person%1:03:00:: said he drafted personally , would force banks---bank%1:14:00:: , insurance firms---insurance_firm%1:14:00:: , pipeline companies---pipeline_company%1:14:00:: and other corporations---corporation%1:14:00:: to report such property---property%1:21:00:: to the state treasurer---state_treasurer%1:18:00:: .
The escheat---escheat%1:21:00:: law---law%1:10:00:: cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property---property%1:21:00:: , Daniel---person%1:03:00:: declared .
Dewey Lawrence---person%1:03:00:: , a Tyler---location%1:03:00:: lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: representing the Texas Bankers Association---group%1:03:00:: , sounded the opposition---opposition%1:18:01:: keynote---keynote%1:10:01:: when he said it would force banks---bank%1:14:00:: to violate their contractual obligations---obligation%1:04:00:: with depositors---depositor%1:18:00:: and undermine the confidence---confidence%1:12:00:: of bank---bank%1:14:00:: customers---customer%1:18:00:: .
`` If you destroy confidence---confidence%1:12:00:: in banks---bank%1:14:00:: , you do something to the economy---economy%1:14:00:: '' , he said .
`` You take out of circulation---circulation%1:10:00:: many millions---million%1:23:00:: of dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: '' .
Rep. Charles E. Hughes---person%1:03:00:: of Sherman---location%1:03:00:: , sponsor---sponsor%1:18:00:: of the bill---bill%1:10:04:: , said a failure---failure%1:04:00:: to enact it would `` amount to making a gift---gift%1:21:00:: out of the taxpayers---taxpayer%1:18:00:: ' pockets---pocket%1:21:00:: to banks---bank%1:14:00:: , insurance---insurance_company%1:14:00:: and pipeline companies---pipeline_company%1:14:00:: '' .
His contention---contention%1:10:00:: was denied by several bankers---banker%1:18:00:: , including Scott Hudson---person%1:03:00:: of Sherman---location%1:03:00:: , Gaynor B. Jones---person%1:03:00:: of Houston---houston%1:15:00:: , J. B. Brady---person%1:03:00:: of Harlingen---location%1:03:00:: and Howard Cox---person%1:03:00:: of Austin---austin%1:15:00:: .
Cox---person%1:03:00:: argued that the bill---bill%1:10:04:: is `` probably unconstitutional '' since , he said , it would impair contracts---contract%1:10:01:: .
He also complained that not enough notice---notice%1:10:01:: was given on the hearing---hearing%1:04:01:: , since the bill---bill%1:10:04:: was introduced only last Monday---monday%1:28:00:: .
Senators---senator%1:18:00:: unanimously approved Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: the bill---bill%1:10:04:: of Sen.

The bill---bill%1:10:04:: is designed to provide special schooling---schooling%1:04:00:: for more deaf students---student%1:18:00:: in the scholastic age---age%1:28:00:: at a reduced cost---cost%1:07:00:: to the state---state%1:14:00:: .
There was no debate---debate%1:10:00:: as the Senate---senate%1:14:00:: passed the bill---bill%1:10:04:: on to the House---group%1:03:00:: .
It would authorize the Texas Education Agency---group%1:03:00:: to establish county-wide day schools---day_school%1:14:00:: for the deaf---deaf%1:14:00:: in counties---county%1:15:00:: of 300000 or more population---population%1:09:00:: , require deaf children---child%1:18:00:: between 6 and 13 years---year%1:28:01:: of age to attend the day schools---day_school%1:14:00:: , permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf---location%1:03:00:: here .

The TEA---group%1:03:00:: estimated there would be 182 scholastics---scholastic%1:18:00:: to attend the day school---day_school%1:14:00:: in Dallas County---location%1:03:00:: , saving---saving%1:04:02:: them from coming to Austin---austin%1:15:00:: to live in the state---state%1:15:01:: deaf school---school%1:14:00:: .
Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: may get to hear a debate---debate%1:10:00:: on horse race---horse_race%1:11:00:: parimutuels---parimutuel%1:04:00:: soon between Reps. V. E. Red Berry---person%1:03:00:: and Joe Ratcliff---person%1:03:00:: .
While details---details%1:10:00:: are still be to worked out , Ratcliff---person%1:03:00:: said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: why he thinks Berry---person%1:03:00:: 's proposed constitutional amendment---amendment%1:04:00:: should be rejected .
`` We 're getting more ' pro ' letters---letter%1:10:00:: than ' con---con%1:10:00:: ' on horse race---horse_race%1:11:00:: betting '' , said Ratcliff---person%1:03:00:: .
`` But I believe if people---people%1:14:00:: were better informed on this question---question%1:10:01:: , most of them would oppose it also .
I'm willing to stake my political career---career%1:04:00:: on it '' .

A House---group%1:03:00:: committee---committee%1:14:00:: which heard his local option---local_option%1:26:00:: proposal---proposal%1:10:00:: is expected to give it a favorable report---report%1:10:03:: , although the resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: faces hard sledding later .
The House---group%1:03:00:: passed finally , and sent to the Senate---senate%1:14:00:: , a bill---bill%1:10:04:: extending the State Health Department---group%1:03:00:: 's authority---authority%1:07:00:: to give planning---planning%1:04:00:: assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: to cities---city%1:15:00:: .
The Senate---group%1:03:00:: quickly whipped through its meager fare---fare%1:09:00:: of House---group%1:03:00:: bills---bill%1:10:04:: approved by committees---committee%1:14:00:: , passing the three---three%1:23:00:: on the calendar---calendar%1:28:00:: .

State---state%1:15:01:: representatives---representative%1:18:01:: decided Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: against taking a poll on what kind---kind%1:09:00:: of taxes---tax%1:21:00:: Texans---texan%1:18:00:: would prefer to pay .
An adverse vote---vote%1:04:00:: of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee---group%1:03:00:: a bill---bill%1:10:04:: which would order the referendum---referendum%1:04:00:: on the April---april%1:28:00:: 4---4%1:23:00:: ballot---ballot%1:10:00:: , when Texas---texas%1:15:00:: votes on a U.S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: senator---senator%1:18:00:: .

The West Texan---person%1:03:00:: reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell---person%1:03:00:: of the committee---committee%1:14:00:: to set it for public hearing---hearing%1:04:01:: on Feb.---feb%1:28:00:: 22---22%1:23:00:: .

Opponents---opponent%1:18:00:: generally argued that the ballot---ballot%1:10:00:: could n't give enough information---information%1:10:00:: about tax---tax%1:21:00:: proposals---proposal%1:10:00:: for the voters---voter%1:18:00:: to make an intelligent choice---choice%1:09:00:: .
All Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: members---member%1:18:00:: voted with Roberts---person%1:03:00:: , except Rep. Bill Jones---person%1:03:00:: , who was absent .
Paradise---location%1:03:00:: lost to the alleged water---water%1:06:00:: needs---need%1:26:00:: of Texas---texas%1:15:00:: ' big cities---city%1:15:00:: Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: .
Rep. James Cotten---person%1:03:00:: of Weatherford---location%1:03:00:: insisted that a water development---water_development%1:04:00:: bill---bill%1:10:04:: passed by the Texas---texas%1:15:00:: House of Representatives---house_of_representatives%1:14:00:: was an effort---effort%1:04:00:: by big cities---city%1:15:00:: like Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: and Fort Worth---fort_worth%1:15:00:: to cover up places---place%1:15:01:: like Paradise---location%1:03:00:: , a Wise County---location%1:03:00:: hamlet---hamlet%1:14:00:: of 250 people---people%1:14:00:: .
When the shouting---shouting%1:10:00:: ended , the bill---bill%1:10:04:: passed , 114 to 4---4%1:23:00:: , sending it to the Senate---senate%1:14:00:: , where a similar proposal---proposal%1:10:00:: is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse---person%1:03:00:: of Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: .
Most of the fire---fire%1:12:00:: was directed by Cotten---person%1:03:00:: against Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: and Sen. Parkhouse---person%1:03:00:: .
The bill---bill%1:10:04:: would increase from $ 5000000 to $ 15000000 the maximum loan---loan%1:21:00:: the state---state%1:14:01:: could make to a local water project---water_project%1:04:00:: .
Cotten---person%1:03:00:: construed this as a veiled effort---effort%1:04:00:: by Parkhouse---person%1:03:00:: to help Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: and other large cities---city%1:15:00:: get money---money%1:21:00:: which Cotten---person%1:03:00:: felt could better be spent providing water---water%1:27:00:: for rural Texas---texas%1:15:00:: .
Statements---statement%1:10:00:: by other legislators---legislator%1:18:00:: that Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: is paying for all its water program---water_program%1:04:00:: by local bonds---bond%1:21:02:: , and that less populous places---place%1:15:01:: would benefit most by the pending bill---bill%1:10:04:: , did not sway Cotten---person%1:03:00:: 's attack---attack%1:10:00:: .

`` Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: and Fort Worth---fort_worth%1:15:00:: can vote bonds---bond%1:21:02:: .

The report---report%1:10:03:: called racial discrimination---discrimination%1:04:00:: in employment---employment%1:04:02:: `` one of the most serious causes---cause%1:11:00:: of family---family%1:14:02:: breakdown---breakdown%1:04:02:: , desertion---desertion%1:04:00:: , and ADC---group%1:03:00:: dependency---dependency%1:26:00:: '' .
The monthly cost---cost%1:21:00:: of ADC---group%1:03:00:: to more than 100000 recipients---recipient%1:18:00:: in the county---county%1:15:00:: is 4.4 million---million%1:23:00:: dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: , said C. Virgil Martin---person%1:03:00:: , president---president%1:18:01:: of Carson Pirie Scott + Co.---group%1:03:00:: , committee---committee%1:14:00:: chairman---chairman%1:18:01:: .
`` We must solve the problems---problem%1:26:00:: which have forced these people---people%1:14:00:: to depend upon ADC---group%1:03:00:: for subsistence---subsistence%1:21:00:: '' , Martin---person%1:03:00:: said .
The volume---volume%1:07:03:: of ADC---group%1:03:00:: cases---case%1:18:03:: will decrease , Martin---person%1:03:00:: reported , when the community---community%1:14:00:: is able to deal effectively with two problems---problem%1:26:00:: : Relatively limited skills---skill%1:09:01:: and discrimination---discrimination%1:04:00:: in employment---employment%1:04:02:: because of color---color%1:14:00:: .
These , he said , are `` two of the principal underlying causes---cause%1:11:00:: for family---family%1:14:02:: breakups---breakup%1:04:00:: leading to ADC---group%1:03:00:: '' .
Other recommendations---recommendation%1:10:00:: made by the committee---committee%1:14:00:: are :
Extension---extension%1:04:02:: of the ADC---group%1:03:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: to all children---child%1:18:01:: in need---need%1:26:01:: living with any relatives---relative%1:18:00:: , including both parents---parent%1:18:00:: , as a means---means%1:04:00:: of preserving family---family%1:14:02:: unity---unity%1:26:00:: .
Research---research%1:09:00:: projects---project%1:04:00:: as soon as possible on the causes---cause%1:11:00:: and prevention of dependency---dependency%1:26:00:: and illegitimacy---illegitimacy%1:26:00:: .
Most recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: calls for a good deal---good_deal%1:23:00:: of pre planning---planning%1:04:00:: .
This is particularly true in site---site%1:15:00:: selection---selection%1:04:00:: .
You must know before you start what the needs---need%1:17:00:: and objectives---objective%1:09:00:: of your organization---organization%1:14:00:: are ; you must have a list---list%1:10:00:: of requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: on where , how many , and what type---type%1:09:00:: sites---site%1:15:00:: are needed .
With such a program---program%1:09:00:: you can make constructive selections---selection%1:04:00:: of the best sites---site%1:15:00:: available .
Begin the examination---examination%1:04:00:: of a site---site%1:15:00:: with a good map---map%1:06:00:: and aerial photos---photo%1:06:00:: if possible .
These are becoming more and more available through the work---work%1:04:00:: of counties---county%1:15:00:: and other government---government%1:14:00:: agencies---agency%1:14:00:: .
The new editions---new_edition%1:10:00:: of topographic maps---map%1:06:00:: being made by the federal government---federal_government%1:14:00:: are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features---feature%1:09:00:: of the site---site%1:15:00:: .
These are inexpensive and available from the U. S. Geological Society---group%1:03:00:: , washington---washington%1:15:01:: 25 , D. C.---location%1:03:00:: .
In recent years---year%1:28:01:: many counties---county%1:15:00:: and the U. S. Forest Service---group%1:03:00:: have taken aerial photos---photo%1:06:00:: which show features---feature%1:09:00:: in detail and are very good for planning---planning%1:04:00:: use---use%1:04:00:: .
Most counties---county%1:15:00:: also have maps---map%1:06:00:: available from the county---county%1:15:00:: engineer---engineer%1:18:00:: showing roads---road%1:06:00:: and other features---feature%1:09:00:: and from the assessor---assessor%1:18:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: showing ownerships---ownership%1:21:00:: of land---land%1:21:01:: .
Inspect the site---site%1:15:00:: in the field---field%1:15:01:: during the time---time%1:28:00:: of the year---year%1:28:01:: when the area---area%1:15:01:: will be most heavily used for recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: .
This gives you a better opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to get the feel---feel%1:09:00:: of the climate---climate%1:26:00:: conditions---condition%1:26:00:: , the exposure---exposure%1:09:00:: to the sun---sun%1:17:00:: and wind---wind%1:19:00:: , the water---water%1:17:00:: interests---interest%1:07:02:: , etcetera---etcetera%1:06:00:: , which vary greatly with the seasons---season%1:28:00:: .
It is usually helpful to make a sketch map---sketch_map%1:06:00:: in the field---field%1:15:01:: , showing the size---size%1:07:00:: and location---location%1:03:00:: of the features---feature%1:09:00:: of interest---interest%1:07:02:: and to take photographs---photograph%1:06:00:: at the site---site%1:15:00:: .
These are a great aid---aid%1:21:00:: for planning---planning%1:04:00:: use---use%1:04:00:: back at the office---office%1:06:00:: .
For site---site%1:15:00:: planning---planning%1:04:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: , it is best to have a qualified and experienced park---park%1:15:00:: planner---planner%1:18:00:: to carry through the study---study%1:04:00:: .
However , there is also much to be gained by making use---use%1:04:00:: of the abilities---ability%1:09:00:: of the local people---people%1:14:00:: who are available and interested in recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: .
County---county%1:15:00:: judges---judge%1:18:00:: , commissioners---commissioner%1:18:00:: , engineers---engineer%1:18:00:: , assessors---assessor%1:18:00:: , and others who have lived in the area---area%1:15:01:: for a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: may have valuable knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: regarding the site---site%1:15:00:: or opinions---opinion%1:10:01:: to offer from their varied professional experiences---experience%1:09:01:: .
A visit---visit%1:04:02:: to the site---site%1:15:00:: by a group---group%1:03:00:: of several persons---person%1:03:00:: can usually bring out new ideas---idea%1:09:00:: or verify opinions---opinion%1:09:00:: most helpful to the planning---planning%1:04:00:: study---study%1:04:00:: of any recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: .
How much study---study%1:09:04:: is required ?
This , of course , depends on the character---character%1:09:00:: of the site---site%1:15:00:: itself , the previous experience---experience%1:09:01:: of the investigator---investigator%1:18:00:: , and the number---number%1:23:00:: of factors---factor%1:11:00:: needed to arrive at a good decision---decision%1:04:00:: .
It is too easy for the inexperienced person---inexperienced_person%1:18:00:: to make a quick judgment---judgment%1:04:02:: of a few values---value%1:07:00:: of the area---area%1:15:01:: and base a decision---decision%1:04:00:: on these alone .
Usually there are more factors---factor%1:11:00:: to good site---site%1:15:00:: planning---planning%1:04:00:: than first impressions---impression%1:07:00:: .
A site---site%1:15:00:: may be a rundown slum---slum%1:15:00:: or a desolate piece---piece%1:17:00:: of desert---desert%1:15:00:: in appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: today but have excellent potentials---potential%1:26:00:: for the future---future%1:28:00:: with a little development---development%1:04:02:: or water---water%1:27:02:: .
The same is true of areas---area%1:15:01:: which at first look good because of a few existing recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: features---feature%1:09:00:: but may actually be poor areas---area%1:15:01:: to develop for general public use---use%1:04:00:: .
In looking for the best sites---site%1:15:00:: available that meet the requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: , you need information---information%1:09:00:: to compare the site---site%1:15:00:: with others .
You need answers---answer%1:10:01:: to four important questions---question%1:10:00:: .
What are the existing recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: features---feature%1:09:00:: ?
How well can the site---site%1:15:00:: be developed ?
How useful will it be to the public---public%1:14:00:: ?
Is this site---site%1:15:00:: available ?
Check the quantity---quantity%1:03:00:: and quality---quality%1:07:00:: of all of the recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: interests---interest%1:07:02:: already existing at the site---site%1:15:00:: .
Naturally , a park---park%1:15:00:: site---site%1:15:00:: with scenic views---view%1:09:01:: , a good lake---lake%1:17:00:: , trees---tree%1:20:00:: , and sand dunes---sand_dune%1:17:00:: , will attract more people---people%1:14:00:: than a nearby area---area%1:15:01:: with only trees---tree%1:20:00:: and dunes---dune%1:17:00:: .
Quality---quality%1:07:00:: is vitally important .
Frontage---frontage%1:07:00:: on a body---body%1:17:00:: of clear , clean water---water%1:27:00:: will be vastly different from the same amount---amount%1:07:00:: of frontage---frontage%1:07:00:: on polluted water---water%1:17:00:: .
Some recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: features---feature%1:09:00:: , such as scenic values---value%1:07:00:: and water---water%1:17:00:: interest---interest%1:07:02:: , also have greater overall value---value%1:07:00:: than other interests---interest%1:07:02:: .
One of the most desirable features---feature%1:09:00:: for a park---park%1:15:00:: are beautiful views---view%1:09:01:: or scenery---scenery%1:15:00:: .
It may be distant views---view%1:09:01:: of a valley---valley%1:17:00:: or the mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: or natural features---feature%1:09:00:: such as a small lake---lake%1:17:00:: , colorful rock---rock%1:17:01:: formations---formation%1:17:00:: , or unusual trees---tree%1:20:00:: .
A site---site%1:15:00:: which overlooks a harbor---harbor%1:15:00:: or river---river%1:17:00:: may offer interest---interest%1:07:02:: in the activities---activity%1:04:00:: of boating---boating%1:04:00:: traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: .
An area---area%1:15:01:: on the coast---coast%1:17:00:: may have relaxing views---view%1:09:01:: of the surf---surf%1:11:00:: rolling in on a beach---beach%1:17:00:: .
A site---site%1:15:00:: may also be attractive just through the beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: of its trees---tree%1:20:00:: and shrubs---shrub%1:20:00:: .
Note extent---extent%1:07:00:: of these interests---interest%1:07:02:: and how available they will be for the public---public%1:14:00:: to enjoy .
Water---water%1:17:00:: interest---interest%1:07:02:: is one of the most valuable factors---factor%1:11:00:: you can find for a recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: site---site%1:15:00:: .
Most park---park%1:15:00:: planners---planner%1:18:00:: look to water---water%1:17:00:: frontage---frontage%1:07:00:: for basic park---park%1:15:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: .
This follows naturally since frontage---frontage%1:07:00:: on an ocean---ocean%1:17:00:: , stream---stream%1:17:00:: , or lake---lake%1:17:00:: provides scenic values---value%1:07:00:: and opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: for the very popular recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: activities---activity%1:04:00:: of bathing---bathing%1:04:00:: , fishing---fishing%1:04:00:: , boating---boating%1:04:00:: , and other water sports---water_sport%1:04:00:: .
A body of water---body_of_water%1:17:00:: is usually the center---center%1:09:01:: of interest---interest%1:09:00:: at parks---park%1:15:00:: which attract the greatest picnic---picnic%1:28:00:: and camping---camping%1:04:00:: use---use%1:04:00:: .
It also cools the air---air%1:19:00:: in summer---summer%1:28:00:: and nourishes the trees---tree%1:20:00:: and wildlife---wildlife%1:14:00:: .
The amount---amount%1:07:00:: of water---water%1:17:00:: frontage---frontage%1:07:00:: , the quantity---quantity%1:03:00:: and quality---quality%1:07:00:: of the water---water%1:17:00:: , and the recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: afforded by it are important .
A restricted frontage---frontage%1:07:00:: may be too crowded an area---area%1:15:01:: for public---public%1:14:00:: use---use%1:04:00:: .
The quantity---quantity%1:03:00:: of water---water%1:17:00:: flow---flow%1:22:00:: may be critical ; a stream---stream%1:17:00:: or pond---pond%1:17:00:: which is attractive in the springtime---springtime%1:28:00:: may become stagnant or dry in late summer---summer%1:28:00:: .
If the site---site%1:15:00:: is on a reservoir---reservoir%1:06:01:: , the level---level%1:07:01:: of the water---water%1:17:00:: at various seasons---season%1:28:00:: as it affects recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: should be studied .
Check the quality---quality%1:07:00:: of the water---water%1:27:00:: .
A stream---stream%1:17:00:: which has all of its watershed---watershed%1:15:00:: within a national forest---forest%1:14:00:: or other lands---land%1:21:01:: under good conservation---conservation%1:11:00:: practices---practice%1:04:00:: is less likely to be affected by pollution---pollution%1:26:00:: than one passing through unrestricted logging---logging%1:04:00:: or past an industrial area---area%1:15:01:: .
Other factors---factor%1:11:00:: , such as water---water%1:17:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: , depth---depth%1:07:00:: of water---water%1:17:00:: , the fish---fish%1:05:00:: life---life%1:03:00:: it supports , wave---wave%1:11:01:: action---action%1:22:00:: , flooding , etcetera---etcetera%1:06:00:: , will affect its recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: value---value%1:07:00:: .
Other natural features---feature%1:09:00:: which can be of high interest---interest%1:09:00:: are the forests---forest%1:14:00:: , canyons---canyon%1:17:00:: , mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: , deserts---desert%1:15:00:: , seacoast---seacoast%1:17:00:: , beaches---beach%1:17:00:: , sand dunes---sand_dune%1:17:00:: , waterfalls---waterfall%1:17:00:: , springs---spring%1:17:00:: , etcetera---etcetera%1:06:00:: with which the area---area%1:15:01:: is blessed .
Just as the national and state parks---park%1:15:00:: place emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: on features---feature%1:09:00:: which are of national or state significance---significance%1:07:00:: , counties---county%1:15:00:: should seek out these features---feature%1:09:00:: which are distinctive of their area---area%1:15:01:: .
Although the site---site%1:15:00:: may not contain the features---feature%1:09:00:: themselves , there are often opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: to include them as additional interest---interest%1:09:00:: to the site---site%1:15:00:: .
The route---route%1:06:00:: to the park---park%1:15:00:: may lead people---people%1:14:00:: past them or display views---view%1:09:01:: of them .
A group---group%1:03:00:: of native trees---tree%1:20:00:: or plants---plant%1:03:00:: which are outstanding in a particular county---county%1:15:00:: can be featured at the site---site%1:15:00:: .
The fish---fish%1:05:00:: , animals---animal%1:03:00:: , and birds---bird%1:05:00:: which may be found at the site---site%1:15:00:: are another interest---interest%1:09:00:: .
Fishing---fishing%1:04:00:: interest---interest%1:09:00:: calls for a check---check%1:09:00:: of the species---species%1:14:00:: found , quantity---quantity%1:03:00:: and size---size%1:07:00:: , the season---season%1:28:00:: they are available , and the stocking---stocking%1:04:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: of the fish---fish%1:05:00:: commission---commission%1:14:00:: .
Animals---animal%1:03:00:: may be present at the site---site%1:15:00:: or provide hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: in nearby areas---area%1:15:01:: .
The site---site%1:15:00:: may be on one of the major flyways---flyway%1:15:00:: of migratory birds---bird%1:05:00:: or have its own resident bird---bird%1:05:00:: life---life%1:03:00:: .
Clams---clam%1:05:00:: , crabs---crab%1:05:00:: , and other marine life---life%1:03:00:: may add interest---interest%1:07:02:: at coastal areas---area%1:15:01:: .
Each area---area%1:15:01:: has its own historical interests---interest%1:07:02:: with which much can be done .
Park---park%1:15:00:: visitors---visitor%1:18:00:: are always eager to learn more about the area---area%1:15:01:: they are in .
The historical sign---sign%1:10:00:: tells its story---story%1:10:03:: , but nothing gets interest---interest%1:09:00:: across as well as some of the original historical items---item%1:06:00:: or places---place%1:15:00:: themselves which still have the character---character%1:09:00:: of the period---period%1:28:00:: covered .
Notice should be taken of unusual rock---rock%1:17:01:: formations---formation%1:17:00:: , deposits---deposit%1:19:00:: , or shapes---shape%1:07:00:: of the earth---earth%1:17:00:: 's crust---crust%1:17:00:: in your region---region%1:15:00:: .
Those which tell a story---story%1:10:03:: of the earth---earth%1:17:00:: 's formation---formation%1:17:00:: in each area---area%1:15:01:: can add geological interest---interest%1:07:02:: to the recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: sites---site%1:15:00:: .
An old shipwreck---shipwreck%1:06:00:: , a high dam---dam%1:06:00:: , an old covered bridge---bridge%1:06:00:: , a place---place%1:15:00:: to find agates---agate%1:27:00:: or other semi-precious stones---stone%1:17:00:: or a place---place%1:15:00:: to pan gold---gold%1:21:00:: , etcetera---etcetera%1:06:00:: may be of interest---interest%1:09:00:: .
Some areas---area%1:15:01:: may provide archeological values---value%1:07:00:: such as ancient Indian village---village%1:14:00:: sites---site%1:15:00:: or hunting---hunting%1:04:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: , caves---cave%1:17:00:: , artifacts---artifact%1:03:00:: , etcetera---etcetera%1:06:00:: .
How well can the site---site%1:15:00:: be developed ?
Look at the physical features---feature%1:09:00:: of the land---land%1:21:01:: to determine how desirable it is for use---use%1:04:00:: , what can be done to correct the faults---fault%1:26:00:: , and what it will cost to make the area---area%1:15:01:: meet your needs---need%1:17:00:: in comparison to other sites---site%1:15:00:: .
Many things---thing%1:09:02:: need to be checked .
The size---size%1:07:00:: of the area---area%1:15:01:: alone can be a determining factor---determining_factor%1:09:00:: .
An area---area%1:15:01:: may be too small for the needs---need%1:17:00:: of the project---project%1:04:00:: .
Areas---area%1:15:01:: should be large enough to include the attractions---attraction%1:10:00:: , have ample space---space%1:15:00:: for the use---use%1:04:00:: of facilities---facility%1:06:00:: needed , and have room---room%1:23:00:: around the edges---edge%1:15:00:: to protect the values---value%1:21:00:: of the area---area%1:15:01:: from encroachment---encroachment%1:11:00:: by private developments---development%1:15:00:: .
Acreage---acreage%1:07:00:: in excess of the minimum---minimum%1:23:00:: is good practice---practice%1:04:00:: as recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: are never too large for the future---future%1:28:00:: and it is often more economical to operate one large area---area%1:15:01:: than several small ones .
Shape---shape%1:07:00:: of the area---area%1:15:01:: is also related to the use---use%1:04:00:: attractions---attraction%1:10:00:: and needs---need%1:17:00:: of the development---development%1:15:00:: .
A large picnic area---picnic_area%1:15:00:: or camping---camping%1:04:00:: development---development%1:15:00:: is most efficient in shape---shape%1:07:00:: as a square---square%1:25:00:: or rectangle---rectangle%1:25:00:: several hundred feet---foot%1:23:00:: in width in preference to a long narrow area---area%1:15:01:: less than one hundred feet---foot%1:23:00:: wide .
This is true because of savings---saving%1:04:00:: in utility---utility%1:14:00:: lines---line%1:06:01:: and the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that your buildings---building%1:06:00:: have a useful radius---radius%1:15:00:: equal in all directions---direction%1:15:00:: .
However , a narrow strip---strip%1:17:00:: may be very practical for small developments---development%1:15:00:: , or to provide additional stream---stream%1:17:00:: frontage---frontage%1:07:00:: for a fisherman---fisherman%1:18:00:: 's trail---trail%1:06:00:: , or include scenic strips---strip%1:17:00:: within the park---park%1:15:00:: unit .
The values---value%1:21:00:: of the site---site%1:15:00:: may be affected by the appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: of the adjoining lands---land%1:21:01:: , ownership---ownership%1:04:00:: and use---use%1:04:00:: of the land---land%1:21:01:: , and the utilities---utility%1:14:00:: available there .
For instance , a site---site%1:15:00:: adjoining other publicly owned lands---land%1:21:01:: , such as a national forest---forest%1:14:00:: or a public---public%1:14:00:: road---road%1:06:00:: , may be desirable , whereas a site---site%1:15:00:: next to an industrial plant---plant%1:06:01:: might not .
The utilities---utility%1:14:00:: available nearby may provide a savings---saving%1:04:00:: in the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of extending electricity---electricity%1:19:01:: or water---water%1:06:00:: to the site---site%1:15:00:: .
- Topography---topography%1:07:00:: is very important .
Check---check%1:09:00:: the elevation---elevation%1:24:00:: of the ground---ground%1:17:00:: , degree---degree%1:23:00:: and direction---direction%1:24:00:: of slopes---slope%1:17:00:: , drainage---drainage%1:04:00:: , rock outcrops---rock_outcrop%1:17:00:: , topsoil---topsoil%1:27:00:: types---type%1:09:00:: and quality---quality%1:07:00:: , as well as subsoil---subsoil%1:27:00:: .
Nearly level areas---area%1:15:01:: are required for parking areas---parking_area%1:15:00:: , beaches---beach%1:17:00:: , camp---camp%1:06:01:: areas---area%1:06:00:: , ball fields---ball_field%1:06:00:: , etcetera---etcetera%1:06:00:: .
Determine how much topography---topography%1:07:00:: limits useful area---area%1:15:01:: or what the costs---cost%1:21:00:: of earth---earth%1:27:00:: moving or grading---grading%1:04:00:: might be .
- In addition to its recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: interests---interest%1:07:02:: , water---water%1:27:00:: is needed for drinking---drinking%1:04:00:: , sanitation---sanitation%1:04:00:: , and irrigation---irrigation%1:04:00:: .
The quantity---quantity%1:03:00:: and quality---quality%1:07:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: sources---source%1:15:00:: is often a big factor---factor%1:11:00:: in site---site%1:15:00:: selection---selection%1:04:00:: .
The area---area%1:15:01:: may provide good springs---spring%1:17:00:: or opportunities---opportunity%1:26:00:: for a well---well%1:06:00:: or be near to municipal water lines---water_line%1:15:00:: .
Figure the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of providing water---water%1:27:00:: to the use---use%1:04:00:: areas---area%1:15:01:: .
- The existing plant---plant%1:03:00:: growth---growth%1:14:00:: calls for thorough checking .
Look at the trees---tree%1:20:00:: as to size---size%1:07:00:: and interest---interest%1:07:02:: , the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of shade---shade%1:26:00:: they provide , how healthy they are , the problems---problem%1:26:00:: of maintenance---maintenance%1:04:00:: , fire---fire%1:11:00:: hazards---hazard%1:26:00:: , wind---wind%1:19:00:: throw---throw%1:04:00:: , etcetera---etcetera%1:06:00:: .
An area---area%1:15:01:: may have been partially logged and requires removal---removal%1:04:00:: of stumps---stump%1:20:00:: or clean up .
Some shrubs---shrub%1:20:00:: may be of good landscaping---landscaping%1:04:00:: value---value%1:07:00:: , other areas---area%1:15:01:: of brush---brush%1:14:00:: may need to be cleared .
The extent---extent%1:07:00:: and location---location%1:03:00:: of open areas---area%1:15:01:: is noted .
- How much will wind---wind%1:19:00:: , rain---rain%1:19:00:: , sun---sun%1:19:00:: , and temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: affect the use---use%1:04:00:: ?
An area---area%1:15:01:: sheltered from strong winds---wind%1:19:00:: may be highly desirable for recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: use---use%1:04:00:: .
The direction---direction%1:24:00:: , velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: , and season---season%1:28:00:: of these winds---wind%1:19:00:: should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation---recreation%1:04:00:: use---use%1:04:00:: and your maintenance---maintenance%1:04:00:: and operation---operation%1:04:03:: of the area---area%1:15:01:: .
Lack---lack%1:26:00:: of rainfall---rainfall%1:19:00:: and extreme temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: may call for the development---development%1:04:02:: of shade---shade%1:26:00:: and irrigation---irrigation%1:04:00:: of a site---site%1:15:00:: to make it useable .
Sometimes , you have a choice---choice%1:04:00:: of exposure---exposure%1:09:00:: for sites---site%1:15:00:: where the topography---topography%1:07:00:: or trees---tree%1:20:00:: of the area---area%1:15:01:: will provide afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: shade---shade%1:26:00:: , morning---morning%1:28:00:: sun---sun%1:19:00:: , or whatever may be most desirable for the use---use%1:04:00:: intended .
- Some areas---area%1:15:01:: may already have been improved and contain buildings---building%1:06:00:: , roads---road%1:06:00:: , utilities---utility%1:14:00:: , cleared land---land%1:21:01:: , etcetera---etcetera%1:06:00:: which may raise the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of the site---site%1:15:00:: .
Whenever artists---artist%1:18:00:: , indeed , turned to actual representations---representation%1:06:00:: or molded three-dimensional figures---three-dimensional_figure%1:25:00:: , which were rare down to 800 B.C. , they tended to reflect reality---reality%1:09:00:: ( see Plate---plate%1:06:06:: 6a , 9b ) ; a schematic , abstract treatment---treatment%1:07:00:: of men---man%1:05:01:: and animals---animal%1:03:00:: , by intent---intent%1:10:00:: , rose only in the late eighth century---century%1:28:00:: .
To speak of this underlying view---view%1:09:02:: of the world---world%1:17:01:: is to embark upon matters---matter%1:09:00:: of subjective judgment---judgment%1:09:00:: .
At the least , however , one may conclude that Geometric potters---potter%1:18:00:: sensed a logical order---order%1:26:02:: ; their principles---principle%1:09:03:: of composition---composition%1:04:01:: stand very close to those which appear in the Homeric epics---epic%1:10:00:: and the hexameter---hexameter%1:10:00:: line---line%1:10:02:: .
Their world---world%1:09:00:: , again , was a still simple , traditional age---age%1:28:02:: which was only slowly beginning to appreciate the complexity---complexity%1:07:00:: of life---life%1:09:00:: .
And perhaps an observer---observer%1:18:01:: of the vases---vase%1:06:00:: will not go too far in deducing that the outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: of their makers---maker%1:18:00:: and users---user%1:18:00:: was basically stable and secure .
The storms---storm%1:26:00:: of the past---past%1:28:00:: had died away , and the great upheaval---upheaval%1:26:00:: which was to mark the following century---century%1:28:00:: had not yet begun to disturb men 's minds---mind%1:09:00:: .
Throughout the work---work%1:06:00:: of the later ninth century---century%1:28:00:: a calm , severe serenity---serenity%1:12:00:: displays itself .
In the vases---vase%1:06:00:: this spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: may perhaps at times bore or repel one in its internal self-satisfaction---self-satisfaction%1:12:00:: , but the best of the Geometric pins---pin%1:06:01:: have rightly been considered among the most beautiful ever made in the Greek---greek%1:10:00:: world---world%1:14:01:: .
The ninth century---century%1:28:00:: was in its artistic work---work%1:06:00:: `` the spiritually freest and most self-sufficient between past---past%1:28:00:: and future---future%1:28:00:: '' , and the loving skill---skill%1:09:01:: spent by its artists---artist%1:18:00:: upon their products---product%1:06:00:: is a testimonial---testimonial%1:10:02:: to their sense---sense%1:09:05:: that what they were doing was important and was appreciated .
Geometric pottery---pottery%1:06:00:: has not yet received the thorough , detailed study---study%1:04:00:: which it deserves , partly because the task---task%1:04:01:: is a mammoth one and partly because some of its local manifestations---manifestation%1:11:00:: , as at Argos---location%1:03:00:: , are only now coming to light .
From even a cursory inspection of its many aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: , however , the historian---historian%1:18:00:: can deduce several fundamental conclusions---conclusion%1:09:00:: about the progress---progress%1:11:00:: of the Aegean---aegean%1:17:00:: world---world%1:14:01:: down to 800 B.C.
The general intellectual outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: which had appeared in the eleventh century---century%1:28:00:: was now consolidated to a significant degree---degree%1:26:01:: .
In this process the Minoan Mycenaean inheritance---inheritance%1:04:00:: had been transmuted or finally rejected ; the Aegean world---world%1:14:01:: which had existed before 1000 differed from that which rises more clearly in our vision---vision%1:09:01:: after 800 .
Those modern scholars---scholar%1:18:00:: who urge that we must keep in mind---mind%1:09:00:: the fundamental continuity---continuity%1:26:00:: of Aegean development---development%1:22:02:: from earliest times---times%1:28:01:: - granted occasional irruptions---irruption%1:04:00:: of peoples---people%1:14:00:: and ideas---idea%1:09:00:: from outside---outside%1:15:01:: - are correct ; but all too many observers---observer%1:18:01:: have been misled by this fact---fact%1:09:01:: into minimizing the degree---degree%1:26:01:: of change---change%1:24:00:: which took place in the early first millennium---millennium%1:28:00:: .
The focus---focus%1:09:00:: of novelty---novelty%1:07:00:: in this world---world%1:14:01:: now lay in the south-eastern districts---district%1:15:00:: of the Greek mainland---mainland%1:17:00:: , and by 800 virtually the entire Aegean---aegean%1:17:00:: , always excepting its northern shores---shore%1:17:00:: , had accepted the Geometric style---style%1:07:00:: of pottery---pottery%1:06:00:: .
While Protogeometric vases---vase%1:06:00:: usually turn up , especially outside Greece---greece%1:15:00:: proper , together with as many or more examples---example%1:09:00:: of local stamp---stamp%1:25:00:: , these `` non Greek '' patterns---pattern%1:06:00:: had mostly vanished by the later ninth century---century%1:28:00:: .
In their place---place%1:04:01:: came local variations---variation%1:11:01:: within the common style---style%1:07:00:: - tentative , as it were , in Protogeometric products---product%1:06:00:: but truly distinct and sharply defined as the Geometric spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: developed .
Attica---attica%1:15:00:: , though important , was not the only teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: of this age---age%1:28:02:: .
One can take a vase---vase%1:06:00:: of about 800 B.C. and , without any knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of its place of origin---place_of_origin%1:15:00:: , venture to assign it to a specific area---area%1:15:01:: ; imitation---imitation%1:04:00:: and borrowing---borrowing%1:04:01:: of motifs---motif%1:06:00:: now become ascertainable .
The potters---potter%1:18:00:: of the Aegean islands---aegean_island%1:15:00:: thus stood apart from those of the mainland---mainland%1:17:00:: , and in Greece---greece%1:15:00:: itself Argive , Corinthian , Attic , Boeotian , and other Geometric sequences---sequence%1:14:00:: have each their own hallmarks---hallmark%1:07:00:: .
These local variations---variation%1:11:01:: were to become ever sharper in the next century---century%1:28:00:: and a half---half%1:23:00:: .
The same conclusions---conclusion%1:09:00:: can be drawn from the other physical evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: of the Dark ages---dark_ages%1:28:00:: , from linguistic distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: , and from the survivals---survival%1:26:00:: of early social , political , and religious patterns---pattern%1:04:00:: into later ages---age%1:28:02:: .
By 800 B.C. the Aegean---aegean%1:17:00:: was an area---area%1:15:01:: of common tongue---tongue%1:10:00:: and of common culture---culture%1:09:00:: .
On these pillars---pillar%1:09:00:: rested that solid basis---basis%1:24:00:: for life---life%1:26:00:: and thought---thought%1:09:02:: which was soon to be manifested in the remarkably unlimited ken---ken%1:09:00:: of the Iliad---iliad%1:10:00:: .
Everywhere within the common pattern---pattern%1:09:01:: , however , one finds local diversity---diversity%1:07:02:: ; Greek history---history%1:28:00:: and culture---culture%1:14:00:: were enduringly fertilized , and plagued , by the interplay---interplay%1:04:00:: of these conjoined yet opposed factors---factor%1:11:00:: .
Further we cannot go , for the Dark ages---dark_ages%1:28:00:: deserve their name---name%1:10:00:: .
Many aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: were not yet sufficiently crystallized to find expression---expression%1:10:04:: , nor could the simple economic and social foundations---foundation%1:24:00:: of this world---world%1:14:01:: support a lofty structure---structure%1:06:00:: .
The epic poems---epic_poem%1:10:00:: , the consolidation---consolidation%1:11:00:: of the Greek pantheon---pantheon%1:14:00:: , the rise---rise%1:11:00:: of firm political units---political_unit%1:14:00:: , the self-awareness---self-awareness%1:09:00:: which could permit painted and sculptured representations---representation%1:06:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: - all these had to await the progress---progress%1:04:01:: of following decades---decade%1:28:00:: .
What we have seen in this chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: , we have seen only dimly , and yet the results---result%1:19:00:: , however general , are worth the search---search%1:04:02:: .
These are the centuries---century%1:28:00:: in which the inhabitants---inhabitant%1:18:00:: of the Aegean world---world%1:14:01:: settled firmly into their minds---mind%1:09:00:: and into their institutions---institution%1:14:00:: the foundations---foundation%1:06:00:: of the Hellenic outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: , independent of outside forces---force%1:07:01:: .
To interpret , indeed , the era---era%1:28:00:: from 1000 to 800 as a period---period%1:28:00:: mainly of consolidation---consolidation%1:04:00:: may be a necessary but unfortunate defect---defect%1:07:01:: born of our lack---lack%1:26:00:: of detailed information---information%1:09:00:: ; if we could see more deeply , we probably would find many side issues---issue%1:09:01:: and wrong turnings---turning%1:04:01:: which came to an end---end%1:26:00:: within the period---period%1:28:00:: .
The historian---historian%1:18:00:: can only point out those lines---line%1:14:02:: which were major enough to find reflection---reflection%1:10:01:: in our limited evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: , and must hope that future excavations---excavation%1:04:01:: will enrich our understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: .
Throughout the Dark ages---dark_ages%1:28:00:: , it is clear , the Greek world---world%1:14:01:: had been developing slowly but consistently .
The pace---pace%1:28:00:: could now be accelerated , for the inhabitants---inhabitant%1:18:00:: of the Aegean---aegean%1:17:00:: stood on firm ground .
The landscape of Greek history---history%1:28:00:: broadens widely , and rather abruptly , in the eighth century---century%1:28:00:: B.C. , the age---age%1:28:02:: of Homer---homer%1:18:00:: 's `` rosy fingered Dawn---dawn%1:28:00:: '' .
The first slanting rays---ray%1:19:00:: of the new day---day%1:28:02:: cannot yet dispel all the dark shadows---shadow%1:26:01:: which lie across the Aegean world---world%1:14:01:: ; but our evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: grows considerably in variety---variety%1:07:00:: and shows more unmistakably some of the lines---line%1:14:02:: of change---change%1:24:00:: .
For this period---period%1:28:00:: , as for earlier centuries---century%1:28:00:: , pottery---pottery%1:06:00:: remains the most secure source---source%1:10:00:: ; the ceramic material---material%1:27:00:: of the age---age%1:28:02:: is more abundant , more diversified , and more indicative of the hopes---hope%1:12:01:: and fears---fear%1:12:00:: of its makers---maker%1:18:00:: , who begin to show scenes---scene%1:09:00:: of human life---life%1:26:02:: and death---death%1:26:00:: .
Figurines---figurine%1:06:00:: and simple chapels---chapel%1:06:00:: presage the emergence---emergence%1:11:01:: of sculpture---sculpture%1:04:00:: and architecture---architecture%1:06:00:: in Greece---greece%1:15:00:: ; objects---object%1:03:00:: in gold---gold%1:27:00:: , ivory---ivory%1:27:00:: , and bronze---bronze%1:27:00:: grow more numerous .
Since writing---writing%1:04:01:: was practiced in the Aegean---aegean%1:17:00:: before the end---end%1:28:00:: of the century---century%1:28:00:: , we may hope that the details---detail%1:09:00:: of tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: will now be occasionally useful .
Though it is not easy to apply the evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: of the Iliad---iliad%1:10:00:: to any specific era---era%1:28:00:: , this marvelous product---product%1:06:00:: of the epic tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: had certainly taken definitive shape by 750 .
The Dipylon Geometric pottery---pottery%1:06:00:: of Athens---athens%1:15:00:: and the Iliad---iliad%1:10:00:: are amazing manifestations---manifestation%1:10:00:: of the inherent potentialities---potentiality%1:26:00:: of Greek civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: ; but both were among the last products---product%1:06:00:: of a phase---phase%1:28:00:: which was ending .
Greek civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: was swirling toward its great revolution---revolution%1:11:01:: , in which the developed qualities---quality%1:07:01:: of the Hellenic outlook---outlook%1:09:01:: were suddenly to break forth .
The revolution---revolution%1:11:01:: was well under way before 700 B.C. , and premonitory signs---sign%1:10:05:: go back virtually across the century---century%1:28:00:: .
The era---era%1:28:00:: , however , is Janus-faced .
While many tokens---token%1:10:00:: point forward , the main achievements---achievement%1:04:00:: stand as a culmination---culmination%1:28:00:: of the simple patterns---pattern%1:04:00:: of the Dark ages---dark_ages%1:28:00:: .
The dominant pottery---pottery%1:06:00:: of the century---century%1:28:00:: was Geometric ; political organization---organization%1:14:00:: revolved about the basileis---basileus%1:18:00:: ; trade---trade%1:04:05:: was just beginning to expand ; the gods---god%1:18:01:: who protected the Greek countryside---countryside%1:15:00:: were only now putting on their sharply anthropomorphic dress---dress%1:06:01:: .
The modern student---student%1:18:01:: , who knows what was to come next , is likely to place first the factors---factor%1:11:00:: of change---change%1:19:00:: which are visible in the eighth century---century%1:28:00:: .
Not all men---man%1:18:00:: of the period---period%1:28:00:: would have accepted this emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: .
Many potters---potter%1:18:00:: clung to the past---past%1:28:00:: the more determinedly as they were confronted with radically new ideas---idea%1:09:00:: ; the poet---poet%1:18:00:: of the Iliad---iliad%1:10:00:: deliberately archaized .
Although it is not possible to sunder old and new in this era---era%1:28:00:: , I shall consider in the present chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: primarily the first decades---decade%1:28:00:: of the eighth century---century%1:28:00:: and shall interpret them as an apogee---apogee%1:28:00:: of the first stage---stage%1:28:00:: of Greek civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: .
On this principle---principle%1:09:03:: of division---division%1:04:00:: I must postpone the evolution---evolution%1:22:01:: of sculpture---sculpture%1:04:00:: , architecture---architecture%1:06:00:: , society---society%1:14:00:: , and politics---politics%1:24:00:: ; for the developments---development%1:22:02:: in these areas---area%1:09:00:: make sense only if they are connected to the age---age%1:28:02:: of revolution---revolution%1:11:01:: itself .
The growing contacts---contact%1:04:02:: between Aegean---aegean%1:17:00:: and Orient---orient%1:15:00:: are also a phase---phase%1:28:00:: which should be linked primarily to the remarkable broadening---broadening%1:04:00:: of Hellenic culture---culture%1:09:01:: after 750 .
We shall not be able entirely to pass over these connections---connection%1:09:00:: to the East---east%1:15:00:: as we consider Ripe Geometric pottery---pottery%1:06:00:: , the epic---epic%1:10:00:: and the myth---myth%1:10:00:: , and the religious evolution---evolution%1:22:01:: of early Greece---greece%1:15:00:: ; the important point---point%1:09:01:: , however , is that these magnificent achievements---achievement%1:04:00:: , unlike those of later decades---decade%1:28:00:: , were only incidentally influenced by Oriental models---model%1:09:01:: .
The antecedents---antecedent%1:11:00:: of Dipylon vases---vase%1:06:00:: and of the Iliad---iliad%1:10:00:: lie in the Aegean past---past%1:28:00:: .
The pottery---pottery%1:06:00:: of the first half---first_half%1:28:00:: of the eighth century---century%1:28:00:: is commonly called Ripe Geometric .
The severe yet harmonious vases---vase%1:06:00:: of the previous fifty years---year%1:28:01:: , the Strong Geometric style---style%1:07:00:: of the late ninth century---century%1:28:00:: , display as firm a mastery---mastery%1:09:00:: of the principles---principle%1:09:03:: underlying Geometric pottery---pottery%1:06:00:: ; but artists---artist%1:18:00:: now were ready to refine and elaborate their inheritance---inheritance%1:04:00:: .
The vases---vase%1:06:00:: which resulted had different shapes---shape%1:07:00:: , far more complex decoration---decoration%1:06:00:: , and a larger sense---sense%1:09:05:: of style---style%1:07:00:: .
Beyond the aesthetic and technical aspects---aspect%1:09:00:: of this expansion---expansion%1:04:00:: we must consider the change---change%1:24:00:: in pottery---pottery%1:06:00:: style---style%1:07:00:: on broader lines---line%1:09:01:: .
In earlier centuries---century%1:28:00:: men---man%1:18:00:: had had enough---enough%1:23:00:: to do in rebuilding a fundamental sense---sense%1:09:05:: of order---order%1:26:00:: after chaos---chaos%1:26:00:: .
They had had to work on very simple foundations---foundation%1:24:00:: and had not dared to give rein to impulses---impulse%1:12:01:: .
The potters---potter%1:18:00:: , in particular , had virtually eschewed freehand drawing---drawing%1:10:00:: , elaborate motifs---motif%1:06:00:: , and the curving lines---line%1:25:00:: of nature , while yet expressing a belief---belief%1:09:00:: that there was order---order%1:26:02:: in the universe---universe%1:17:00:: .
In their vases---vase%1:06:00:: were embodied the basic aesthetic and logical characteristics---characteristic%1:07:00:: of Greek civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: , at first hesitantly in Protogeometric work---work%1:06:00:: , and then more confidently in the initial stages---stage%1:28:00:: of the Geometric style---style%1:07:00:: .
By 800 social and cultural security---security%1:26:00:: had been achieved , at least on a simple plane---plane%1:26:00:: ; it was time---time%1:28:06:: to take bigger steps---step%1:04:02:: , to venture on experiments---experiment%1:04:01:: .
Ripe Geometric potters---potter%1:18:00:: continued to employ the old syntax---syntax%1:14:00:: of ornaments---ornament%1:06:00:: and shapes---shape%1:03:00:: and made use---use%1:04:00:: of the well-defined though limited range---range%1:07:00:: of motifs---motif%1:06:00:: which they had inherited .
In these respects---respect%1:09:00:: the vases---vase%1:06:00:: of the early eighth century---century%1:28:00:: represent a culmination---culmination%1:28:00:: of earlier lines---line%1:14:02:: of progress---progress%1:04:01:: .
To the ancestral lore---lore%1:09:00:: , however , new materials---material%1:27:00:: were added .
Painters---painter%1:18:00:: left less and less of a vase---vase%1:06:00:: in a plain dark color---color%1:07:00:: ; instead they divided the surface---surface%1:06:00:: into many bands---band%1:06:01:: or covered it by all-over patterns---pattern%1:06:00:: into which freehand drawing---drawing%1:04:01:: began to creep .
Wavy lines---line%1:25:00:: , feather---feather%1:05:00:: like patterns---pattern%1:06:00:: , rosettes---rosette%1:06:00:: of indefinitely floral nature---nature%1:07:02:: , birds---bird%1:05:00:: either singly or in stylized rows---row%1:14:00:: , animals---animal%1:03:00:: in solemn frieze---frieze%1:06:01:: bands---band%1:06:01:: ( see Plates---plate%1:06:06:: 11 - 12 ) - all these turned up in the more developed fabrics---fabric%1:06:00:: as preliminary signs---sign%1:10:05:: that the potters---potter%1:18:00:: were broadening their gaze---gaze%1:04:00:: .
The rows---row%1:14:00:: of animals---animal%1:03:00:: and birds---bird%1:05:00:: , in particular , suggest awareness---awareness%1:09:00:: of Oriental animal---animal%1:03:00:: friezes---frieze%1:06:01:: , transmitted perhaps via Syrian silver bowls---bowl%1:06:01:: and textiles---textile%1:06:00:: , but the specific forms---form%1:07:00:: of these rows---row%1:14:00:: on local vases---vase%1:06:00:: and metal products---product%1:06:00:: are nonetheless Greek .
Though the spread---spread%1:11:00:: of this type---type%1:09:00:: of decoration---decoration%1:06:00:: in the Aegean---aegean%1:17:00:: has not yet been precisely determined , it seems to appear first in the Cyclades---cyclades%1:14:00:: , which were among the leading exporters---exporter%1:18:00:: of pottery---pottery%1:06:00:: throughout the century---century%1:28:00:: .
As the material---material%1:27:00:: at the command---command%1:07:02:: of the potters---potter%1:18:00:: grew and the volume---volume%1:07:03:: of their production---production%1:06:00:: increased , the local variations---variation%1:11:01:: within a common style---style%1:07:00:: became more evident .
Plate---plate%1:06:06:: 12 illustrates four examples---example%1:09:00:: , which are Ripe or Late Geometric work---work%1:06:00:: of common spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: but of different schools---school%1:14:02:: .
Beth---person%1:03:00:: was very still and her breath---breath%1:04:00:: came in small jerking gasps---gasp%1:04:00:: .
The thin legs---leg%1:08:01:: twitched convulsively once , then Kate---person%1:03:00:: felt the little body---body%1:08:00:: stiffening in her arms---arm%1:08:00:: and heard one strangled sound---sound%1:19:00:: .
The scant flesh---flesh%1:08:02:: grew cool beneath her frantic hands---hand%1:08:00:: .
The child---child%1:18:01:: was gone .
When Juanita---person%1:03:00:: awoke , Kate---person%1:03:00:: was still rocking the dead child---child%1:18:01:: , still crooning in disbelief---disbelief%1:09:00:: , `` No---no%1:10:00:: , no---no%1:10:00:: , oh , no---no%1:10:00:: ! ''
They put Kate---person%1:03:00:: to bed---bed%1:06:00:: and wired Jonathan---person%1:03:00:: and sent for the young Presbyterian---presbyterian%1:18:00:: minister---minister%1:18:00:: .
He sat beside Kate---person%1:03:00:: 's bed---bed%1:06:00:: with the others throughout the morning---morning%1:28:00:: , talking , talking of God---god%1:18:00:: 's will---will%1:09:00:: , while Kate---person%1:03:00:: lay staring angrily at him .
When he told her God---god%1:18:00:: had called the child---child%1:18:01:: to Him , she rejected his words---word%1:10:04:: rebelliously .
Few of the neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: came , but Mrs. Tussle---person%1:03:00:: came , called by tragedy---tragedy%1:11:00:: .
`` It always comes in threes---three%1:23:00:: '' , she sighed heavily .
`` Trouble---trouble%1:11:00:: never comes but in threes---three%1:23:00:: '' .
They held the funeral---funeral%1:11:00:: the next morning---morning%1:28:00:: from the crossroads---crossroads%1:14:00:: church---church%1:06:00:: and buried the little box---box%1:06:00:: in the quiet family---family%1:14:00:: plot---plot%1:15:00:: .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: moved through all the preparations---preparation%1:04:02:: and services---service%1:04:01:: in a state---state%1:03:00:: of bewilderment---bewilderment%1:09:00:: .
She would not accept the death---death%1:11:00:: of such a little child---child%1:18:01:: .
`` God---god%1:18:00:: called her to Him '' , the minister---minister%1:18:00:: had said .
God---god%1:18:00:: would not do that , Kate---person%1:03:00:: thought stubbornly .
Jonathan---person%1:03:00:: 's letter---letter%1:10:00:: came , as she knew it would , and he had accepted their child---child%1:18:01:: 's death---death%1:11:00:: as another judgment---judgment%1:09:00:: from God---god%1:18:00:: against both Kate---person%1:03:00:: and himself .
In blind panic---panic%1:26:01:: of grief---grief%1:12:00:: she accepted Jonathan---person%1:03:00:: 's dictum---dictum%1:10:00:: , and believed in her desperation---desperation%1:26:01:: that she had been cursed by God---god%1:18:00:: .
She held Jonathan---person%1:03:00:: 's letter---letter%1:10:00:: , his words---word%1:10:00:: burning like a brand---brand%1:10:02:: , and knew suddenly that the bonds---bond%1:24:00:: between them were severed .
She had nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: left but her duty---duty%1:04:00:: to his land---land%1:21:00:: and his son---son%1:18:00:: .
Joel---person%1:03:00:: came and sat mutely with her , sharing her pain---pain%1:12:00:: and anguish---anguish%1:12:02:: , averting his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: from the ice packs---ice_pack%1:06:00:: on her bosom---bosom%1:06:00:: .
Juanita---person%1:03:00:: and Mrs. Tussle---person%1:03:00:: kept Kate---person%1:03:00:: in bed---bed%1:06:00:: a week---week%1:28:00:: until her milk---milk%1:08:00:: dried .
When she returned to life---life%1:09:00:: in the big house---house%1:06:00:: she felt shriveled of all emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: save dedication---dedication%1:07:00:: to duty---duty%1:04:00:: .
She had even steeled herself to keep Juanita---person%1:03:00:: upstairs in the nurse---nurse%1:18:01:: 's room---room%1:06:00:: off the empty nursery---nursery%1:06:01:: , although the girl---girl%1:18:00:: tried to insist on moving back to the quarters---quarters%1:06:00:: to spare Kate---person%1:03:00:: remembrance---remembrance%1:09:00:: of the baby---baby%1:18:00:: 's death---death%1:11:00:: .
Juanita---person%1:03:00:: drooped about the place---place%1:15:06:: , wearing a haunted , brooding look---look%1:07:01:: , which Kate---person%1:03:00:: attributed to the baby---baby%1:18:00:: 's death---death%1:26:00:: , until the day---day%1:28:01:: a letter---letter%1:10:00:: came for her addressed to `` Miss Juanita Fitzroy---person%1:03:00:: '' , bearing a Grafton---location%1:03:00:: postmark---postmark%1:10:00:: .
Seeing the slanting hand---hand%1:10:00:: , Kate---person%1:03:00:: knew uneasily that it was from the Yankee colonel---colonel%1:18:00:: .
The Federal forces---force%1:14:00:: had taken Parkersburg---location%1:03:00:: and Grafton---location%1:03:00:: from the Rebels---rebel%1:18:02:: and were moving to take all the mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: tried to contain her curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: and foreboding---foreboding%1:12:00:: at what the letter---letter%1:10:00:: portended , at what involvement---involvement%1:24:00:: existed for Juanita---person%1:03:00:: .
Uncle Randolph---person%1:03:00:: and Joel---person%1:03:00:: had replanted the bottom lands---bottomland%1:17:00:: with difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: , for more of the slaves---slave%1:18:01:: , including Annie---person%1:03:00:: , had sneaked off when the soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: broke camp .
Joel---person%1:03:00:: worked like a field hand---fieldhand%1:18:00:: in the afternoons---afternoon%1:28:00:: after school---school%1:28:00:: .
He had been at lessons---lesson%1:04:01:: in the schoolhouse---schoolhouse%1:06:00:: since they returned from Harpers Ferry---location%1:03:00:: .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: felt she had deserted the boy---boy%1:18:00:: in her own loss---loss%1:11:01:: .
She loved him and missed his company---company%1:26:00:: .
Uncle Randolph---person%1:03:00:: had been riding out every evening---evening%1:28:00:: on some secret business---business%1:09:00:: of his own .
What it was Kate---person%1:03:00:: could not fathom .
He claimed to be visiting the waterfront---waterfront%1:15:00:: saloon---saloon%1:06:01:: at the crossroads---crossroads%1:14:00:: to play cards---card%1:06:00:: and drink with his cronies---crony%1:18:00:: , but Kate---person%1:03:00:: had not smelled brandy---brandy%1:13:00:: on him since Mrs. Lattimer---person%1:03:00:: 's funeral---funeral%1:11:00:: .
Joel---person%1:03:00:: knew what he was about , however .
`` You 're gonna get caught '' , she heard Joel---person%1:03:00:: say to Uncle Randolph---person%1:03:00:: by the pump---pump%1:06:00:: one morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
`` Not this old fox---fox%1:18:00:: '' , chuckled Uncle Randolph---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Everybody knows I'm just a harmless , deaf old man---old_man%1:18:02:: who takes to drink---drink%1:04:00:: .
I aim to keep a little whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: still back in the ridge---ridge%1:17:00:: for my pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: '' .
`` Whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: still , my foot '' , said Joel---person%1:03:00:: .
`` You 're back there riding with the guerrillas---guerrilla%1:18:00:: , the Moccasin Rangers---group%1:03:00:: '' .
`` Hush '' , said Uncle Randolph---person%1:03:00:: , smiling , `` or I 'll give you another black eye---black_eye%1:26:00:: '' .
He patted the eye---eye%1:08:00:: Joel---person%1:03:00:: had had blackened in a fight---fight%1:04:02:: over being Rebel---rebel%1:18:02:: at the crossroads---crossroads%1:14:00:: some days---day%1:28:00:: back .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: what they were talking of , although she had seen the blue lights---light%1:06:00:: and strange fires---fire%1:22:00:: burning and winking on the ridges---ridge%1:17:00:: at night---night%1:28:00:: , had heard horsemen---horseman%1:18:00:: on the River Road---location%1:03:00:: and hill---hill%1:17:00:: trails---trail%1:06:00:: through the nights---night%1:28:00:: till dawn---dawn%1:28:00:: .
Stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: , Uncle Randolph---person%1:03:00:: began riding home nights---night%1:28:00:: with a jug---jug%1:06:00:: strapped to his saddle---saddle%1:06:00:: , drunkenly singing `` Old Dan Tucker '' at the top---top%1:07:02:: of his voice---voice%1:07:01:: .
Hearing his voice---voice%1:10:00:: ring raucously up from the road---road%1:06:00:: , Kate---person%1:03:00:: would await him anxiously and watch perplexed as he walked into the house---house%1:06:00:: , cold sober .
What he was about became clear to her with the circulation---circulation%1:10:00:: of another broadside---broadside%1:10:00:: proclamation---proclamation%1:10:00:: by General McClellan---person%1:03:00:: , threatening reprisals---reprisal%1:04:00:: against Rebel---rebel%1:18:02:: guerrillas---guerrilla%1:18:00:: .
She was taken up in worry---worry%1:12:00:: for the reckless old man---old_man%1:18:02:: .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: drew more and more on her affection---affection%1:12:00:: for Joel---person%1:03:00:: through the hot days---day%1:28:02:: of summer---summer%1:28:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: .
She had taken him out of the schoolhouse---schoolhouse%1:06:00:: and closed the school---school%1:14:00:: for the summer---summer%1:28:00:: , after she saw Miss Snow---person%1:03:00:: crack Joel---person%1:03:00:: across the face---face%1:08:00:: with a ruler---ruler%1:06:00:: for letting a snake---snake%1:05:00:: loose in the schoolroom---schoolroom%1:06:00:: .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: had walked past the school---school%1:06:00:: on her morning chores---chore%1:04:00:: and had seen the whole incident---incident%1:11:00:: , had seen Joel---person%1:03:00:: 's burning humiliation---humiliation%1:12:00:: before Miss Snow---person%1:03:00:: 's cold , bespectacled wrath---wrath%1:12:00:: .
He had the hardest pains---pains%1:04:00:: of growing before him now , as he approached twelve---twelve%1:23:00:: .
These would be his hardest years---years%1:28:00:: , she knew , and he missed his father---father%1:18:00:: desperately .
She tried to find some way---way%1:04:01:: to draw him out , to help him .
Whenever she found time---time%1:28:05:: , she went blackberry---blackberry%1:13:00:: picking with him , and they would come home---home%1:15:04:: together , mouths---mouth%1:08:01:: purple , arms---arm%1:08:00:: and faces---face%1:08:00:: scratched , tired enough to forget grief---grief%1:12:00:: for another day---day%1:28:02:: .
He tended the new colts---colt%1:05:02:: Beau---person%1:03:00:: had sired .
He helped Kate---person%1:03:00:: and Juanita---person%1:03:00:: enlarge the flower garden---flower_garden%1:06:00:: in the side yard---side_yard%1:06:00:: , where they sometimes sat in the still evenings---evening%1:28:00:: watching the last fat bees---bee%1:05:00:: working against the summer---summer%1:28:00:: 's purple dusk .
No one went much to the crossroads---crossroads%1:14:00:: now except Uncle Randolph---person%1:03:00:: .
They stayed in their own world---world%1:14:01:: on the bluff---bluff%1:17:00:: , waiting for letters---letter%1:10:00:: and the peddler---peddler%1:18:00:: , bringing the news---news%1:10:00:: .
Jonathan---person%1:03:00:: wrote grimly of the destruction---destruction%1:11:00:: of Harpers Ferry---location%1:03:00:: before they abandoned it ; of their first engagement---engagement%1:04:01:: at Falling Waters---location%1:03:00:: after Old Jack---person%1:03:00:: 's First Brigade---group%1:03:00:: had destroyed all the rolling stock---rolling_stock%1:06:00:: of the B + O Railroad---group%1:03:00:: .
The men---men%1:14:00:: were restive , he wrote , ready to take the battle---battle%1:04:00:: to the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: as Jackson---person%1:03:00:: wished .
The peddler---peddler%1:18:00:: came bawling his wares and told them of the convention---convention%1:14:00:: in Wheeling---location%1:03:00:: , Which had formed a new state government---state_government%1:14:00:: by declaring the government---government%1:14:00:: at Richmond---location%1:03:00:: in the east---east%1:24:00:: illegal because they were traitors---traitor%1:18:00:: .
Dangling his gaudy trinkets---trinket%1:06:00:: before them , he told of the Rebel---rebel%1:18:02:: losses---loss%1:11:00:: in the mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: , at Cheat---location%1:03:00:: and Rich---location%1:03:00:: mountains---mountain%1:17:00:: both , and the Federal march---march%1:14:00:: on Beverly---location%1:03:00:: .
They won't never git over inter loyal western Virginia---location%1:03:00:: , them traitors---traitor%1:18:00:: !
The Federals is making everybody take the oath---oath%1:10:00:: of loyalty---loyalty%1:07:00:: around these parts---parts%1:15:00:: too '' , he crowed .
After he had gone , Kate---person%1:03:00:: asked Uncle Randolph---person%1:03:00:: proudly , `` Would you take their oath---oath%1:10:00:: '' ?
And the old man---old_man%1:18:02:: had given a sly and wicked laugh---laugh%1:10:00:: and said , `` Hell , yes---yes%1:10:00:: !
I think I 've taken it about fifty times---time%1:11:00:: already '' ! winking at Joel---person%1:03:00:: 's look---look%1:07:01:: of shock---shock%1:12:01:: .
Her mother---mother%1:18:00:: wrote Kate---person%1:03:00:: of her grief---grief%1:12:00:: at the death---death%1:11:00:: of Kate---person%1:03:00:: 's baby---baby%1:18:00:: and at Jonathan---person%1:03:00:: 's decision---decision%1:04:00:: to go with the South---south%1:15:00:: `` And , dear Kate---person%1:03:00:: '' , she wrote , `` poor Dr. Breckenridge---person%1:03:00:: 's son---son%1:18:00:: Robert---person%1:03:00:: is now organizing a militia---militia%1:14:00:: company---company%1:14:03:: to go South---south%1:15:01:: , to his good father---father%1:18:00:: 's sorrow---sorrow%1:12:00:: .
Maj. Anderson---person%1:03:00:: of Fort Sumter---group%1:03:00:: is home and recruiting volunteers---volunteer%1:18:01:: for the U.S. Army---group%1:03:00:: .
In spite of the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that the state legislature---group%1:03:00:: voted us neutral , John Hunt Morgan---person%1:03:00:: is openly flying the Confederate flag over his woolen---woolen%1:06:00:: factory---factory%1:06:00:: '' !
Rumor---rumor%1:10:00:: of a big battle---battle%1:04:00:: spread like a grassfire---grassfire%1:11:00:: up the valley---valley%1:17:00:: .
Accounts---account%1:10:04:: were garbled at the telegraph---telegraph%1:06:00:: office---office%1:06:00:: when they sent old George---person%1:03:00:: down to Parkersburg---location%1:03:00:: for the news---news%1:10:01:: .
`` All dey know down dere is it were at Manassas Junction---location%1:03:00:: and it were a big fight---fight%1:04:02:: '' , the old man---old_man%1:18:02:: told them .
In the next few days---day%1:28:00:: they had cause---cause%1:10:00:: to rejoice .
It had been a big battle---battle%1:04:00:: , and the Confederate forces---force%1:14:00:: had won .
Jonathan---person%1:03:00:: and Ben---person%1:03:00:: were not on the lists---list%1:10:00:: of the dead---dead%1:14:00:: or on that of the missing .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: and Mrs. Tussle---person%1:03:00:: waited for letters---letter%1:10:00:: anxiously .
Joel---person%1:03:00:: went to the crest---crest%1:15:00:: of a hill---hill%1:17:00:: behind the house---house%1:06:00:: and lit an enormous victory---victory%1:11:00:: bonfire---bonfire%1:11:00:: to celebrate .
When Kate---person%1:03:00:: hurried in alarm---alarm%1:12:00:: to tell him to put it out , she saw other dots---dot%1:25:00:: of flames---flame%1:22:00:: among the western Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: hills from the few scattered fires---fire%1:22:00:: of the faithful---faithful%1:14:01:: .
They all prayed now that the North---north%1:15:01:: would realize that peace---peace%1:26:00:: must come , for Virginia---location%1:03:00:: had defended her land---land%1:15:01:: victoriously .
The week---week%1:28:00:: after Manassas---location%1:03:00:: the sound---sound%1:09:00:: of horses---horse%1:05:00:: in the yard---yard%1:06:02:: brought Kate---person%1:03:00:: up in shock---shock%1:12:01:: from an afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: 's rest---rest%1:28:00:: when she saw the Federal soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: from her upstairs window---window%1:06:00:: .
They had already lost most of their corn---corn%1:13:00:: , she thought .
Were they to be insulted again because of the South---south%1:15:00:: 's great victory---victory%1:11:00:: ?
She remembered McClellan---person%1:03:00:: 's last proclamation---proclamation%1:10:00:: as she hurried fearfully down the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: .
At the landing---landing%1:06:01:: she saw Juanita---person%1:03:00:: , her face---face%1:08:00:: flushed pink---pink%1:07:00:: with excitement---excitement%1:12:00:: , run down the hall---hall%1:06:03:: from the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: to the front door---front_door%1:06:00:: .
Juanita---person%1:03:00:: stopped just inside the open door---door%1:06:00:: , her hand---hand%1:08:00:: to her mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: .
As Kate---person%1:03:00:: came swiftly down the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: to the hall---hall%1:06:05:: she saw Colonel Marsh---person%1:03:00:: framed in the doorway---doorway%1:06:00:: , his face---face%1:08:00:: set in the same vulnerable look---look%1:07:01:: Juanita---person%1:03:00:: wore .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: greeted him gravely , uneasy with misgivings---misgiving%1:12:00:: at his visit---visit%1:14:00:: .
`` What brings you here again , Colonel Marsh---person%1:03:00:: '' ? she asked , taking him and Juanita---person%1:03:00:: into the parlor---parlor%1:06:00:: where the shutters---shutter%1:06:00:: were closed against the afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: sun---sun%1:17:00:: .
`` I stopped to say goodbye , Mrs. Lattimer---person%1:03:00:: , and to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your baby---baby%1:18:00:: .
I wish our doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: could have saved her '' .
`` It was a terrible loss---loss%1:11:01:: to me '' , said Kate---person%1:03:00:: quietly , feeling the pain---pain%1:12:00:: twist again at the mention---mention%1:10:01:: , knowing now that Juanita---person%1:03:00:: must have written to him at Grafton---location%1:03:00:: .
`` Where will you go now that you 're leaving Parkersburg---location%1:03:00:: '' ?
she asked him , seeing Juanita---person%1:03:00:: 's eyes---eye%1:08:00:: grow bleak .
`` As you know , General McClellan---person%1:03:00:: has been occupying Beverly---location%1:03:00:: .
He has notified me that he has orders---order%1:10:03:: to go to Washington---location%1:03:00:: to take over the Army of the Potomac---group%1:03:00:: .
I am to go to Washington---location%1:03:00:: to serve with him '' .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: asked , watching them both now anxiously .
Their eyes---eye%1:08:00:: betrayed too much of their emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: , she thought sadly .
`` Tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:00:: .
Would you permit Juanita---person%1:03:00:: to walk about the grounds---grounds%1:06:00:: with me for a short spell---spell%1:28:00:: , Mrs. Lattimer---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` Stay here in the parlor---parlor%1:06:00:: where it 's cool '' , she said , trying to be calm .
It would be better for Joel---person%1:03:00:: and Uncle Randolph---person%1:03:00:: and Mrs. Tussle---person%1:03:00:: not to see them .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: went back and reminded the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: women---woman%1:18:00:: of the supper---supper%1:13:00:: preparations---preparation%1:04:02:: .
Then she took iced lemonade---lemonade%1:13:00:: to Marsh---person%1:03:00:: 's young aide---aide%1:18:01:: where he sat in the cool of the big trees---tree%1:20:00:: around the flower garden---flower_garden%1:06:00:: .
When Marsh---person%1:03:00:: called to his aide---aide%1:18:01:: and the pair---pair%1:14:00:: rode off down the River Road---location%1:03:00:: where the gentians---gentian%1:20:00:: burned blue , Juanita---person%1:03:00:: was shaken and trying not to cry .
She sought Kate---person%1:03:00:: out upstairs , her lips---lip%1:08:00:: trembling .
`` He wants me to go with him tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:00:: '' , she told Kate---person%1:03:00:: .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: asked , uneasy at the gravity---gravity%1:07:00:: of the girl---girl%1:18:00:: 's dilemma---dilemma%1:09:00:: .
He knows me as your niece---niece%1:18:00:: , which , of course , I am .
But I am a slave---slave%1:18:00:: !
It 's your decision---decision%1:04:00:: '' , said Juanita---person%1:03:00:: , holding her face---face%1:08:00:: very still , trying to contain the bitterness---bitterness%1:07:01:: of her voice---voice%1:07:00:: as she enunciated her words---word%1:10:00:: too distinctly .
`` No---no%1:10:00:: , the decision---decision%1:04:00:: is yours .
I have held your papers---papers%1:10:00:: of manumission---manumission%1:04:00:: since I married Mr. Lattimer---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Going downstairs with the tray---tray%1:06:00:: , Winston---person%1:03:00:: wished he could have given in to Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: , but he knew better than to do what she said when she had that little girl---girl%1:18:02:: look---look%1:07:01:: .
There were times---time%1:11:00:: it was n't right to make a person---person%1:03:00:: happy , like the times---time%1:11:00:: she came in the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: and asked for a peanut butter---peanut_butter%1:13:00:: sandwich---sandwich%1:13:00:: .
`` You know we do n't keep peanut butter---peanut_butter%1:13:00:: in this house---house%1:06:00:: '' , he always told her .
`` Why , Winston---person%1:03:00:: '' , she 'd cry , `` I just now saw you eating it out of the jar---jar%1:06:00:: '' !
But he knew how important it was for her to keep her figure---figure%1:07:00:: .
In the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: , Leona---person%1:03:00:: , his little young wife---wife%1:18:00:: , was reading the morning---morning%1:28:00:: paper---paper%1:10:03:: .
Her legs---leg%1:08:01:: hung down long and thin as she sat on the high stool---stool%1:06:00:: .
`` Here '' , Winston---person%1:03:00:: said gently , `` what 's these dishes---dish%1:06:00:: doing not washed '' ?
The enormous plates---plate%1:06:00:: which had held Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: 's four fried eggs---fried_egg%1:13:00:: and five strips---strip%1:17:00:: of bacon---bacon%1:13:00:: were still stacked in the sink---sink%1:06:00:: .
`` Leave me alone '' , Leona---person%1:03:00:: said .
She looked at him impudently over the corner---corner%1:15:01:: of the paper---paper%1:27:00:: .
`` This is moving day---day%1:28:01:: '' , Winston---person%1:03:00:: reminded her , `` and I bet you left things---thing%1:06:00:: every which way upstairs , your clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: all over the floor---floor%1:06:00:: and the bed---bed%1:06:00:: not made .
Leona---person%1:03:00:: '' !
His eye---eye%1:08:00:: had fastened on her leg---leg%1:08:01:: ; bending , he touched her knee---knee%1:05:01:: .
`` If I catch you one more time---time%1:11:00:: down here without stockings---stocking%1:06:00:: '' -
She twitched her leg---leg%1:08:01:: away .
`` Fuss , fuss , old man---old_man%1:18:02:: '' .
She had an alley cat---alley_cat%1:05:00:: 's manners---manners%1:07:00:: .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: stacked Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: 's thin pink dishes---dish%1:06:00:: in the sink---sink%1:06:00:: .
Then he spread out the last list---list%1:10:00:: on the counter---counter%1:06:00:: .
`` To Be Left Behind '' was printed at the top---top%1:15:01:: in Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: ; fine hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: took out a pencil---pencil%1:06:00:: , admired the point---point%1:06:00:: , and wrote slowly and heavily , `` Clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: Stand---stand%1:06:03:: '' .
Sighing , Leona---person%1:03:00:: dropped the paper---paper%1:27:00:: and stood up .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: watched her fumbling to untie her apron---apron%1:06:00:: .
Carefully , he undid the bow---bow%1:06:03:: .
`` How come your bows---bow%1:06:03:: is always cockeyed '' ?
She turned and put her arms---arm%1:08:00:: around his neck---neck%1:08:00:: .
`` I do n't want to leave here , Winston---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` I thought you was sick to death of this big house---house%1:06:00:: .
Said you wore yourself out , cleaning all these empty rooms---room%1:06:00:: '' .
`` At least there is room---room%1:23:00:: here '' , she said .
`` What room---room%1:23:00:: is there going to be in an apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: for any child---child%1:18:01:: '' ?
`` I told you what Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: 's doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: said '' .
`` I do n't mean Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: !
I mean our children---child%1:18:01:: '' .
In spite of the hundred things---thing%1:09:02:: he had on his mind---mind%1:09:00:: , Winston---person%1:03:00:: went and put his arm---arm%1:08:00:: around her waist---waist%1:08:00:: .
`` We 've got plenty---plenty%1:07:00:: of time---time%1:28:05:: to think about that .
All the time---time%1:28:05:: in the world .
We 've only been married four years---year%1:28:01:: , January---january%1:28:00:: '' .
`` Four years---year%1:28:01:: '' ! she wailed .
`` That 's a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: , waiting '' .
`` How many times---time%1:11:00:: have I told you '' - he began , and was almost glad when she cut him off - `` Too many times---time%1:11:00:: '' !
- and flounced to the sink---sink%1:06:00:: , where she began noisily to wash her hands---hand%1:08:00:: .
Too many times---time%1:11:00:: was the truth---truth%1:09:00:: of it , Winston---person%1:03:00:: thought .
He hardly believed his reason---reason%1:16:00:: himself any more .
Although it had seemed a good reason---reason%1:16:00:: , to begin with : no couple---couple%1:14:01:: could afford to have children---child%1:18:01:: .
`` How you going to work with a child---child%1:18:00:: hanging on you '' ?
he asked Leona---person%1:03:00:: .
`` You want to keep this job---job%1:04:00:: , do n't you '' ?
He doubted whether she heard him , over the running water---water%1:27:00:: .
He sat for a while with his hands---hand%1:08:00:: on his knees---knee%1:05:01:: , watching the bend---bend%1:11:00:: of her back---back%1:08:00:: as she gathered up her things---thing%1:06:00:: - a comb---comb%1:06:00:: , a bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: of aspirin---aspirin%1:06:00:: - to take upstairs and pack .
She made him sad some days---day%1:28:03:: , and he was never sure why ; it was something to do with her back---back%1:08:00:: , the thinness---thinness%1:07:00:: of it , and the quick , jerky way---way%1:07:01:: she bent .
`` Winston---person%1:03:00:: '' !
It was Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: , bellowing out in the hall---hall%1:06:05:: .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: hurried through the swinging door---swinging_door%1:06:00:: .
`` I 've been bursting my lungs---lung%1:08:00:: for you '' , Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: complained .
He was standing in front of the mirror---mirror%1:06:00:: , tightening his tie---tie%1:06:01:: .
He had on his gray tweed---tweed%1:06:00:: overcoat---overcoat%1:06:00:: and his city---city%1:15:00:: hat---hat%1:06:00:: , and his brief case---briefcase%1:06:00:: lay on the bench---bench%1:06:00:: .
`` I do n't know what you think you 've been doing about my clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: '' , he said .
`` This coat---coat%1:06:00:: looks like a rag---rag%1:06:00:: heap---heap%1:14:00:: '' .
There were a few blades---blade%1:17:00:: of lint---lint%1:27:02:: on the shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: took the clothesbrush---clothesbrush%1:06:00:: out of the closet---closet%1:06:03:: and went to work .
He gave Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: a real going over---going-over%1:04:00:: ; he brushed his shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: and his back---back%1:08:00:: and his collar---collar%1:06:00:: with long , firm strokes---stroke%1:04:01:: .
Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: cried when the brush---brush%1:06:00:: tipped his hat---hat%1:06:00:: down over his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: apologized and quickly set the hat---hat%1:06:00:: right .
Then he stood back to look at Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: , who was pulling on his pigskin---pigskin%1:27:00:: gloves .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: enjoyed seeing him start out ; he wore his clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: with style---style%1:07:00:: .
When he was going to town---town%1:15:00:: , nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: was good enough - he had cursed at Winston---person%1:03:00:: once for leaving a fleck---fleck%1:17:00:: of polish---polish%1:07:00:: on his shoelace---shoelace%1:06:00:: .
At home---home%1:15:04:: , he would n't even wash his hands---hand%1:08:00:: for supper---supper%1:13:00:: , and he wandered around the yard---yard%1:06:02:: in a pair---pair%1:14:01:: of sweaty old corduroys---corduroys%1:06:04:: .
The velvet---velvet%1:06:00:: smoking jackets---smoking_jacket%1:06:00:: , pearl---pearl%1:07:00:: gray , wine---wine%1:07:00:: , and blue---blue%1:07:00:: , which Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: had bought him hung brushed and unworn in the closet---closet%1:06:03:: .
`` Good-by , Winston---person%1:03:00:: '' , Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: said , giving a final set---set%1:04:01:: to his hat---hat%1:06:00:: .
`` Look out for those movers---mover%1:18:02:: '' !
Winston---person%1:03:00:: watched him hurry down the drive---drive%1:06:01:: to his car---car%1:06:00:: ; a handsome , fine-looking man---man%1:18:00:: it made him proud to see .
After Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: drove away , Winston---person%1:03:00:: went on looking out the window---window%1:06:00:: .
He noticed a speck---speck%1:27:00:: of dirt---dirt%1:26:00:: on the sill---sill%1:06:00:: and swiped at it with his finger---finger%1:08:00:: .
Then he looked at his finger---finger%1:08:00:: , at the wrinkled , heavy knuckle---knuckle%1:08:00:: and the thick nail---nail%1:08:00:: he used like a knife---knife%1:06:00:: to pry up , slit , and open .
For the first time , he let himself be sad about the move---move%1:04:01:: .
That house---house%1:06:00:: was ten years---year%1:28:01:: off his life---life%1:28:01:: .
Each brass---brass%1:27:00:: handle---handle%1:06:00:: and hinge---hinge%1:06:00:: shone for his reward---reward%1:21:00:: , and he knew how to get at the dust---dust%1:27:00:: in the china---china%1:06:00:: flowers---flower%1:20:00:: and how to take down the long glass---glass%1:27:00:: drops---drop%1:25:00:: which hung from the chandelier---chandelier%1:06:00:: .
He knew the house---house%1:06:00:: like a blind man , through his fingers---finger%1:08:00:: , and he did not like to think of all the time---time%1:28:05:: and rags---rag%1:06:00:: and polishes---polish%1:07:00:: he had spent on keeping it up .
Ten years---year%1:28:01:: ago , he had come to the house---house%1:06:00:: to be interviewed .
The tulips---tulip%1:20:00:: and the big pink peonies---peony%1:20:00:: had been blooming along the drive---drive%1:06:01:: , and he had walked up from the bus---bus%1:06:00:: almost singing .
Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: had been out back , in a straw hat---straw_hat%1:06:00:: , planting flowers---flower%1:20:00:: .
She had talked to him right there , with the hot sun---sun%1:17:00:: in his face---face%1:08:00:: , which made him sweat and feel ashamed .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: had been surprised at her for that .
Still , he had liked the way---way%1:07:01:: she had looked , in a fresh , neat cotton---cotton%1:27:01:: dress---dress%1:06:00:: - citron---citron%1:13:00:: yellow---yellow%1:07:00:: , if he remembered .
She had had a dignity---dignity%1:07:01:: about her , even barefoot and almost too tan---tan%1:26:00:: .
Since then , the flowers---flower%1:20:00:: she had planted had spread all over the hill---hill%1:17:00:: .
Already the jonquils---jonquil%1:20:00:: were blooming in a flock---flock%1:14:03:: by the front gate---gate%1:06:00:: , and the periwinkles---periwinkle%1:20:01:: were coming on , blue---blue%1:07:00:: by the porch---porch%1:06:00:: steps---steps%1:06:00:: .
In a week---week%1:28:00:: the hyacinths---hyacinth%1:27:00:: would spike out .
And the dogwood---dogwood%1:20:00:: in early May---may%1:28:00:: , for Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: 's alfresco party---party%1:14:00:: ; and after that the Japanese cherries---japanese_cherry%1:20:00:: .
Now the yard---yard%1:06:02:: looked wet and bald , the trees---tree%1:20:00:: bare under their buds---bud%1:20:00:: , but in a while---while%1:28:00:: Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: 's flowers---flower%1:20:00:: would bloom like a marching parade---parade%1:14:00:: .
She had dug a hole---hole%1:17:01:: for each bulb---bulb%1:20:00:: , each tree---tree%1:20:00:: wore a tag---tag%1:10:00:: with her writing---writing%1:10:01:: on it ; where would she go for her gardening---gardening%1:04:00:: now ?
Somehow Winston---person%1:03:00:: did n't think she 'd take to window boxes---window_box%1:06:00:: .
Sighing , he hurried to the living room---living_room%1:06:00:: .
He had a thousand things---thing%1:09:02:: to see to .
Still , he could n't help thinking , we 're all getting old , getting small ; the snail---snail%1:05:00:: is pulling in her horns---horn%1:05:01:: .
In the living room---living_room%1:06:00:: , Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: was standing by the window---window%1:06:00:: with a sheaf---sheaf%1:06:00:: of lists---list%1:10:00:: in her hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
She was looking out at the garden---garden%1:06:01:: .
`` Winston---person%1:03:00:: '' , she said , `` get the basket---basket%1:06:00:: for the breakables---breakable%1:06:00:: '' .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: had the big straw---straw%1:27:00:: basket---basket%1:06:00:: ready---ready%1:26:00:: in the hall---hall%1:06:05:: .
Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: was looking fine ; she had on her Easter---easter%1:28:00:: suit---suit%1:06:00:: , blue---blue%1:07:00:: , with lavender binding---binding%1:06:01:: .
Halfway across the house---house%1:06:00:: , he could have smelled her morning---morning%1:28:00:: perfume---perfume%1:09:00:: .
It hung in all her day---day%1:28:02:: clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: , sweet and strong ; sometimes when he was pressing , Winston---person%1:03:00:: raised her dresses---dress%1:06:00:: to his face---face%1:08:00:: .
Frowning , Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: studied the list---list%1:10:00:: .
The china---china%1:06:00:: lemon tree---lemon_tree%1:20:00:: .
The alabaster---alabaster%1:27:00:: cockatoo---cockatoo%1:05:00:: '' .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: followed her around the room---room%1:06:00:: , collecting the small frail objects---object%1:03:00:: ( Christmas---christmas%1:28:01:: , birthday---birthday%1:28:00:: , and anniversary---anniversary%1:28:00:: ) and wrapping them in tissue paper---tissue_paper%1:27:00:: .
Neither of them trusted the movers---mover%1:18:02:: .
When they came to Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: 's photograph---photograph%1:06:00:: , twenty by twelve inches---inch%1:23:00:: in a curly silver frame---frame%1:06:02:: , Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: said , `` By rights I ought to leave that , seeing he won n't take my clotheshorse---clotheshorse%1:06:00:: '' .
She smiled at Winston---person%1:03:00:: , and he saw the hateful hard glitter---glitter%1:07:00:: in her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
He picked up the photograph---photograph%1:06:00:: and began to wrap it .
`` At least you could leave it for the movers---mover%1:18:02:: '' , Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` What possessed you to tell me a clotheshorse---clotheshorse%1:06:00:: would be a good idea---idea%1:09:00:: '' ?
Winston---person%1:03:00:: folded the tissue paper---tissue_paper%1:27:00:: carefully .
`` He 's used it every day ; every morning---morning%1:28:00:: , I lay out his clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: on it '' .
And it was his main present---present%1:21:00:: !
Leave that fool picture---picture%1:06:00:: out '' , she added sharply .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: laid it in the basket---basket%1:06:00:: .
`` Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: sets store---store%1:06:00:: by that '' .
`` Really , Winston---person%1:03:00:: .
It was meant to be my present---present%1:21:00:: '' .
But she went on down the list---list%1:10:00:: .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: was relieved ; those presents---present%1:21:00:: had been on his mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
He had only agreed with Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: about getting the valet---valet%1:18:00:: , but he had actually suggested the photograph---photograph%1:06:00:: to Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: .
`` You know what she likes , Winston---person%1:03:00:: '' , he had said wearily , one evening---evening%1:28:00:: in November---november%1:28:00:: when Winston---person%1:03:00:: was pulling off his overshoes---overshoe%1:06:00:: .
`` Tell me what to get her for Christmas---christmas%1:28:00:: '' .
`` She 's been talking about a picture---picture%1:06:00:: '' , Winston---person%1:03:00:: had told him .
`` Picture---picture%1:06:00:: !
You mean picture---picture%1:06:00:: of me '' ?
But Winston---person%1:03:00:: had persuaded him .
On Christmas---christmas%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: , they had had a disagreement---disagreement%1:26:00:: about it .
Winston---person%1:03:00:: had heard because he was setting up the liquor---liquor%1:13:00:: tray---tray%1:06:00:: in the next room---room%1:06:00:: .
Through the door---door%1:06:01:: , he had seen Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: walking around , waiting for Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: .
Finally she had come down ; Winston---person%1:03:00:: had heard her shaking out the skirt---skirt%1:06:01:: of her new pink silk---silk%1:06:00:: hostess---hostess%1:18:01:: gown---gown%1:06:00:: .
Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: had said , `` You look about fifteen years---year%1:28:01:: old '' .
`` Is that a compliment---compliment%1:10:00:: '' ?
He had stood at a little distance---distance%1:07:00:: , studying her , as though he would walk around next and look at the back---back%1:06:00:: of her head---head%1:08:00:: .
Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: had giggled , and she went sweeping and rustling to the couch---couch%1:06:00:: and sank down .
`` You look like that picture---picture%1:06:00:: I have at the office---office%1:06:00:: '' , Mr. Jack---person%1:03:00:: had started .
`` Not a line---line%1:25:01:: , not a wrinkle---wrinkle%1:25:00:: .
I look like an old man---old_man%1:18:02:: , compared '' , and he had picked up his photograph---photograph%1:06:00:: with the red Christmas---christmas%1:28:01:: bow---bow%1:06:03:: still on it .
`` Look , an old man---old_man%1:18:02:: .
`` Darling---darling%1:18:00:: , I love that photograph---photograph%1:06:00:: .
I'm going to put it on my dresser---dresser%1:06:00:: '' .
`` I guess it 's children---child%1:18:01:: make a woman---woman%1:18:00:: old .
A man---man%1:18:00:: gets old anyhow '' .
After a minute---minute%1:28:00:: he went on , `` People---people%1:14:00:: must think the curse---curse%1:10:02:: is on me , seeing you fresh as an apple---apple%1:13:00:: and me old and gray '' .
`` I 'll give you a medical certificate---certificate%1:10:00:: , framed , if you like '' , Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: had said .
All I want is a picture---picture%1:06:00:: - with a few lines---line%1:10:02:: .
Make the man---man%1:18:00:: put them in if he has to '' .
After that they had sat for five minutes---minute%1:28:00:: without saying a word---word%1:10:00:: .
Then Miss Ada---person%1:03:00:: had stood up , rustling and rustling , and gone upstairs .
She was a child---child%1:18:00:: too much a part---part%1:24:00:: of her environment---environment%1:26:00:: , too eager to grow and learn and experience .
Once , they were at Easthampton---location%1:03:00:: for the summer---summer%1:28:00:: ( again , Fritzie---person%1:03:00:: said , a good place---place%1:15:00:: , even though they were being robbed ) .
One soft evening---evening%1:28:00:: - that marvelous sea---sea%1:17:00:: blessed time---time%1:11:00:: when the sun---sun%1:17:00:: 's departing warmth---warmth%1:09:00:: lingers and a smell---smell%1:07:00:: of spume---spume%1:17:00:: and wrack---wrack%1:05:01:: haunts everything - Amy---person%1:03:00:: had picked herself off the floor---floor%1:06:00:: and begun to walk .
Fritzie---person%1:03:00:: was on the couch---couch%1:06:00:: reading ; Laura---person%1:03:00:: was sitting in an easy chair---easy_chair%1:06:00:: about eight feet---foot%1:23:00:: away .
The infant---infant%1:18:00:: , in white terry-cloth---terrycloth%1:06:00:: bathrobe---bathrobe%1:06:00:: , her face---face%1:08:00:: intense and purposeful , had essayed a few wobbly steps---step%1:23:00:: toward her father---father%1:18:00:: .
Then , gently , he shoved her behind toward Laura---person%1:03:00:: .
Amy---person%1:03:00:: walked - making it halfway across the cottage---cottage%1:06:00:: floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
She lost not a second---second%1:28:00:: , picking herself up and continuing her pilgrimage---pilgrimage%1:04:00:: to Laura---person%1:03:00:: .
Then Laura---person%1:03:00:: took her gently and shoved her off again , toward Fritzie---person%1:03:00:: :
Amy---person%1:03:00:: did not laugh - this was work---work%1:04:00:: , concentration---concentration%1:09:00:: , achievement---achievement%1:04:00:: .
In a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: she was making the ten foot---foot%1:23:00:: hike---hike%1:04:00:: unaided ; soon she was parading around the house---house%1:06:00:: , flaunting her new skill---skill%1:09:01:: .
Some liar---liar%1:18:00:: 's logic---logic%1:09:02:: , a wisp---wisp%1:14:01:: of optimism---optimism%1:12:00:: as fragile as the scent---scent%1:09:01:: of tropical blossoms---blossom%1:20:00:: that came through the window---window%1:06:00:: ( a euphoria---euphoria%1:12:00:: perhaps engendered by the pill---pill%1:06:00:: Fritzie---person%1:03:00:: had given her ) , consoled her for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: .
Amy---person%1:03:00:: had to be safe , had to come back to them - if only to reap that share---share%1:21:00:: of life---life%1:28:01:: 's experiences---experience%1:09:01:: that were her due---due%1:07:00:: , if only to give her parents---parent%1:18:00:: another chance---chance%1:26:00:: to do better by her .
Through the swathings---swathing%1:06:00:: of terror---terror%1:12:00:: , she jabbed deceit---deceit%1:07:00:: 's sharp point---point%1:25:00:: - Amy---person%1:03:00:: would be reborn , a new child---child%1:18:00:: , with new parents---parent%1:18:00:: , living under new circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: .
The comfort---comfort%1:12:00:: was short-lived , yet she found herself returning to the assurance---assurance%1:09:00:: whenever her imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: forced images---image%1:09:00:: on her too awful to contemplate without the prop---prop%1:06:00:: of illusion---illusion%1:09:00:: .
Gazing at her husband---husband%1:18:00:: 's drugged body---body%1:08:00:: , his chest---chest%1:08:00:: rising and falling in mindless rhythms---rhythm%1:28:00:: , she saw the grandeur---grandeur%1:07:01:: of his fictional world---world%1:09:00:: , that lush garden---garden%1:14:00:: from which he plucked flowers---flower%1:20:00:: and herbs---herb%1:20:00:: .
In the darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: , she saw him stirring .
He seemed to be muttering , his voice---voice%1:10:00:: surprisingly clear .
`` Y'all should have let me take that money---money%1:21:00:: out '' , Andrus---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` ' Nother minute---minute%1:28:00:: I 'd have been fine .
Laura---person%1:03:00:: touched his hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
`` Yes , I know , Fritzie---person%1:03:00:: .
The heat---heat%1:07:01:: intensified on Tuesday---tuesday%1:28:00:: .
Southern California---location%1:03:00:: gasped and blinked under an autumn hot spell , drier , more enervating , more laden with man 's contrived impurities---impurity%1:26:00:: than the worst days---day%1:28:01:: of the summer---summer%1:28:00:: past .
It could continue this way---way%1:07:01:: , hitting 106 and more in the Valley---location%1:03:00:: , Joe McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: knew , into October---october%1:28:00:: .
He and Irvin Moll---person%1:03:00:: were sipping coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: at the breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: bar---bar%1:06:05:: .
Both had been up since 7 : 00 - Irv---person%1:03:00:: on the early morning watch---watch%1:28:00:: , McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: unable to sleep during his four hour---hour%1:28:00:: relief---relief%1:28:00:: .
The night---night%1:28:00:: before , they had telephoned the Andrus maid---person%1:03:00:: , Selena Masters---person%1:03:00:: , and she had arrived early , bursting her vigorous presence---presence%1:07:00:: into the silent house---house%1:06:00:: with an assurance---assurance%1:09:00:: that amused McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: and confounded Moll---person%1:03:00:: .
The latter , thanking her for the coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: , had winked and muttered , `` Sure ' nuff , honey---honey%1:18:00:: '' .
Selena---person%1:03:00:: was the wrong woman---woman%1:18:00:: for these crudities---crudity%1:07:00:: .
With a hard eye---eye%1:08:00:: , she informed Moll---person%1:03:00:: : `` Do n't sure ' nuff me , officer---officer%1:18:01:: .
I'm honey---honey%1:18:00:: only to my husband---husband%1:18:00:: , understand '' ?
Sergeant Moll---person%1:03:00:: understood .
The maid---maid%1:18:01:: was very black and very energetic , trim in a yellow pique---pique%1:06:00:: uniform---uniform%1:06:00:: .
Her speech---speech%1:10:05:: was barren of southernisms---southernism%1:10:00:: ; she was one of Eliot Sparling---person%1:03:00:: 's neutralized minorities---minority%1:14:00:: , adopting the rolling R 's and constricted vowels---vowel%1:10:00:: of Los Angeles---location%1:03:00:: .
Not seeing her dark intelligent face---face%1:08:00:: , one would have gauged the voice---voice%1:07:00:: as that of a Westwood Village---location%1:03:00:: matron---matron%1:18:00:: , ten years---year%1:28:01:: out of Iowa---location%1:03:00:: .
After she had served the detectives---detective%1:18:00:: coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: and toast---toast%1:13:00:: ( they politely declined eggs---eggs%1:13:00:: , uncomfortable about their tenancy---tenancy%1:04:00:: ) , she settled down with a morning newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: and began reading the stock market---stock_market%1:06:00:: quotations---quotation%1:10:01:: .
While she was thus engaged , McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: questioned her about her whereabouts---whereabouts%1:15:00:: the previous day---day%1:28:00:: , any recollections---recollection%1:09:01:: she had of people---people%1:14:00:: hanging around , of overcurious delivery boys---delivery_boy%1:18:00:: or repairmen---repairman%1:18:00:: , of strange cars---car%1:06:00:: cruising the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: .
She answered him precisely , missing not a beat---beat%1:11:00:: in her scrutiny---scrutiny%1:04:01:: of the financial reports---report%1:10:00:: .
Selena Masters---person%1:03:00:: , Joe---person%1:03:00:: realized , was her own woman---woman%1:18:00:: .
She was the only kind---kind%1:09:00:: of Negro---negro%1:18:00:: Laura Andrus---person%1:03:00:: would want around : independent , unservile , probably charging double what ordinary maids---maid%1:18:01:: did for housework---housework%1:04:00:: - and doubly efficient .
When the parents---parent%1:18:00:: emerged from the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: later , the maid---maid%1:18:01:: greeted them quietly .
`` I'm awful sorry about what 's happened '' , Selena---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Maybe today---today%1:28:01:: 'll be a good news---news%1:10:00:: day---day%1:28:01:: '' .
She charged off to the bedrooms---bedroom%1:06:00:: .
Moll---person%1:03:00:: took his coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: into the nursery---nursery%1:06:01:: .
During the night---night%1:28:00:: , a phone company---phone_company%1:14:00:: technician---technician%1:18:00:: had deadened the bells---bell%1:06:00:: and installed red blinkers---blinker%1:06:00:: on the phones---phone%1:06:00:: .
Someone---someone%1:03:00:: would have to remain in the office---office%1:06:00:: continually .
McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: greeted the parents---parent%1:18:00:: , then studied his notebook---notebook%1:10:00:: .
He wanted to take the mother---mother%1:18:00:: to headquarters---headquarters%1:06:01:: at once and start her on the mug file---mug_file%1:10:00:: .
Andrus---person%1:03:00:: did not answer him .
His face---face%1:08:00:: was bloated with drugging---drugging%1:04:00:: , redder than normal .
The woman---woman%1:18:00:: had the glassy look---look%1:07:00:: of an invalid---invalid%1:18:00:: , as if she had not slept at all .
Did anything happen during the night---night%1:28:00:: '' ?
`` Few crank calls---crank_call%1:10:00:: '' , McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` A couple of tips---tip%1:10:00:: we 're running down - nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: promising .
Too bad your number---number%1:10:03:: is in the directory---directory%1:10:00:: '' .
`` Did n't occur to me my child---child%1:18:01:: would be kidnaped when I had it listed '' , Andrus---person%1:03:00:: muttered .
He settled on the sofa---sofa%1:06:00:: with his coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: , warming his hands---hand%1:08:00:: on the cup---cup%1:06:00:: , although the room---room%1:06:00:: was heavy with heat---heat%1:07:01:: .
The three---three%1:23:00:: had little---little%1:23:00:: to say to each other .
The previous night---night%1:28:00:: 's horror---horror%1:12:01:: - the absolute failure---failure%1:26:00:: , overcast with the intrusions---intrusion%1:04:02:: of the press , had left them all with a wan sense---sense%1:09:05:: of uselessness---uselessness%1:07:00:: , of play-acting---playacting%1:04:00:: .
Sipping their coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: , discussing the weather---weather%1:19:00:: , the day---day%1:28:00:: 's shopping---shopping%1:04:00:: , Fritzie---person%1:03:00:: 's commitments---commitment%1:04:02:: at the network---network%1:06:01:: ( all of which he would cancel ) , they avoided the radio---radio%1:06:01:: , the morning TV---tv%1:10:00:: news show---news_show%1:10:00:: , even the front page---page%1:10:00:: of the Santa Luisa Register , resting on the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: bar---bar%1:06:05:: .
Kidnapper---kidnapper%1:18:00:: Spurns Ransom---ransom%1:04:01:: ; Amy---person%1:03:00:: Still Missing .
Once , Andrus---person%1:03:00:: walked by it , hastily scanned the bold black headline---headline%1:10:00:: and the five column---column%1:10:00:: lead---lead%1:10:01:: of the article---article%1:10:00:: ( by Duane Bosch---person%1:03:00:: , staff---staff%1:14:01:: correspondent---correspondent%1:18:01:: - age---age%1:07:00:: not given ) , and muttered : `` We a buncha---bunch%1:14:02:: national celebrities---celebrity%1:18:00:: '' .
McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: told the parents---parent%1:18:00:: he would escort them to police headquarters---police_headquarters%1:06:00:: in a half hour---hour%1:28:00:: .
Before that , he wanted to talk to the neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: .
He did not want to bring the Andruses---person%1:03:00:: to the station house---station_house%1:06:00:: too early - Rheinholdt---person%1:03:00:: had summoned a press conference---press_conference%1:10:00:: , and he did n't want them subjected to the reporters---reporter%1:18:00:: again .
He could think of nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: else to tell them : no assurances---assurance%1:10:00:: , no hopeful hints---hint%1:10:01:: at great discoveries---discovery%1:09:00:: that day---day%1:28:00:: .
When the detective---detective%1:18:00:: left , Andrus---person%1:03:00:: phoned his secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: to cancel his work---work%1:04:00:: and to advise the network---network%1:06:01:: to get a substitute director---director%1:18:02:: for his current project---project%1:04:00:: .
Mrs. Andrus---person%1:03:00:: was talking to the maid---maid%1:18:01:: , arranging for her to come in every day , instead of the four days---day%1:28:00:: she now worked .
Outside , only a handful---handful%1:23:01:: of reporters---reporter%1:18:00:: remained .
The bulk---bulk%1:07:02:: of the press corps---press_corps%1:14:00:: was covering Rheinholdt---person%1:03:00:: 's conference---conference%1:14:00:: .
In contrast to the caravan---caravan%1:14:00:: of the previous night---night%1:28:00:: , there were only four cars---car%1:06:00:: parked across the street---street%1:06:00:: .
Two men---man%1:18:00:: he did not recognize were sipping coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: and munching sweet rolls---sweet_roll%1:13:00:: .
He did not see Sparling---person%1:03:00:: , or DeGroot---person%1:03:00:: , or Ringel---person%1:03:00:: , or any of the feverish crew---crew%1:14:00:: that had so harassed him twelve hours---hour%1:28:00:: ago .
However , the litter---litter%1:27:00:: remained , augmented by several dozen lunchroom---lunchroom%1:06:00:: suppers---supper%1:13:00:: .
The street cleaner---street_cleaner%1:18:00:: had not yet been around .
One of the reporters---reporter%1:18:00:: called to him : `` Anything new , Lieutenant---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
And he ignored him , skirting the parked cars---car%1:06:00:: and walking up the path---path%1:06:00:: to the Skopas---person%1:03:00:: house---house%1:06:00:: .
When McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: was halfway to the door---door%1:06:01:: , the proprietor---proprietor%1:18:00:: emerged - a mountainous , dark man---man%1:18:00:: , his head---head%1:08:00:: thick with resiny black hair---hair%1:08:00:: , his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: like two---two%1:23:00:: of the black olives---black_olive%1:13:00:: he imported in boatloads---boatload%1:23:00:: .
McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: identified himself .
The master---master%1:18:04:: of the house---house%1:06:00:: , his nourished face---face%1:08:00:: unrevealing , consented to postpone his departure---departure%1:04:00:: a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: to talk to the detective---detective%1:18:00:: .
Inside , as soon as Mr. Skopas---person%1:03:00:: had disclosed - in a hoarse whisper---whisper%1:10:00:: - the detective---detective%1:18:00:: 's errand---errand%1:04:00:: , his family---family%1:14:02:: gathered in a huddle---huddle%1:10:00:: , forming a mass---mass%1:17:00:: of dark flesh---flesh%1:08:01:: on and around a brocaded sofa---sofa%1:06:00:: which stood at one side---side%1:15:02:: of a baroque fireplace---fireplace%1:06:01:: .
Flanked by marble---marble%1:27:00:: urns---urn%1:06:00:: and alabaster---alabaster%1:27:00:: lamps---lamp%1:06:01:: , they seemed to be posing for a tribal portrait .
It was amazing how they had herded together for protection---protection%1:21:00:: : an enormous matriarch---matriarch%1:18:00:: in a quilted silk---silk%1:06:00:: wrapper---wrapper%1:06:01:: , rising from the breakfast table---breakfast_table%1:06:00:: ; a gross boy---boy%1:18:00:: in his teens---teens%1:28:00:: , shuffling in from the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: with a sandwich---sandwich%1:13:00:: in his hands---hand%1:08:00:: ; a girl---girl%1:18:00:: in her twenties---twenties%1:28:00:: , fat and sullen , descending the marble---marble%1:27:00:: staircase---staircase%1:06:00:: ; then all four---four%1:23:00:: gathering on the sofa---sofa%1:06:00:: to face the inquisitor---inquisitor%1:18:00:: .
They answered him in monosyllables---monosyllable%1:10:00:: , nods---nod%1:10:01:: , occasionally muttering in Greek---greek%1:10:00:: to one another , awaiting the word---word%1:10:06:: from Papa---person%1:03:00:: , who restlessly cracked his knuckles---knuckle%1:08:00:: , anxious to stuff himself into his white Cadillac and burst off to the freeway---freeway%1:06:00:: .
No , they had n't seen anyone around ; no , they did n't know the Andrus---person%1:03:00:: family---family%1:14:02:: ; yes , they had read about the case---case%1:10:02:: ; yes , they had let some reporters---reporter%1:18:00:: use their phone---phone%1:06:00:: , but they would no longer .
They offered no opinions---opinion%1:09:00:: , volunteered nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: , betrayed no emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: .
Studying them , McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: could not help make comparison---comparison%1:04:00:: with the Andrus---person%1:03:00:: couple---couple%1:14:01:: .
The Skopas---person%1:03:00:: people---people%1:14:02:: seemed to him of that breed of human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: whose insularity---insularity%1:26:00:: frees them from tragedy---tragedy%1:11:00:: .
He imagined they were the kind---kind%1:09:00:: whose tax returns---tax_return%1:10:00:: were never examined ( if they were , they were never penalized ) , whose children---child%1:18:01:: had no unhappy romances---romance%1:26:00:: , whose names---name%1:26:00:: never knew scandal---scandal%1:10:00:: .
The equation---equation%1:10:00:: was simple : wealth---wealth%1:26:00:: brought them happiness---happiness%1:12:00:: , and their united front---front%1:09:00:: to the world---world%1:14:02:: was their warning---warning%1:10:01:: that they meant to keep everything they had , let no one in on the secrets---secret%1:10:00:: .
By comparison---comparison%1:24:00:: , Fritzie---person%1:03:00:: and Laura Andrus---person%1:03:00:: were quivering fledglings---fledgling%1:18:00:: .
They possessed no outer fortifications---fortification%1:06:00:: , no hard shells---shell%1:27:00:: of confidence---confidence%1:09:00:: ; they had enough difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: getting from day---day%1:28:00:: to day---day%1:28:00:: , let alone having an awful crime---crime%1:04:00:: thrust upon them .
Skopas---person%1:03:00:: expressed no curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: over the case---case%1:10:02:: , offered no expression---expression%1:10:04:: of sympathy---sympathy%1:12:00:: , made no move---move%1:04:00:: to escort McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: to the door---door%1:06:01:: .
All four---four%1:23:00:: remained impacted on the sofa---sofa%1:06:00:: until he had left .
He had spoken to Mrs. Emerson---person%1:03:00:: the previous day---day%1:28:00:: .
There remained a family---family%1:14:02:: named Kahler---person%1:03:00:: , owners---owner%1:18:02:: of a two story---story%1:06:00:: Tudor style---style%1:09:01:: house---house%1:06:00:: on the south side---south_side%1:15:00:: of the Andrus---person%1:03:00:: home---home%1:06:00:: .
Their names---name%1:10:00:: had not come up in any discussions---discussion%1:10:00:: with Laura---person%1:03:00:: , and he had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: what they would be like .
McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: noted the immaculate lawn---lawn%1:15:00:: and gardens---garden%1:06:01:: : each blade---blade%1:20:00:: of grass---grass%1:20:00:: cropped , bright and firm ; each shrub---shrub%1:20:00:: glazed with good health---good_health%1:26:00:: .
The door---door%1:06:01:: was answered by a slender man---man%1:18:00:: in his sixties---sixties%1:28:00:: - straight backed , somewhat clerical in manner---manner%1:07:01:: , wearing rimless glasses---glasses%1:06:00:: .
When Joe---person%1:03:00:: identified himself , he nodded , unsmiling , and ushered him into a sedate living room---living_room%1:06:00:: .
Mrs. Kahler---person%1:03:00:: joined them .
She had a dried-out quality---quality%1:09:00:: - a gray , lean woman---woman%1:18:00:: , not unattractive .
The man---man%1:18:00:: wore a vest---vest%1:06:01:: and a tie---tie%1:06:01:: , the woman---woman%1:18:00:: had on a dark green dress---dress%1:06:00:: and three strands---strand%1:06:01:: of pearls---pearl%1:21:00:: .
`` Funny thing---thing%1:26:00:: '' , Mr. Kahler---person%1:03:00:: said , when they were seated , `` when I heard you ringing , I figured it was that guy---guy%1:18:00:: down the block---block%1:15:00:: , Hausman---person%1:03:00:: '' .
McFeeley---person%1:03:00:: looked puzzled .
Kahler---person%1:03:00:: continued : `` I fixed his dog---dog%1:05:00:: the other day---day%1:28:00:: and I guess he 's sore , so I expected him to come barging in '' .
Mr. Kahler---person%1:03:00:: went on to explain how Hausman---person%1:03:00:: 's fox terrier---fox_terrier%1:05:00:: had been `` making '' in his flower beds---flowerbed%1:06:00:: .
The dog---dog%1:05:00:: refused to be scared off , so Kahler---person%1:03:00:: had purchased some small firecrackers---firecracker%1:06:00:: .
He would lay in wait---wait%1:04:00:: in the garage---garage%1:06:00:: , and when the terrier---terrier%1:05:00:: came scratching around , he 'd let fly with a cherry bomb---cherry_bomb%1:06:00:: .
`` Scared the hell out of him '' , Kahler---person%1:03:00:: grinned .
`` I hit him in the ass---ass%1:08:00:: once '' .
Both grinned at the detective---detective%1:18:00:: .
`` Finally , all I needed was to throw a little piece---piece%1:06:05:: of red wood---wood%1:27:00:: that looked like a firecracker---firecracker%1:06:00:: and that dumb dog---dog%1:05:00:: would run ki-yi-ing for his life---life%1:26:00:: '' .
I called the other afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: on my old friend---friend%1:18:00:: , Graves Moreland---person%1:03:00:: , the Anglo-American---anglo-american%1:18:00:: literary critic---critic%1:18:00:: - his mother---mother%1:18:00:: was born in Ohio---ohio%1:15:00:: - who lives alone in a fairy-tale---fairytale%1:10:00:: cottage---cottage%1:06:00:: on the Upson Downs---location%1:03:00:: , raising hell and peacocks---peacock%1:05:02:: , the former only when the venerable gentleman---gentleman%1:18:00:: becomes an angry old man---old_man%1:18:02:: about the state---state%1:03:00:: of literature---literature%1:10:00:: or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such as human stature---stature%1:26:00:: , hope---hope%1:12:00:: , and humor---humor%1:12:00:: .
My unscientific friend---friend%1:18:00:: does not believe that human stature---stature%1:26:00:: is measurable in terms of speed---speed%1:28:00:: , momentum---momentum%1:07:01:: , weightlessness---weightlessness%1:07:00:: , or distance---distance%1:07:01:: from earth---earth%1:17:00:: , but is a matter---matter%1:09:01:: of the development---development%1:22:02:: of the human mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
After Gagarin---person%1:03:00:: became the Greatest Man---man%1:18:00:: in the World , for a nation---nation%1:14:01:: that does not believe in the cult of personality---cult_of_personality%1:09:00:: or in careerism---careerism%1:04:00:: , Moreland---person%1:03:00:: wrote me a letter---letter%1:10:00:: in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee---bee%1:05:00:: can live in a vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: , or how far it can fly .
A bee---bee%1:05:00:: 's place---place%1:26:01:: is in the hive---hive%1:06:00:: '' .
`` I have come to talk with you about the future---future%1:28:00:: of humor---humor%1:12:00:: and comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and then made us each a stiff drink---drink%1:13:04:: , with a trembling hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
`` I seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an interview---interview%1:10:00:: ten years---year%1:28:01:: ago you gave humor---humor%1:12:00:: and comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: five years---year%1:28:01:: to live .
Did you go to their funeral---funeral%1:11:00:: '' ?
`` Comedy---comedy%1:10:01:: did n't die , it just went crazy .
It has identified itself with the very tension---tension%1:26:03:: and terror---terror%1:12:00:: it once did so much---much%1:23:00:: to alleviate .
We now have not only what has been called over here the comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: of menace---menace%1:26:00:: but we also have horror---horror%1:06:00:: jokes---joke%1:10:00:: , magazines---magazine%1:10:00:: known as Horror Comics , and sick comedians---comedian%1:18:00:: .
There are even publications---publication%1:10:00:: called Sick---group%1:03:00:: and Mad .
The Zeitgeist---person%1:03:00:: is not crazy as a loon---loon%1:05:00:: or mad as a March---march%1:28:00:: hare---hare%1:05:00:: ; it is manic as a man---man%1:05:01:: '' .
`` I woke up this morning---morning%1:28:00:: '' , Moreland---person%1:03:00:: said , `` paraphrasing Lewis Carroll---person%1:03:00:: .
Do you want to hear the paraphrase---paraphrase%1:10:00:: '' ?
I asked , taking a final gulp---gulp%1:04:00:: of my drink---drink%1:13:04:: , and handing him the empty glass---glass%1:06:00:: .
`` Just barely '' , he said , and repeated his paraphrase---paraphrase%1:10:00:: :
`` The time---time%1:28:06:: has come '' , the walrus---walrus%1:05:00:: said , `` To speak of manic things---thing%1:11:00:: , Of shots---shot%1:04:00:: and shouts---shout%1:10:00:: , and sealing dooms---doom%1:11:00:: Of commoners---commoner%1:18:00:: and kings---king%1:18:00:: '' .
Moreland---person%1:03:00:: fixed us each another drink---drink%1:13:04:: , and said , `` For God---god%1:18:01:: 's sake---sake%1:07:00:: , tell me something truly amusing '' .
`` I 'll try '' , I said , and sat for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: thinking .
`` Oh yes , the other day---day%1:28:03:: I reread some of Emerson---person%1:03:00:: 's English Traits , and there was an anecdote---anecdote%1:10:00:: about a group---group%1:03:00:: of English---english%1:18:00:: and Americans---american%1:18:00:: visiting Germany---germany%1:15:00:: , more than a hundred years---year%1:28:01:: ago .
In the railway station---railway_station%1:06:00:: at Berlin---berlin%1:15:00:: , a uniformed attendant---attendant%1:18:00:: was chanting , ' Foreigners---foreigner%1:18:00:: this way---way%1:15:00:: !
Foreigners---foreigner%1:18:00:: this way---way%1:15:00:: ' !
One woman---woman%1:18:00:: - she could have been either English or American - went up to him and said , ' But you are the foreigners---foreigner%1:18:00:: '' ' .
I took a deep breath---breath%1:04:00:: and an even deeper swallow---swallow%1:04:00:: of my drink---drink%1:13:04:: , and said , `` I admit that going back to Ralph Waldo Emerson---person%1:03:00:: for humor---humor%1:12:00:: is like going to a modern musical comedy---musical_comedy%1:10:00:: for music---music%1:10:00:: and comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: '' .
`` What 's the matter with the music---music%1:10:00:: '' ?
Moreland---person%1:03:00:: asked .
`` It does n't drown out the dialogue---dialogue%1:10:01:: '' , I explained .
`` Let 's talk about books---book%1:06:00:: '' , Moreland---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` I am told that in America---america%1:15:00:: you have non books---book%1:06:00:: by non writers---writer%1:18:00:: , brought out by non publishers---publisher%1:14:00:: for non readers---reader%1:18:00:: .
Is it all non-fiction---nonfiction%1:10:00:: '' ?
`` There is non-fiction---nonfiction%1:10:00:: and non non-fiction---nonfiction%1:10:00:: '' , I said .
`` Speaking of nonism : the other day---day%1:28:03:: , in a story---story%1:10:03:: about a sit-down---sit-down%1:04:00:: demonstration---demonstration%1:04:01:: , the Paris Herald Tribune wrote , ' The non violence---violence%1:04:01:: became noisier ' .
And then Eichmann---person%1:03:00:: was quoted as saying , in non English---english%1:10:00:: , that Hitler---person%1:03:00:: 's plan---plan%1:09:01:: to exterminate the Jews---jew%1:18:00:: was nonsense---nonsense%1:10:00:: '' .
`` If we cannot tell evil---evil%1:07:00:: , horror---horror%1:06:00:: , and insanity---insanity%1:26:00:: from nonsense , what is the future---future%1:28:00:: of humor---humor%1:12:00:: and comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: '' ?
Moreland---person%1:03:00:: asked , grimly .
`` They require , for existence---existence%1:26:00:: , a brave spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: and a high heart---heart%1:07:01:: , and where do you find these ?
In our present era---era%1:28:00:: of Science and Angst---angst%1:12:00:: , the heart---heart%1:09:00:: has been downgraded , to use one of our popular retrogressive verbs---verb%1:10:00:: '' .
`` I know what you mean '' , Moreland---person%1:03:00:: sighed .
`` Last year---year%1:28:01:: your Tennessee Williams---person%1:03:00:: told our Dilys Powell---person%1:03:00:: , in a television program---television_program%1:10:00:: , that it is the task---task%1:04:00:: of the playwright---playwright%1:18:00:: to throw light---light%1:09:00:: into the dark corners---corner%1:15:02:: of the human heart---heart%1:09:00:: .
Like almost everybody else , he confused the heart---heart%1:09:00:: , both as organ---organ%1:08:00:: and as symbol---symbol%1:10:00:: , with the disturbed psyche---psyche%1:18:00:: , the deranged glands---gland%1:08:00:: , and the jumpy central nervous system---central_nervous_system%1:08:00:: .
I'm not pleading for the heart---heart%1:09:00:: that leaps up when it beholds a rainbow---rainbow%1:17:00:: in the sky---sky%1:17:00:: , or for the heart---heart%1:09:00:: that with rapture---rapture%1:26:00:: fills and dances with the daffodils---daffodil%1:20:00:: .
The sentimental pure heart---heart%1:09:00:: of Galahad---person%1:03:00:: is gone with the knightly years---year%1:28:01:: , but I still believe in the heart---heart%1:09:00:: of the George Meredith---person%1:03:00:: character---character%1:18:02:: that was not made of the stuff---stuff%1:27:00:: that breaks---break%1:04:00:: '' .
`` We no longer have Tom Moore---person%1:03:00:: 's and Longfellow---person%1:03:00:: 's ' heart---heart%1:09:00:: for any fate---fate%1:11:00:: ' , either '' , I said .
`` Moore---person%1:03:00:: and Longfellow---person%1:03:00:: did n't have the fate---fate%1:11:00:: that faces us '' , Moreland---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` One day---day%1:28:03:: our species---species%1:14:00:: promises co-existence---coexistence%1:26:00:: , and the next day---day%1:28:03:: it threatens co extinction '' .
We sat for a while drinking in silence---silence%1:07:01:: .
`` The heart---heart%1:09:00:: '' , I said finally , `` is now either in the throat---throat%1:08:00:: or the mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: or the stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: or the shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: .
When it was worn in the breast---breast%1:08:01:: , or even on the sleeve---sleeve%1:06:00:: , we at least knew where it was '' .
There was a long silence---silence%1:07:01:: .
`` You have visited England---england%1:15:00:: five times---time%1:11:00:: in the past quarter-century---quarter-century%1:28:00:: , I believe '' , my host---host%1:18:01:: said .
`` What has impressed you most on your present visit---visit%1:04:01:: '' ?
`` I should say it is the turning---turning%1:04:01:: of courts---court%1:06:02:: of law---law%1:10:00:: into veritable theatres---theatre%1:06:00:: for sex---sex%1:04:00:: dramas---drama%1:11:00:: , involving clergymen---clergyman%1:18:00:: and parishioners---parishioner%1:18:00:: , psychiatrists---psychiatrist%1:18:00:: and patients---patient%1:18:00:: .
It is becoming harder and harder to tell law---law%1:10:00:: courts---court%1:06:02:: and political arenas---political_arena%1:26:00:: from the modern theatre---theatre%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Do you think we need a new Henry James---person%1:03:00:: to re-explore the Anglo-American---anglo-american%1:18:00:: scene---scene%1:15:00:: '' ? he asked .
`` Or perhaps a new Noel Coward---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` But you must have heard it said that the drawing-room---drawing_room%1:06:00:: disappeared forever with the somnolent years---year%1:28:01:: of James---person%1:03:00:: and the antic heyday---heyday%1:28:00:: of Coward---person%1:03:00:: .
I myself hear it said constantly - in drawing-rooms---drawing_room%1:06:00:: .
In them , there is usually a group---group%1:03:00:: of Anglo-Americans---anglo-american%1:18:00:: with tragicomic problems---problem%1:26:00:: , worthy of being explored either in the novel---novel%1:10:00:: or in the play---play%1:10:01:: or in comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: and satire---satire%1:10:00:: '' .
`` If you are trying to get us out of the brothel---brothel%1:06:00:: , the dustbin---dustbin%1:06:00:: , the kitchen sink---kitchen_sink%1:06:00:: , and the tawdry living-room---living_room%1:06:00:: , you are probably wasting your time---time%1:28:05:: '' , Moreland---person%1:03:00:: told me .
`` Too many of our writers---writer%1:18:00:: seem to be interested only in creatures---creature%1:03:00:: that crawl out of the woodwork---woodwork%1:06:00:: or from under the rock---rock%1:17:01:: '' .
`` I am worried about the current meanings---meaning%1:09:00:: of the word---word%1:10:00:: ' funny ' .
It now means ominous , as when one speaks of a funny sound---sound%1:07:00:: in the motor---motor%1:06:00:: ; disturbing , as when one says that a friend---friend%1:18:00:: is acting funny ; and frightening , as when a wife---wife%1:18:00:: tells the police---police%1:14:00:: that it is funny , but her husband---husband%1:18:00:: has n't been home for two days---day%1:28:02:: and nights---night%1:28:00:: '' .
Moreland---person%1:03:00:: sat brooding for a full minute---minute%1:28:00:: , during which I made each of us a new drink---drink%1:13:04:: .
He took his glass---glass%1:06:00:: , clinked it against mine , and said , `` Toujours gai , what the hell '' ! borrowing a line---line%1:10:02:: from Don Marquis---person%1:03:00:: ' Mehitabel .
`` Be careful of the word---word%1:10:00:: ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergone a change---change%1:11:00:: .
It now means , in my country---country%1:15:00:: , homosexual---homosexual%1:18:00:: '' , I said .
`` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house---funny_house%1:06:00:: in the funny wagon---funny_wagon%1:06:00:: , he is removed to a mental institution---mental_institution%1:06:00:: in an ambulance---ambulance%1:06:00:: .
Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire---questionnaire%1:10:00:: in which I was asked whether or not I was non institutionalized '' .
My host---host%1:18:01:: went over and stared out the window---window%1:06:00:: at his peacocks---peacock%1:05:01:: ; then he turned to me .
`` Is it true that you believe the other animals---animal%1:03:00:: are saner than the human species---species%1:14:00:: '' ?
`` Do you remember the woman---woman%1:18:00:: in the French Alps---location%1:03:00:: who was all alone with her sheep---sheep%1:05:00:: one day---day%1:28:03:: when the sun---sun%1:17:00:: darkened ominously ?
She told the sheep---sheep%1:05:00:: , ' The world---world%1:17:01:: is coming to an end---end%1:11:00:: ' !
And the sheep---sheep%1:05:00:: said - all in unison , I have no doubt - ' Ba-a-a ' !
The sound---sound%1:07:00:: mockery---mockery%1:10:00:: of sheep---sheep%1:05:00:: is like the salubrious horse laugh---horselaugh%1:10:00:: '' .
`` That is only partly non nonsense---nonsense%1:10:00:: '' , he began .
`` If you saw the drama---drama%1:10:01:: called Rhinoceros '' , I said , `` think of the effect---effect%1:07:00:: it would have on an audience---audience%1:14:00:: of rhinos---rhino%1:05:00:: when the actor---actor%1:18:00:: on stage---stage%1:06:00:: suddenly begins turning into a rhinoceros---rhinoceros%1:05:00:: .
The rhinos---rhino%1:05:00:: would panic , screaming ' Help ' !
- if that can be screamed in their language---language%1:10:00:: '' .
`` You think the Russians---russian%1:18:00:: are getting ahead of us in comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: '' ?
Moreland---person%1:03:00:: demanded .
`` The political and intellectual Left---left%1:14:00:: began fighting humor---humor%1:10:00:: and comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: years---year%1:28:01:: ago , because they fear things---thing%1:09:00:: they do not understand and cannot manage , such as satire---satire%1:10:00:: and irony---irony%1:10:01:: , such as humor---humor%1:10:00:: and comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: .
Nevertheless , like any other human being---human_being%1:05:00:: upon whom the spotlight---spotlight%1:26:00:: of the world---world%1:14:02:: plays---play%1:04:04:: continually , Khrushchev---person%1:03:00:: , the anti personality---personality%1:18:00:: cultist---cultist%1:18:00:: , has become a comic actor---actor%1:18:00:: , or thinks he has .
In his famous meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: with Nixon---person%1:03:00:: a couple of years---year%1:28:01:: ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as Ed Wynn---person%1:03:00:: .
But , like Caesar---caesar%1:18:00:: , he has only one joke---joke%1:10:00:: , so far as I can find out .
It consists in saying , ' That would be sending the goat---goat%1:05:00:: to look after the cabbage---cabbage%1:13:00:: ' .
Moreland---person%1:03:00:: asked .
`` Such as ' sending the cat---cat%1:05:00:: to guard the mice---mouse%1:05:00:: ' , or ' the falcon---falcon%1:05:00:: to protect the dove---dove%1:05:00:: ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human being---human_being%1:05:00:: to save humanity '' ' .
`` You and I have fallen out of literature---literature%1:09:00:: into politics---politics%1:09:00:: '' , Moreland---person%1:03:00:: observed .
`` What a nasty fall---fall%1:04:01:: was there '' !
`` What a nasty fall---fall%1:04:03:: was there '' !
Moreland---person%1:03:00:: went over to stare at his peacocks---peacock%1:05:01:: again , and then came back and sat down , restively .
`` The world that was once foot-loose and fancy-free '' , he said , `` has now become screw-loose and frenzy---frenzy%1:26:00:: free .
In our age---age%1:28:02:: of Science and Angst---angst%1:12:00:: it seems to me more brave to stay on Earth---earth%1:17:00:: and explore inner man---man%1:05:01:: than to fly far from the sphere---sphere%1:26:00:: of our sorrow---sorrow%1:12:00:: and explore outer space---outer_space%1:15:00:: '' .
`` The human ego---ego%1:12:01:: being what it is '' , I put in , `` science fiction---science_fiction%1:10:00:: has always assumed that the creatures---creature%1:03:00:: on the planets---planet%1:17:00:: of a thousand larger solar systems---solar_system%1:17:00:: than ours must look like gigantic tube-nosed fruit bats---tube-nosed_fruit_bat%1:05:00:: .
It seems to me that the first human being---human_being%1:05:00:: to reach one of these planets---planet%1:17:00:: may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species---species%1:14:00:: '' .
`` Now we are leaving humor---humor%1:10:00:: and comedy---comedy%1:10:00:: behind again '' , Moreland---person%1:03:00:: protested .
`` Not in the largest sense of the words---word%1:10:00:: '' , I said .
`` The other day---day%1:28:03:: Arnold Toynbee---person%1:03:00:: spoke against the inveterate tendency---tendency%1:09:00:: of our species---species%1:14:00:: to believe in the uniqueness---uniqueness%1:07:00:: of its religions---religion%1:09:00:: , its ideologies---ideology%1:09:01:: , and its virtually everything else .
Why do we not realize that no ideology---ideology%1:09:01:: believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else ?
Forty years---year%1:28:01:: ago an English writer---writer%1:18:00:: , W. L. George---person%1:03:00:: , dealt with this subject---subject%1:10:00:: in Eddies of the Day , and said , as an example---example%1:09:00:: , that ' Saint George---person%1:03:00:: for Merry England---location%1:03:00:: ' would not start a spirit---spirit%1:18:00:: half so quickly as ' Strike frog---frog%1:05:00:: eating Frenchmen---frenchman%1:18:00:: dead '' ' !
`` There was also Gott strafe Angleterre '' , Moreland---person%1:03:00:: reminded me , `` and Carthago delenda est , or if you will , Deus strafe Carthage .
It is n't what the ideologist---ideologist%1:18:00:: believes in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy---jeopardy%1:26:00:: .
This is the force---force%1:07:01:: , in our time---time%1:28:00:: and in every other time---time%1:28:00:: , that urges the paranoiac---paranoiac%1:18:00:: and the manic-depressive---manic-depressive%1:18:00:: to become head---head%1:18:00:: of a state---state%1:14:00:: .
Complete power---power%1:07:00:: not only corrupts but it also attracts the mad .
There is a bitter satire---satire%1:10:00:: for a future writer---writer%1:18:00:: in that '' .
`` Great satire---satire%1:10:00:: has always been clearly written and readily understandable '' , I said .
`` But we now find writers---writer%1:18:00:: obsessed by the nooks and crannies---nooks_and_crannies%1:09:00:: of their ivory towers---ivory_tower%1:09:00:: , and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity---obscurity%1:07:02:: and complexity---complexity%1:07:00:: of poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: and non poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: .
I wrote a few years---year%1:28:01:: ago that one of the cardinal rules---rule%1:10:00:: of writing---writing%1:10:00:: is that the reader---reader%1:18:02:: should be able to get some idea---idea%1:09:00:: of what the story---story%1:10:03:: is about .
Cook---person%1:03:00:: had discovered a beef---beef%1:13:00:: in his possession---possession%1:04:00:: a few days---day%1:28:00:: earlier and , when he could not show the hide---hide%1:27:00:: , arrested him .
Thinking the evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: insufficient to get a conviction---conviction%1:04:00:: , he later released him .
Even while suffering the trip---trip%1:04:00:: to his home---home%1:15:02:: , Cook---person%1:03:00:: swore to Moore---person%1:03:00:: and Lane---person%1:03:00:: that he would kill the Indian---indian%1:18:00:: .
Three weeks---week%1:28:00:: later following his recovery---recovery%1:11:00:: , armed with a writ---writ%1:10:00:: issued by the Catskill---location%1:03:00:: justice---justice%1:18:00:: on affidavits---affidavit%1:10:00:: prepared by the district attorney---district_attorney%1:18:00:: , Cook---person%1:03:00:: and Russell---person%1:03:00:: rode to arrest Martinez---person%1:03:00:: .
Arriving at daybreak---daybreak%1:28:00:: , they found Julio---person%1:03:00:: in his corral---corral%1:06:00:: and demanded that he surrender .
Instead , he whirled and ran to his house---house%1:06:00:: for a gun---gun%1:06:00:: forcing them to kill him , Cook---person%1:03:00:: reported .
Both Cook---person%1:03:00:: 's and Russell---person%1:03:00:: 's lives---life%1:26:00:: were threatened by the Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: following the killing---killing%1:11:00:: , but the company---company%1:14:03:: officers---officer%1:18:03:: felt that in the end , it would serve to quiet them despite their immediate emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: .
General manager---general_manager%1:18:00:: Pels---person%1:03:00:: even suggested that it might be wise to keep the Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: in suspense---suspense%1:09:00:: rather than accept their offers---offer%1:10:00:: to sell out and move away , and try to have a few punished .
On February---february%1:28:00:: 17 , Russell---person%1:03:00:: and Cook---person%1:03:00:: were sent to the Pena Flor---location%1:03:00:: community---community%1:14:00:: on the Vermejo---location%1:03:00:: to see about renting out ranches---ranch%1:06:00:: the company---company%1:14:03:: had purchased .
While talking with Julian M. Beall---person%1:03:00:: , Francisco Archuleta---person%1:03:00:: and Juan Marcus---person%1:03:00:: appeared , both heavily armed , and after watching the house---house%1:06:00:: for a while , rode away .
It was nearly sundown---sundown%1:28:00:: before they finished the business---business%1:09:00:: with Beall---person%1:03:00:: and began riding down the stream---stream%1:17:00:: .
They had traveled only a short distance---distance%1:07:00:: when they spotted five Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: riding along a horse-trail---horse-trail%1:06:00:: across the stream---stream%1:17:00:: just ahead of them .
Suspecting an ambush---ambush%1:04:00:: , the two deputies---deputy%1:18:01:: decided to ride up a side canyon---canyon%1:17:00:: taking a short cut---shortcut%1:06:00:: into Catskill---location%1:03:00:: .
After spending two nights---night%1:28:00:: ( Wednesday---wednesday%1:28:00:: and Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: ) in Catskill---location%1:03:00:: , the deputies---deputy%1:18:01:: again headed for the Vermejo---location%1:03:00:: to finish their business---business%1:09:00:: .
They stayed with a rancher---rancher%1:18:00:: Friday---friday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: and by eleven o'clock Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: morning---morning%1:28:00:: passed the old Garnett Lee---person%1:03:00:: ranch---ranch%1:06:00:: .
Half a mile---mile%1:23:01:: below at the mouth---mouth%1:17:01:: of Salyer 's Canyon---location%1:03:00:: was an old ranch---ranch%1:06:00:: that the company---company%1:14:01:: had purchased from A. J. Armstrong---person%1:03:00:: , occupied by a Mexican---mexican%1:18:00:: , his wife---wife%1:18:00:: , and an old trapper---trapper%1:18:00:: .
There were three houses---house%1:06:00:: in Salyer 's Canyon---location%1:03:00:: just at the foot---foot%1:15:00:: of a low bluff---bluff%1:17:00:: , the road---road%1:06:00:: winding along the top---top%1:15:01:: , entering above , and then passing down in front of the houses---house%1:06:00:: , thence to the Vermejo---location%1:03:00:: .
To the west---west%1:24:00:: of this road---road%1:06:00:: was another low bluff---bluff%1:17:00:: , forty or fifty feet---foot%1:23:00:: high , covered with scrub oak---scrub_oak%1:20:00:: and other brush---brush%1:14:00:: .
As they were riding along this winding road---road%1:06:00:: on the bench---bench%1:17:00:: of land---land%1:17:00:: between the two bluffs---bluff%1:17:00:: , a volley---volley%1:04:00:: of rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: fire---fire%1:04:00:: suddenly crashed around the two officers---officer%1:18:01:: .
Not a bullet---bullet%1:06:00:: touched Cook---person%1:03:00:: who was nearer the ambush---ambush%1:04:00:: , but one hit Russell---person%1:03:00:: in the leg---leg%1:08:01:: and another broke his arm---arm%1:08:00:: , passing on through his body---body%1:08:00:: .
With the first reports---report%1:11:00:: , Russell---person%1:03:00:: 's horse---horse%1:05:00:: wheeled to the right---right%1:15:00:: and ran towards the buildings---building%1:06:00:: while Cook---person%1:03:00:: , followed by a hail---hail%1:19:00:: of bullets---bullet%1:06:00:: , raced towards the arroyo---arroyo%1:17:00:: of Salyer 's Canyon---location%1:03:00:: immediately in front of him , just reaching it as his horse---horse%1:05:00:: fell .
Grabbing his Winchester from its sheath---sheath%1:06:00:: , Cook---person%1:03:00:: prepared to fight from behind the arroyo---arroyo%1:17:00:: bank---bank%1:17:00:: .
Bullets---bullet%1:06:00:: were so thick , throwing sand---sand%1:27:00:: in his face---face%1:08:00:: , that he found it difficult to return the fire---fire%1:04:00:: .
Noticing Russell---person%1:03:00:: 's horse---horse%1:05:00:: in front of the long log building---building%1:06:00:: , he assumed his friend---friend%1:18:00:: had slipped inside and would be able to put up a good fight---fight%1:04:02:: , so he began working his way---way%1:06:00:: down the ditch---ditch%1:06:00:: to join him .
At a very shallow place---place%1:15:00:: , two Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: rushed into the open---open%1:15:01:: for a shot---shot%1:04:00:: .
Dropping to one knee---knee%1:08:00:: , Cook---cook%1:18:00:: felled one , and the other struggled off with his comrade---comrade%1:18:00:: , sending no further fire---fire%1:04:00:: in his direction---direction%1:15:00:: .
Just before leaving the arroyo---arroyo%1:17:00:: where he was partially concealed , he did hear shots---shot%1:04:00:: down at the house---house%1:06:00:: .
Russell---person%1:03:00:: had reached the house---house%1:06:00:: as Cook---person%1:03:00:: surmised , dismounted , but just as the old trapper---trapper%1:18:00:: opened the door---door%1:06:00:: to receive him , he fell into the trapper---trapper%1:18:00:: 's arms---arm%1:08:00:: - dead .
A bullet---bullet%1:06:00:: fired by one of the Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: hiding in a little chicken---chicken%1:05:01:: house---house%1:06:00:: had passed through his head---head%1:08:00:: , tearing a hole---hole%1:06:00:: two inches---inch%1:23:00:: square on the outgoing side---side%1:06:00:: .
Finding him dead , Cook---person%1:03:00:: caught Russell---person%1:03:00:: 's horse---horse%1:05:00:: and rode to the cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: foreman---foreman%1:18:00:: 's house---house%1:06:00:: to report the incident---incident%1:11:00:: and request bloodhounds---bloodhound%1:05:00:: to trail the assassins---assassin%1:18:00:: .
Before daylight---daylight%1:28:00:: Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: morning---morning%1:28:00:: , a posse---posse%1:14:00:: of twenty-three men---man%1:18:00:: under the leadership---leadership%1:04:00:: of Deputy Sheriff Frank MacPherson---person%1:03:00:: of Catskill---location%1:03:00:: followed the trail---trail%1:09:00:: to the house---house%1:06:00:: of Francisco Chaves---person%1:03:00:: , where 100 to 150 Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: had gathered .
MacPherson---person%1:03:00:: boldly approached the fortified adobe house---adobe_house%1:06:00:: and demanded entrance---entrance%1:04:00:: .
The men---men%1:14:00:: inside informed him that they had some wounded men---men%1:14:00:: among them but he would not be allowed to see them even though he offered medical aid---medical_aid%1:04:00:: .
The officer---officer%1:18:01:: demanded the names---name%1:14:00:: of the injured men---man%1:18:00:: ; the Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: not only refused to give them , but told the possemen---posseman%1:18:00:: if they wanted a fight---fight%1:04:02:: they could have it .
Since the strength---strength%1:07:00:: of the Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: had been underrated , too small a posse---posse%1:14:00:: had been collected , and since the deputy---deputy%1:18:01:: had not been provided with search warrants---search_warrant%1:10:00:: , MacPherson---person%1:03:00:: and his men---man%1:18:00:: decided it was much wiser to withdraw .
The posse---posse%1:14:00:: 's retreat---retreat%1:04:00:: encouraged the Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: to be overbearing and impudent .
During the following week---week%1:28:00:: , six tons---ton%1:23:02:: of hay---hay%1:13:00:: belonging to one rancher---rancher%1:18:00:: were burned ; some buildings---building%1:06:00:: , farm---farm%1:06:00:: tools---tool%1:06:00:: , two horses---horse%1:05:00:: , plows---plow%1:06:00:: , and hay---hay%1:13:00:: owned by Bonito Lavato---person%1:03:00:: , a friendly interpreter---interpreter%1:18:01:: for the company---company%1:14:01:: , and Pedro Chavez---person%1:03:00:: ' hay---hay%1:13:00:: were stolen or destroyed ; and a store---store%1:06:00:: was broken into and robbed .
District Attorney---district_attorney%1:18:00:: M. W. Mills---person%1:03:00:: warned that he would vigorously prosecute persons---person%1:03:00:: caught committing these crimes---crime%1:04:00:: or carrying arms---arms%1:06:00:: - he just did n't catch anyone .
Increasing threats---threat%1:10:00:: on his life---life%1:26:00:: finally convinced Cook---person%1:03:00:: that he should leave New Mexico---new_mexico%1:15:00:: .
His friends---friend%1:18:00:: advised that it would be only a question---question%1:10:01:: of time---time%1:28:05:: until either the Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: killed him by ambuscade---ambuscade%1:04:00:: or he would be compelled to kill them in self-defense---self-defense%1:04:00:: , perpetuating the troubles---trouble%1:11:00:: .
By early summer---summer%1:28:00:: , he wrote from Laramie---location%1:03:00:: that he was suffering from the wound---wound%1:26:00:: inflicted in the ambush---ambush%1:04:00:: and was in a bad way financially , so Pels---person%1:03:00:: sent him a draft---draft%1:21:00:: for $ 100 , warning that it was still not wise for him to return .
Pels---person%1:03:00:: also sent a check---check%1:21:00:: for $ 100 to Russell---person%1:03:00:: 's widow---widow%1:18:00:: and had a white marble---marble%1:27:00:: monument---monument%1:06:00:: erected on his grave---grave%1:06:00:: .
Cattle---cattle%1:05:00:: stealing and killing---killing%1:04:00:: , again serious during the spring---spring%1:28:00:: of 1891 , placed the land grant---land_grant%1:21:00:: company---company%1:14:01:: officers---officer%1:18:02:: in a perplexing position---position%1:09:00:: .
They were reluctant to appoint sheriffs---sheriff%1:18:00:: to protect the property---property%1:15:00:: , thus running the risk of creating disturbances---disturbance%1:11:00:: such as that on the Vermejo---location%1:03:00:: , and yet the cowboys---cowboy%1:18:00:: protested that they got no salary---salary%1:21:00:: for arresting cattle thieves---cattle_thief%1:18:00:: and running the risk of being shot .
And the law---law%1:14:01:: virtually ignored the situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
The judge---judge%1:18:00:: became ill just as the Colfax District Court---group%1:03:00:: convened , no substitute---substitute%1:09:00:: was brought in , no criminal cases---case%1:04:00:: heard , only 5 out of 122 cases---case%1:04:00:: docketed were tried , and court---court%1:14:00:: adjourned sine die after sitting a few days---day%1:28:00:: instead of the usual three weeks---week%1:28:00:: .
Pels---person%1:03:00:: complained :
`` Litigants and witnesses were put to the expense and inconvenience of going long distances to transact business ; public money spent ; justice delayed ; nothing accomplished , and the whole distribution of justice---justice%1:07:00:: in this county seems to be an absolute farce '' .
`` Litigants---litigant%1:18:00:: and witnesses---witness%1:18:00:: were put to the expense---expense%1:21:00:: and inconvenience---inconvenience%1:26:00:: of going long distances---distance%1:07:00:: to transact business---business%1:04:01:: ; public money---money%1:21:00:: spent ; justice---justice%1:04:00:: delayed ; nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: accomplished , and the whole distribution---distribution%1:04:00:: of justice---justice%1:04:00:: in this county---county%1:15:00:: seems to be an absolute farce---farce%1:10:00:: '' .
Word---word%1:10:03:: reached the company---company%1:14:01:: that the man---man%1:18:00:: behind these depredations---depredation%1:04:00:: was Manuel Gonzales---person%1:03:00:: , a man---man%1:18:00:: with many followers---follower%1:18:00:: , including a number---number%1:07:00:: who were kept in line---line%1:04:01:: through fear---fear%1:12:00:: of him .
Although wanted by the sheriff---sheriff%1:18:00:: for killing an old man---old_man%1:18:02:: named Asher Jones---person%1:03:00:: , the warrant---warrant%1:10:00:: for his arrest---arrest%1:04:00:: had never been served .
On May---may%1:28:00:: 19 , a deputy sheriff---deputy_sheriff%1:18:00:: 's posse---posse%1:14:00:: of eight men---man%1:18:00:: left Maxwell City---location%1:03:00:: and rode thirty-five miles---mile%1:23:01:: up the Vermejo---location%1:03:00:: where they were joined by Juan Jose Martinez---person%1:03:00:: .
By 3 : 00 A.M. they reached his house---house%1:06:00:: and found it vacant .
When they were refused entrance---entrance%1:04:00:: to his brother---brother%1:18:00:: 's house---house%1:06:00:: nearby , they smashed down the door---door%1:06:00:: , broke the window---window%1:06:00:: , and threw lighted clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: wet with kerosene---kerosene%1:27:00:: into the room---room%1:06:00:: .
Still there was no Gonzales---person%1:03:00:: and the family---family%1:14:00:: would say nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
About 300 yards---yard%1:23:00:: up the creek---creek%1:17:00:: was a cluster---cluster%1:14:00:: of Mexican houses---house%1:06:00:: containing six rooms---room%1:06:00:: in the form---form%1:07:01:: of a square---square%1:25:00:: .
While prowling around these buildings---building%1:06:00:: , two of the posse---posse%1:14:00:: recognized the voice---voice%1:07:00:: of Gonzales---person%1:03:00:: speaking to the people---people%1:14:00:: inside .
He was promised that no harm---harm%1:26:00:: would befall him if he would come out , but he cursed and replied that he would shoot any man---man%1:18:00:: coming near the door---door%1:06:01:: .
The posse---posse%1:14:00:: then asked that he send out the women---woman%1:18:00:: and children---child%1:18:00:: as the building---building%1:06:00:: would be fired or torn down over his head---head%1:08:00:: if necessary to take him dead or alive .
In deadly earnest---earnest%1:21:00:: , the besiegers---besieger%1:18:00:: methodically stripped away portions---portion%1:06:00:: of the roof---roof%1:06:00:: and tossed lighted rags---rag%1:06:00:: inside , only to have most stamped out by the women---woman%1:18:00:: as soon as they hit the floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
When it became obvious that he could stay inside no longer , taking a thousand to one---one%1:23:00:: chance---chance%1:04:00:: Gonzales---person%1:03:00:: rushed outside , square against the muzzle---muzzle%1:06:01:: of a Winchester .
Shot near the heart---heart%1:08:00:: , he turned to one side---side%1:08:00:: and plunged for a door---door%1:06:01:: to another room---room%1:06:00:: several feet---foot%1:23:00:: away , three bullets---bullet%1:06:00:: following him .
As he pushed open the door---door%1:06:00:: he fell on his face---face%1:08:00:: , one of his comrades---comrade%1:18:00:: pulling him inside .
Not realizing the seriousness---seriousness%1:07:01:: of the wound---wound%1:26:00:: , the besiegers---besieger%1:18:00:: warned that if he did not surrender the house---house%1:06:00:: would be burned down around him .
Receiving no answer---answer%1:10:00:: , they set the fire .
When the house---house%1:06:00:: was about half consumed , his comrade---comrade%1:18:00:: ran to the door---door%1:06:00:: and threw up his hands---hand%1:08:00:: , declaring repeatedly that he did not know the whereabouts---whereabouts%1:15:00:: of Manuel---person%1:03:00:: .
Finding it true that he was not inside , the deputies---deputy%1:18:01:: returned to the first house---house%1:06:00:: and tore holes---hole%1:06:00:: through the side---side%1:06:00:: and the roof---roof%1:06:00:: until they could see a body---body%1:08:00:: on the bed---bed%1:06:00:: covered by a blanket---blanket%1:06:00:: .
Several slugs---slug%1:06:00:: fired into the bed---bed%1:06:00:: jerked aside the blanket---blanket%1:06:00:: to reveal an apparently lifeless hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
Shot six or eight times---time%1:11:00:: the body---body%1:08:00:: was draped with Russell---person%1:03:00:: 's pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: , belt---belt%1:06:00:: , and cartridges---cartridge%1:06:00:: .
There was no extra horse---horse%1:05:00:: so it was left to his comrades---comrade%1:18:00:: who , though numbering in the fifties---fifty%1:23:00:: , had stood around on the hillside---hillside%1:17:00:: nearby without firing a shot---shot%1:06:00:: during the entire attack---attack%1:04:00:: .
Early the next morning---morning%1:28:00:: , a Mexican---mexican%1:18:00:: telephoned Pels---person%1:03:00:: that Celso Chavez---person%1:03:00:: , one of the posse---posse%1:14:00:: members---member%1:18:00:: , was surrounded by ten Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: at his father---father%1:18:00:: 's home---home%1:06:00:: on the upper Vermejo---location%1:03:00:: .
The sheriff---sheriff%1:18:00:: and District Attorney Mills---person%1:03:00:: hastily swore out a number---number%1:07:00:: of warrants---warrant%1:10:00:: against men---man%1:18:00:: who had been riding about armed , according to signed statements---statement%1:10:02:: by Chavez---person%1:03:00:: and Dr. I. P. George---person%1:03:00:: , and ordered Deputy Barney Clark---person%1:03:00:: of Raton---location%1:03:00:: to rescue the posseman---posseman%1:18:00:: .
Traveling all night---night%1:28:00:: , Clark---person%1:03:00:: and twelve men---man%1:18:00:: arrived at about seven o'clock May---may%1:28:00:: 22 .
Occasionally they heard gun-shot---gunshot%1:04:00:: signals---signal%1:10:00:: and a number---number%1:07:00:: of horsemen---horseman%1:18:00:: were sighted on the hills , disappearing at the posse---posse%1:14:00:: 's approach---approach%1:04:00:: .
A Mexican justice of the peace---justice_of_the_peace%1:18:00:: had issue a writ---writ%1:10:00:: against Chavez---person%1:03:00:: for taking part in the `` murder---murder%1:04:00:: '' of Manuel Gonzales---person%1:03:00:: so he and his father---father%1:18:00:: were anxious to be taken out of danger---danger%1:26:00:: .
The men---man%1:18:00:: helped them gather their belongings---belongings%1:21:00:: and escorted them to Raton---location%1:03:00:: along with three other families---family%1:14:02:: desiring to leave .
The ten or more dangerous parties---party%1:14:02:: singled out for prosecution---prosecution%1:04:00:: were still at large , and Pels---person%1:03:00:: realized that if these men---man%1:18:00:: entrenched themselves in their adobe houses---adobe_house%1:06:00:: , defending themselves through loopholes---loophole%1:06:00:: , it would be most difficult to capture them .
Thus he wired J. P. Lower and Sons---group%1:03:00:: of Denver---denver%1:15:00:: : `` Have you any percussion---percussion%1:04:00:: hand grenades---hand_grenade%1:06:00:: for throwing in a house---house%1:06:00:: or across a well---well%1:06:00:: loaded with balls---ball%1:06:03:: or shrapnel---shrapnel%1:06:00:: shot---shot%1:06:00:: ?
If not , how long to order and what is the price---price%1:21:00:: '' ?
He wisely decided that it would be foolish to create a disturbance---disturbance%1:04:01:: during the coming roundup---roundup%1:04:01:: , particularly since the Mexicans---mexican%1:18:00:: were on their guard .
His problem---problem%1:26:00:: then became one of restraining the American fighters---fighter%1:18:02:: who wanted to clean out the Vermejo---person%1:03:00:: by force---force%1:04:01:: immediately .
Experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: were made on an electric arc---arc%1:19:00:: applying a porous graphite---graphite%1:27:00:: anode---anode%1:06:00:: cooled by a transpiring gas---gas%1:27:00:: ( Argon---argon%1:27:00:: ) .
Thus , the energy---energy%1:19:00:: transferred from the arc---arc%1:19:00:: to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: was partly fed back into the arc---arc%1:19:00:: .
It was shown that by proper anode---anode%1:06:00:: design---design%1:04:00:: the net energy---energy%1:19:00:: loss---loss%1:22:00:: of the arc---arc%1:19:00:: to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: could be reduced to approximately 15 % of the total arc---arc%1:19:00:: energy---energy%1:19:00:: A detailed energy---energy%1:19:00:: balance---balance%1:26:00:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: was established .
The anode---anode%1:06:00:: ablation---ablation%1:04:00:: could be reduced to a negligible amount---amount%1:07:00:: .
The dependence---dependence%1:26:00:: of the arc---arc%1:19:00:: voltage---voltage%1:19:02:: upon the mass---mass%1:07:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: of the transpirating gas---gas%1:27:00:: was investigated for various arc---arc%1:19:00:: lengths---length%1:07:00:: and currents---current%1:19:01:: between 100 Amp---amp%1:23:00:: and 200 Amp---amp%1:23:00:: .
Qualitative observations---observation%1:04:01:: were made and high-speed motion pictures---motion_picture%1:10:00:: were taken to study flow---flow%1:11:00:: phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: in the arc---arc%1:19:00:: at various mass---mass%1:07:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: velocities---velocity%1:28:00:: .
The high heat---heat%1:19:00:: fluxes---flux%1:11:00:: existing at the electrode---electrode%1:06:00:: surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: of electric arcs---arc%1:19:00:: necessitate extensive cooling---cooling%1:22:00:: to prevent electrode---electrode%1:06:00:: ablation---ablation%1:04:00:: .
The cooling---cooling%1:22:00:: requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: are particularly severe at the anode---anode%1:06:00:: .
In free burning electric arcs---arc%1:19:00:: , for instance , approximately 90 % of the total arc---arc%1:19:00:: power---power%1:19:00:: is transferred to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: giving rise to local heat---heat%1:19:00:: fluxes---flux%1:11:00:: in excess---excess%1:07:02:: of **f as measured by the authors---author%1:18:00:: - the exact value---value%1:09:00:: depending on the arc---arc%1:19:00:: atmosphere---atmosphere%1:23:00:: .
In plasma generators---generator%1:06:01:: as currently commercially available for industrial use---use%1:07:00:: or as high temperature---high_temperature%1:07:00:: research---research%1:09:00:: tools---tool%1:06:00:: often more than 50 % of the total energy---energy%1:19:00:: input---input%1:10:00:: is being transferred to the cooling---cooling%1:22:00:: medium---medium%1:15:01:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: .
The higher heat---heat%1:19:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: at the anode---anode%1:06:00:: compared with those at the cathode---cathode%1:06:00:: can be explained by the physical phenomena---physical_phenomenon%1:19:00:: occurring in free burning arcs---arc%1:19:00:: .
In plasma generators---generator%1:06:01:: the superimposed forced convection---convection%1:22:01:: may modify the picture---picture%1:26:00:: somewhat .
The heat---heat%1:19:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: is due to the following effects---effect%1:19:00:: : 1 .
Heat of condensation---heat_of_condensation%1:19:00:: ( work---work%1:19:00:: function---function%1:24:00:: ) plus kinetic energy---kinetic_energy%1:19:00:: of the electrons---electron%1:17:00:: impinging on the anode---anode%1:06:00:: .
This energy---energy%1:19:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: depends on the current---current%1:19:01:: , the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: in the arc---arc%1:19:00:: column---column%1:06:02:: , the anode---anode%1:06:00:: material---material%1:27:00:: , and the conditions---condition%1:26:00:: in the anode---anode%1:06:00:: sheath---sheath%1:06:00:: .
Heat---heat%1:19:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: by molecular conduction---conduction%1:19:00:: as well as by radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: from the arc---arc%1:19:00:: column---column%1:06:02:: .
The heat---heat%1:19:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: in free burning arcs---arc%1:19:00:: is enhanced by a hot gas jet---gas_jet%1:06:00:: flowing from the cathode---cathode%1:06:00:: towards the anode---anode%1:06:00:: with velocities---velocity%1:28:00:: up **f .
This phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: has been experimentally investigated in detail by Maecker---person%1:03:00:: ( Ref.---reference%1:10:03:: 1 ) .
The pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: producing the jet---gas_jet%1:06:00:: is due to the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of the magnetic field---magnetic_field%1:19:00:: in the arc---arc%1:19:00:: ( rapid decrease---decrease%1:11:00:: of current---current%1:19:01:: density---density%1:07:00:: from cathode---cathode%1:06:00:: to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: ) .
Hence , the flow---flow%1:11:00:: conditions---condition%1:26:00:: at the anode---anode%1:06:00:: of free burning arcs---arc%1:19:00:: resemble those near a stagnation---stagnation%1:26:00:: point---point%1:26:00:: .
it is apparent from the above and from experimental evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that the cooling---cooling%1:22:00:: requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: for the anode---anode%1:06:00:: of free burning arcs---arc%1:19:00:: are large compared with those for the cathode---cathode%1:06:00:: .
The gas---gas%1:27:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: through a plasma generator---generator%1:06:01:: will modify these conditions---condition%1:26:00:: ; however , the anode---anode%1:06:00:: is still the part---part%1:06:00:: receiving the largest heat---heat%1:19:00:: flux---flux%1:11:00:: .
An attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to improve the life---life%1:28:00:: of the anodes---anode%1:06:00:: or the efficiency---efficiency%1:24:00:: of the plasma generators---generator%1:06:01:: must , therefore , aim at a reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: loss---loss%1:22:00:: .
The following possibilities---possibility%1:09:01:: exist for achieving this : 1 .
The use---use%1:04:00:: of high voltages---voltage%1:19:02:: and low currents---current%1:19:01:: by proper design---design%1:04:00:: to reduce electron---electron%1:17:00:: heat---heat%1:19:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: for a given power---power%1:19:00:: output---output%1:06:00:: .
Continuous motion---motion%1:26:00:: of the arc---arc%1:19:00:: contact---contact%1:04:00:: area---area%1:06:00:: at the anode---anode%1:06:00:: by flow---flow%1:11:00:: or magnetic forces---magnetic_force%1:19:00:: .
Feed back---feedback%1:22:00:: of the energy---energy%1:19:00:: transferred to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: by applying gas---gas%1:27:00:: transpiration---transpiration%1:22:01:: through the anode---anode%1:06:00:: .
The third method---method%1:09:00:: was , to our knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: , successfully applied for the first time by C. Sheer---person%1:03:00:: and co-workers---co-worker%1:18:00:: ( Ref.---reference%1:10:03:: 2 ) .
The purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of the present study---study%1:04:00:: is to study the thermal conditions---condition%1:26:00:: and to establish an energy---energy%1:19:00:: balance---balance%1:26:00:: for a transpiration---transpiration%1:22:01:: cooled anode---anode%1:06:00:: as well as the effect---effect%1:19:00:: of blowing---blowing%1:22:00:: on the arc---arc%1:19:00:: voltage---voltage%1:19:02:: .
Gas---gas%1:26:00:: injection---injection%1:04:00:: through a porous anode---anode%1:06:00:: ( transpiration---transpiration%1:22:01:: cooling---cooling%1:22:00:: ) not only feeds back the energy---energy%1:19:00:: transferred to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: by the above mentioned processes---process%1:04:00:: , but also modifies the conditions---condition%1:26:00:: in the arc---arc%1:19:00:: itself .
A detailed study---study%1:04:00:: of this latter phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: was not attempted in this paper---paper%1:10:01:: .
Argon---argon%1:27:00:: was used as a blowing gas---blowing_gas%1:27:00:: to exclude any effects---effect%1:19:00:: of dissociation---dissociation%1:04:00:: or chemical reaction---chemical_reaction%1:22:00:: .
The anode---anode%1:06:00:: material---material%1:27:00:: was porous graphite---graphite%1:27:00:: .
Sintered porous metals---metal%1:27:00:: should be usable in principle .
However , technical difficulties---difficulty%1:26:00:: arise by melting---melting%1:22:00:: at local hot spots---spot%1:15:01:: .
The experimental arrangement---arrangement%1:14:00:: as described below is based on the geometry---geometry%1:09:00:: of free burning arcs---arc%1:19:00:: .
Thus , direct comparisons---comparison%1:24:00:: can be drawn with free burning arcs---arc%1:19:00:: which have been studied in detail during the past years---year%1:28:01:: and decades---decade%1:28:00:: by numerous investigators---investigator%1:18:01:: ( Ref.---reference%1:10:03:: 3 ) .
Figures---figure%1:10:00:: 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic views---view%1:06:00:: of the test stand---stand%1:06:03:: and of two different models---model%1:09:03:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: .
The cathode---cathode%1:06:00:: consisted of a 1/4 '' diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: thoriated tungsten---tungsten%1:27:00:: rod---rod%1:06:00:: attached to a water cooled copper---copper%1:27:00:: tube---tube%1:06:02:: .
This tube could be adjusted in its axial direction---direction%1:15:00:: by an electric drive to establish the required electrode spacing .
This tube---tube%1:06:02:: could be adjusted in its axial direction---direction%1:24:00:: by an electric drive---drive%1:06:02:: to establish the required electrode---electrode%1:06:00:: spacing---spacing%1:07:00:: .
The anode---anode%1:06:00:: in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 was mounted by means---means%1:04:00:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: which was attached to a steel---steel%1:27:00:: plug---plug%1:06:00:: and disk---disk%1:06:00:: .
The transpiring gas---gas%1:27:00:: ejected from the anode---anode%1:06:00:: formed a jet---jet%1:11:00:: directed axially towards the cathode---cathode%1:06:00:: below .
Inflow---inflow%1:22:00:: of air---air%1:27:00:: from the surrounding atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:00:: was prevented by the two disks---disk%1:06:00:: shown in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 .
Argon---argon%1:27:00:: was also blown at low velocities---velocity%1:28:00:: ( mass---mass%1:07:00:: flow rate---flow_rate%1:28:00:: **f ) through a tube---tube%1:06:02:: coaxial with the cathode---cathode%1:06:00:: as an additional precaution---precaution%1:04:00:: against contamination---contamination%1:26:00:: of the arc---arc%1:19:00:: by air---air%1:27:00:: .
The anode---anode%1:06:00:: consisted of a 1/2 inch---inch%1:23:00:: diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: porous graphite---graphite%1:27:00:: plug---plug%1:06:00:: , 1/4 inch---inch%1:23:00:: long .
The graphite---graphite%1:27:00:: was National Carbon NC 60 , which has a porosity---porosity%1:07:00:: of 50 % and an average pore---pore%1:25:00:: size---size%1:07:00:: of 30---30%1:23:00:: This small pore---pore%1:25:00:: size---size%1:07:00:: was required to ensure uniformity---uniformity%1:07:01:: of the flow---flow%1:11:00:: leaving the anode---anode%1:06:00:: .
The anode---anode%1:06:00:: plug---plug%1:06:00:: ( Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 ) was inserted into a carbon---carbon%1:27:00:: anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: .
A shielded thermocouple---thermocouple%1:06:00:: was used to measure the upstream temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of the transpiring gas---gas%1:27:00:: .
It was exposed to a high velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: gas jet---gas_jet%1:06:00:: .
A plug---plug%1:06:00:: and a tube---tube%1:06:02:: with holes---hole%1:06:00:: in its cylindrical walls---wall%1:06:00:: divided the chamber---chamber%1:06:00:: above the porous plug---plug%1:06:00:: into two parts---part%1:24:00:: .
This arrangement---arrangement%1:14:00:: had the purpose---purpose%1:07:00:: to prevent heated gas---gas%1:27:00:: to reach the thermocouple---thermocouple%1:06:00:: by natural convection---convection%1:22:01:: .
Two pyrometers---pyrometer%1:06:00:: shown in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 1 and 2 ( Pyrometer Instrument Co.---group%1:03:00:: Model---model%1:09:03:: 95 ) served for simultaneous measurement---measurement%1:04:00:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: surface---surface%1:06:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: and the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: along the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: .
Three thermocouples---thermocouple%1:06:00:: were placed at different locations---location%1:03:00:: in the aluminum---aluminum%1:27:00:: disk---disk%1:06:00:: surrounding the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: to determine its temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: .
Another anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: used in the experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: is shown in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 .
In this design---design%1:09:01:: the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: is water cooled and the heat---heat%1:19:00:: losses---loss%1:22:00:: by conduction---conduction%1:19:00:: from the anode---anode%1:06:00:: were determined by measuring the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: rise---rise%1:11:00:: of the coolant---coolant%1:27:00:: .
To reduce heat---heat%1:19:00:: transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: from the hot gas---gas%1:27:00:: to this anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: outside the region---region%1:15:00:: of the arc---arc%1:19:00:: , a carbon---carbon%1:27:00:: shield---shield%1:06:02:: was attached to the surface---surface%1:06:00:: providing an air---air%1:27:00:: gap---gap%1:06:00:: of 1/16 inch---inch%1:23:00:: between the plate---plate%1:06:02:: and the surface---surface%1:06:00:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: .
In addition , the inner surface---surface%1:06:00:: of the carbon---carbon%1:27:00:: shield---shield%1:06:02:: was covered with aluminum foil---aluminum_foil%1:06:00:: to reduce radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: .
Temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: of the shield---shield%1:06:02:: and of the surface---surface%1:06:00:: of the water cooled anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: were measured by thermocouples---thermocouple%1:06:00:: to account for heat---heat%1:19:00:: received by the coolant---coolant%1:27:00:: but not originating from the anode---anode%1:06:00:: plug---plug%1:06:00:: .
The argon---argon%1:27:00:: flow---flow%1:28:00:: from commercial bottles---bottle%1:06:00:: was regulated by a pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: regulator---regulator%1:06:00:: and measured with a gas---gas%1:27:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: rator .
The power---power%1:19:00:: source---source%1:15:00:: was a commercial D.C.---direct_current%1:19:00:: rectifier---rectifier%1:06:00:: .
At 100 Amp---amp%1:23:00:: the 360 cycle---cycle%1:28:02:: ripple---ripple%1:11:01:: was less than 0.5 V---v%1:23:00:: ( peak---peak%1:23:00:: to peak---peak%1:23:00:: ) with a resistive load---load%1:19:01:: .
The current---current%1:19:01:: was regulated by means of a variable resistor---variable_resistor%1:06:00:: and measured with a 50 mV---mv%1:23:00:: shunt---shunt%1:06:01:: and millivoltmeter---millivoltmeter%1:06:00:: .
The arc---arc%1:19:00:: voltage---voltage%1:19:02:: was measured with a voltmeter---voltmeter%1:06:00:: whose terminals---terminal%1:06:01:: were connected to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: and cathode---cathode%1:06:00:: holders---holder%1:06:00:: .
Because of the falling characteristic---characteristic%1:09:00:: of the rectifier---rectifier%1:06:00:: , no ballast resistor---ballast_resistor%1:06:00:: was required for stability---stability%1:07:00:: of operation .
A high frequency---high_frequency%1:07:01:: starter---starter%1:06:02:: was used to start the arc---arc%1:19:00:: .
The anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: shown in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 was designed with two goals---goal%1:09:00:: in mind---mind%1:09:01:: .
The heat---heat%1:19:00:: losses---loss%1:22:00:: of the holder---holder%1:06:00:: were to be reduced as far as possible and they should be such that an accurate heat---heat%1:19:00:: balance---balance%1:26:00:: can be made .
In order to reduce the number---number%1:07:00:: of variable parameters---parameter%1:09:00:: , all experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: were made with a constant arc---arc%1:19:00:: length---length%1:07:00:: of 0.5 '' and a current---current%1:19:01:: of 100 Amp---amp%1:23:00:: .
The argon---argon%1:27:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: through the porous anode---anode%1:06:00:: was varied systematically between **f .
The lower limit---lower_limit%1:23:00:: was determined by the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that for smaller flow rates---flow_rate%1:28:00:: the arc---arc%1:19:00:: started to strike to the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: instead of to the porous graphite---graphite%1:27:00:: plug---plug%1:06:00:: and that it became highly unstable .
The upper limit---upper_limit%1:23:00:: was determined by the difficulty---difficulty%1:07:00:: of measuring the characteristic anode---anode%1:06:00:: surface---surface%1:06:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: ( see below ) since only a small region---region%1:15:00:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: was struck by the arc---arc%1:19:00:: .
This region---region%1:15:00:: which had a higher temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: than the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: surface---surface%1:06:00:: changed size---size%1:07:00:: and location---location%1:03:00:: continuously .
For each mass---mass%1:07:00:: flow rate---flow_rate%1:28:00:: the arc---arc%1:19:00:: voltage---voltage%1:19:02:: was measured .
To measure the surface---surface%1:06:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: plug---plug%1:06:00:: , the surface---surface%1:06:00:: was scanned with a pyrometer---pyrometer%1:06:00:: .
As it turned out , a very hot region---region%1:15:00:: occurred on the plug---plug%1:06:00:: .
Its temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: was denoted by **f .
The size---size%1:07:00:: of this hot region---region%1:15:00:: was estimated by eye---eye%1:08:00:: .
The rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the surface---surface%1:06:00:: had a temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: which decreased towards the outer diameter---diameter%1:25:00:: of the plug---plug%1:06:00:: .
The mean temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of this region---region%1:15:00:: was approximated by the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: measured halfways between the edge---edge%1:15:00:: of the hot spot---spot%1:15:01:: and the rim---rim%1:25:00:: of the plug---plug%1:06:00:: .
The mean temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of the surface---surface%1:06:00:: was then computed according to the following relation---relation%1:03:00:: : **f where x is the fraction---fraction%1:06:00:: of the plug---plug%1:06:00:: area---area%1:07:00:: covered by the hot spot---spot%1:15:01:: .
Assuming thermal equilibrium---equilibrium%1:26:00:: between the anode---anode%1:06:00:: surface---surface%1:06:00:: and the transpiring argon---argon%1:27:00:: , the gas---gas%1:27:00:: enthalpy---enthalpy%1:07:00:: rise---rise%1:11:00:: through the anode---anode%1:06:00:: was calculated according to the relation---relation%1:03:00:: **f whereby the specific heat---specific_heat%1:19:00:: of argon---argon%1:27:00:: was taken as **f .
This calculation---calculation%1:04:00:: results in an enthalpy---enthalpy%1:07:00:: rise---rise%1:11:00:: which is somewhat high because it assumes a mass---mass%1:07:00:: flow---flow%1:11:00:: equally distributed over the plug---plug%1:06:00:: cross section---cross_section%1:15:00:: whereas in reality the mass---mass%1:07:00:: velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: is expected to be smaller in the regions---region%1:15:00:: of higher temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: .
The upstream gas---gas%1:27:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: measured with the thermocouple---thermocouple%1:06:00:: shown in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 was **f .
The **f values---value%1:09:00:: are listed in Table---table%1:14:00:: 1 together with the measured surface---surface%1:06:00:: temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: and arc---arc%1:19:00:: voltages---voltage%1:19:02:: .
Simultaneously with the anode---anode%1:06:00:: surface---surface%1:06:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: and voltage---voltage%1:19:02:: measurements---measurement%1:04:00:: pyrometer---pyrometer%1:06:00:: readings---reading%1:09:02:: were taken along the cylindrical surface---surface%1:06:00:: of the carbon---carbon%1:27:00:: anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: as indicated on figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 .
Some of these temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: are plotted in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 4 .
They showed no marked dependence---dependence%1:26:00:: on the flow rate---flow_rate%1:28:00:: within the accuracy---accuracy%1:07:03:: of these measurements .
Thus , the dotted line---line%1:10:01:: shown in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 4 was taken as typical for the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: for all blowing---blowing%1:22:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: .
The thermocouples---thermocouple%1:06:00:: in the aluminum---aluminum%1:27:00:: disk---disk%1:06:00:: shown in figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 indicated an equilibrium---equilibrium%1:26:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of the surface---surface%1:06:00:: of **f .
This temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: was taken as environmental temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: to which the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: was exposed as far as radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: is concerned .
It is sufficiently small compared with the surface---surface%1:06:00:: temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: , to make the energy---energy%1:19:00:: flux---flux%1:11:00:: radiated from the environment---environment%1:26:00:: toward the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: negligible within the accuracy---accuracy%1:07:03:: of the present measurements .
The reflection---reflection%1:19:00:: of radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: originating from the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: and reflected back to it by the surrounding metal---metal%1:27:00:: surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: should also be small because of the specular characteristic---characteristic%1:09:00:: of the metal---metal%1:27:00:: surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: and of the specific geometry---geometry%1:09:00:: .
The total heat---heat%1:19:00:: loss---loss%1:22:00:: through the anode---anode%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: included also the heat---heat%1:19:00:: conducted through the base---base%1:06:01:: of the cylindrical piece---piece%1:06:00:: into the adjacent metal---metal%1:27:00:: parts---part%1:06:00:: .
It was calculated from the temperature gradient---temperature_gradient%1:24:00:: **f at **f inch---inch%1:23:00:: as **f .
The total heat---heat%1:19:00:: flux---flux%1:11:00:: from the porous plug---plug%1:06:00:: into the plug---plug%1:06:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: is thereby **f The temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: of figure---figure%1:10:00:: 4 gives **f for all blowing---blowing%1:22:00:: rates---rate%1:28:00:: , assuming **f .
The temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: dependent value---value%1:09:00:: of |e was taken from Ref.---reference%1:10:03:: 7 .
The radiation---radiation%1:19:00:: loss---loss%1:22:00:: from the anode---anode%1:06:00:: surface---surface%1:06:00:: was computed according to **f where **f is the mean---mean%1:09:00:: of the fourth powers---power%1:10:00:: of the temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: **f and **f calculated analogously to equation---equation%1:10:00:: ( 1 ) .
Standing in the shelter---shelter%1:06:01:: of the tent---tent%1:06:00:: - a rejected hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: tent---tent%1:06:00:: on which the rain---rain%1:19:00:: now dripped , no longer drumming - Adam---person%1:03:00:: watched his own hands---hand%1:08:00:: touch the objects---object%1:03:00:: on the improvised counter---counter%1:06:04:: of boards---board%1:27:00:: laid across two beef---beef%1:13:00:: barrels---barrel%1:06:00:: .
There was , of course , no real need---need%1:26:00:: to rearrange everything .
A quarter---quarter%1:23:01:: inch---inch%1:23:00:: this way---way%1:15:00:: or that for the hardbake---hardbake%1:13:00:: , or the toffee---toffee%1:13:00:: , or the barley---barley%1:13:00:: sugar---sugar%1:13:00:: , or the sardines---sardine%1:13:00:: , or the bitters---bitters%1:13:00:: , or the condensed milk---condensed_milk%1:13:00:: , or the stationery---stationery%1:10:00:: , or the needles---needle%1:06:00:: - what could it mean ?
Adam---person%1:03:00:: watched his own hands---hand%1:08:00:: make the caressing---caress%1:04:00:: , anxious movement---movement%1:11:00:: that , when rain---rain%1:19:00:: falls and nobody comes , and ruin---ruin%1:26:00:: draws close like a cat---cat%1:05:00:: rubbing against the ankles---ankle%1:08:00:: , has been the ritual---ritual%1:04:01:: of stall---stall%1:06:01:: vendors---vendor%1:18:00:: , forever .
He recognized the gesture---gesture%1:04:00:: .
He knew its meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: .
He had seen a dry , old , yellowing hand---hand%1:08:00:: reach out , with that painful solicitude---solicitude%1:12:00:: , to touch , to rearrange , to shift aimlessly , some object---object%1:03:00:: worth a pfennig---pfennig%1:23:00:: .
Back in Bavaria---bavaria%1:15:00:: he had seen that gesture---gesture%1:04:00:: , and at that sight---sight%1:09:00:: his heart---heart%1:09:00:: had always died within him .
On such occasions---occasion%1:11:00:: he had not had the courage---courage%1:07:00:: to look at the face---face%1:08:00:: above the hand---hand%1:08:00:: , whatever face---face%1:08:00:: it might be .
Now the face---face%1:08:00:: was his own .
He wondered what expression---expression%1:07:00:: , as he made that gesture---gesture%1:04:00:: , was on his face---face%1:08:00:: .
He wondered if it wore the old anxiety---anxiety%1:12:00:: , or the old , taut stoicism---stoicism%1:07:00:: .
But there was no need---need%1:26:00:: , he remembered , for his hand---hand%1:08:00:: to reach out , for his face---face%1:08:00:: to show concern---concern%1:12:01:: or stoicism---stoicism%1:07:00:: .
It was nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to him if rain---rain%1:19:00:: fell and nobody came .
Then why was he assuming the role---role%1:04:00:: - the gesture---gesture%1:04:00:: and the suffering---suffering%1:26:01:: ?
Or was he now taking the role---role%1:04:00:: - the gesture---gesture%1:04:00:: and the suffering---suffering%1:26:01:: - because it was the only way---way%1:04:01:: to affirm his history---history%1:28:00:: and identity---identity%1:07:00:: in the torpid , befogged loneliness---loneliness%1:26:00:: of this land---land%1:15:02:: .
This was Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: .
He looked out of the tent---tent%1:06:00:: at the company---company%1:14:03:: street---street%1:06:00:: .
The rain---rain%1:19:00:: dripped on the freezing loblolly---loblolly%1:13:00:: of the street---street%1:06:00:: .
Beyond that misty gray---gray%1:07:00:: of the rain---rain%1:19:00:: , he saw the stretching hutment---hutment%1:06:00:: , low diminutive log cabins---log_cabin%1:06:00:: , chinked with mud---mud%1:27:00:: , with doorways---doorway%1:06:00:: a man---man%1:18:00:: would have to crouch to get through , with roofs---roof%1:06:00:: of tenting---tenting%1:04:00:: laid over boughs---bough%1:20:00:: or boards---board%1:27:00:: from hardtack---hardtack%1:13:00:: boxes---box%1:06:00:: , or fence rails---fence_rail%1:06:00:: , with cranky chimneys---chimney%1:06:00:: of sticks---stick%1:20:00:: and dried mud---mud%1:27:00:: .
The chimney---chimney%1:06:00:: of the hut---hut%1:06:01:: across from him was surmounted by a beef---beef%1:13:00:: barrel---barrel%1:06:00:: with ends---end%1:15:02:: knocked out .
In this heavy air---air%1:27:00:: , however , that device---device%1:06:00:: did not seem to help .
The smoke---smoke%1:19:00:: from that chimney---chimney%1:06:00:: rose as sluggishly as smoke---smoke%1:19:00:: from any other , and hung as sadly in the drizzle---drizzle%1:19:00:: , creeping back down along the sopping canvas---canvas%1:06:02:: of the roof---roof%1:06:00:: .
Over the door---door%1:06:00:: was a board---board%1:27:00:: with large , inept lettering---lettering%1:10:00:: :
This was the hut---hut%1:06:01:: of Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: , the hero---hero%1:18:00:: .
The men---man%1:18:00:: were huddled in those lairs---lair%1:15:00:: .
Adam---person%1:03:00:: knew the names---name%1:10:00:: of some .
He knew the faces---face%1:08:00:: of all , hairy or shaven , old or young , fat or thin , suffering---suffering%1:26:01:: or hardened , sad or gay , good or bad .
When they stood about his tent---tent%1:06:00:: , chaffing each other , exchanging their obscenities---obscenity%1:07:00:: , cursing command---command%1:10:00:: or weather---weather%1:19:00:: , he had studied their faces---face%1:08:00:: .
He had had the need---need%1:03:00:: to understand what life---life%1:26:00:: lurked behind the mask---mask%1:06:00:: of flesh---flesh%1:08:02:: , behind the oath---oath%1:10:01:: , the banter---banter%1:10:00:: , the sadness---sadness%1:12:00:: .
Once covertly looking at Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: , the only man---man%1:18:00:: in the world---world%1:17:01:: whom he hated , he had seen the heavy , slack , bestubbled jaw---jaw%1:08:00:: open and close to emit the cruel , obscene banter---banter%1:10:00:: , and had seen the pale blue eyes---eye%1:08:00:: go watery with whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: and merriment---merriment%1:12:00:: , and suddenly he was not seeing the face---face%1:08:00:: of that vile creature---creature%1:03:00:: .
He was seeing , somehow , the face---face%1:08:00:: of a young boy---boy%1:18:00:: , the boy---boy%1:18:00:: Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: must once have been , a boy---boy%1:18:00:: with sorrel hair---hair%1:08:00:: , and blue eyes---eye%1:08:00:: dancing with gaiety---gaiety%1:12:00:: , and the boy---boy%1:18:00:: mouth---mouth%1:08:00:: grinning---grinning%1:10:00:: trustfully among the freckles---freckle%1:08:00:: .
In that moment---moment%1:28:00:: of vision---vision%1:09:03:: Adam---person%1:03:00:: heard the voice---voice%1:10:00:: within himself saying : I must not hate him , I must not hate him or I shall die .
His heart---heart%1:09:00:: suddenly opened to joy---joy%1:12:00:: .
He thought that if once , only once , he could talk with Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: , something about his own life---life%1:09:00:: , and all life---life%1:09:00:: , would be clear and simple .
If Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: would turn to him and say : `` Adam---person%1:03:00:: , you know when I was a boy---boy%1:18:00:: , it was a funny thing---thing%1:11:00:: happened .
If only Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: could do that , whatever the thing---thing%1:11:00:: he remembered and told .
It would be a sign---sign%1:10:03:: for the untellable , and he , Adam---person%1:03:00:: , would understand .
Now , Adam---person%1:03:00:: , in the gray---gray%1:07:00:: light---light%1:07:01:: of afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: , stared across at the hut---hut%1:06:01:: opposite his tent---tent%1:06:00:: , and thought of Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: lying in there in the gloom---gloom%1:26:01:: , snoring on his bunk---bunk%1:06:00:: , with the fumes---fumes%1:27:00:: of whisky---whisky%1:13:00:: choking the air---air%1:27:00:: .
He saw the sign---sign%1:10:00:: above the door---door%1:06:00:: of the hut---hut%1:06:01:: : Home Sweet Home .
He saw the figure---figure%1:08:00:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: in a poncho---poncho%1:06:00:: coming up the company---company%1:14:03:: street---street%1:06:00:: , with an armful---armful%1:23:00:: of wood---wood%1:27:00:: .
It was Pullen James---person%1:03:00:: , the campmate---campmate%1:18:00:: of Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: .
He carried the wood---wood%1:27:00:: , carried the water---water%1:27:00:: , did the cooking , cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: and mending , and occasionally got a kick in the butt---kick_in_the_butt%1:04:00:: for his pains---pains%1:04:00:: .
Adam---person%1:03:00:: watched the moisture---moisture%1:26:00:: flow from the poncho---poncho%1:06:00:: .
It gave the rubberized fabric---fabric%1:06:00:: a dull gleam---gleam%1:07:00:: , like metal---metal%1:27:00:: .
Pullen James---person%1:03:00:: humbly lowered his head---head%1:08:00:: , pushed aside the hardtack---hardtack%1:27:00:: box---box%1:06:00:: door---door%1:06:00:: of the hut---hut%1:06:01:: , and was gone from sight---sight%1:09:00:: .
Adam---person%1:03:00:: stared at the door---door%1:06:00:: and remembered that Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: had been awarded the Medal of Honor---medal_of_honor%1:10:00:: for gallantry---gallantry%1:07:00:: at Antietam---location%1:03:00:: .
The street---street%1:06:00:: was again empty .
The drizzle---drizzle%1:19:00:: was slacking off now , but the light---light%1:19:00:: was grayer .
With enormous interest---interest%1:09:00:: , Adam---person%1:03:00:: watched his hands---hand%1:08:00:: as they touched and shifted the objects---object%1:03:00:: on the board---board%1:27:00:: directly before him .
Into the emptiness---emptiness%1:26:00:: of the street---street%1:06:00:: , and his spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: , moved a form---form%1:08:00:: .
The form---form%1:08:00:: was swathed in an army---army%1:14:00:: blanket---blanket%1:06:00:: , much patched , fastened at the neck---neck%1:08:00:: with a cord---cord%1:06:00:: .
From under the shapeless huddle---huddle%1:10:00:: of blanket---blanket%1:06:00:: the feet---foot%1:08:01:: moved in the mud---mud%1:27:00:: .
The feet---foot%1:08:01:: wore army---army%1:14:00:: shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: , in obvious disrepair---disrepair%1:26:00:: .
The head---head%1:08:00:: was wrapped in a turban---turban%1:06:00:: and on top---top%1:15:01:: of the turban---turban%1:06:00:: rode a great hamper---hamper%1:06:01:: across which a piece---piece%1:06:00:: of poncho---poncho%1:06:00:: had been flung .
The gray---gray%1:07:00:: face---face%1:08:00:: stared straight ahead in the drizzle---drizzle%1:19:00:: .
Moisture---moisture%1:26:00:: ran down the cheeks---cheek%1:08:00:: , gathered at the tip---tip%1:15:00:: of the nose---nose%1:08:00:: , and at the chin---chin%1:08:00:: .
The figure---figure%1:08:00:: was close enough now for him to see the nose---nose%1:08:00:: twitching to dislodge the drop---drop%1:23:00:: clinging there .
The figure---figure%1:08:00:: stopped and one hand---hand%1:08:00:: was perilously freed from the hamper---hamper%1:06:01:: to scratch the nose---nose%1:08:00:: .
Then the figure---figure%1:08:00:: moved on .
This was one of the Irish women---woman%1:18:00:: who had built their own huts---hut%1:06:00:: down near the river---river%1:17:00:: .
Adam---person%1:03:00:: recognized this one .
He recognized her because she was the one who , in a winter---winter%1:28:00:: twilight , on the edge---edge%1:15:00:: of camp---camp%1:06:00:: , had once stopped him and reached down her hand---hand%1:08:00:: to touch his fly---fly%1:06:00:: .
`` Slice---slice%1:13:00:: o ' mutton---mutton%1:13:00:: , bhoy '' ? she had queried in her soft guttural .
`` Slice---slice%1:13:00:: o ' mutton---mutton%1:13:00:: '' ?
Her name---name%1:10:00:: was Mollie---person%1:03:00:: .
They called her Mollie the Mutton---person%1:03:00:: , and laughed .
Looking down the street---street%1:06:00:: after her , Adam---person%1:03:00:: saw that she had again stopped and again removed one hand---hand%1:08:00:: from the basket---basket%1:06:00:: .
He could not make out , but he knew that again she was scratching her nose---nose%1:08:00:: .
Mollie the Mutton---person%1:03:00:: was scratching her nose---nose%1:08:00:: .
The words---word%1:10:00:: ran crazily in his head---head%1:08:00:: : Mollie the Mutton---person%1:03:00:: is scratching her nose---nose%1:08:00:: in the rain---rain%1:19:00:: .
Then the words---word%1:10:00:: fell into a pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: : `` Mollie the Mutton---person%1:03:00:: is scratching her nose---nose%1:08:00:: , Scratching her nose---nose%1:08:00:: in the rain---rain%1:19:00:: .
Mollie the Mutton---person%1:03:00:: is scratching her nose---nose%1:08:00:: in the rain---rain%1:19:00:: '' .
The pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: would not stop .
He felt trapped in that pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: , in the repetition---repetition%1:04:00:: .
He looked wildly around , at the now empty street---street%1:06:00:: , at the mud---mud%1:27:00:: , at the rain---rain%1:19:00:: .
When he had stored his stock---stock%1:06:00:: in the great oak---oak%1:20:02:: chest---chest%1:06:00:: , locked the two big hasps---hasp%1:06:00:: and secured the additional chain---chain%1:06:00:: , tied the fly---fly%1:06:01:: of the tent---tent%1:06:00:: , and picked up the cash---cash%1:21:00:: box---box%1:06:00:: , he moved up the darkening street---street%1:06:00:: .
He would consign the cash---cash%1:21:00:: box---box%1:06:00:: into the hands---hand%1:08:00:: of Jed Hawksworth---person%1:03:00:: , then stand by while his employer---employer%1:18:00:: checked the contents---content%1:14:00:: and the list---list%1:10:00:: of items---item%1:06:00:: sold .
His mind---mind%1:09:00:: closed on that prospect---prospect%1:26:00:: , as though fog---fog%1:19:00:: had descended to blot out a valley---valley%1:17:00:: .
Far off , in the dusk , he heard voices---voice%1:10:00:: singing , muffled but strong .
In one of the huts---hut%1:06:00:: a group---group%1:03:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: were huddled together , singing .
He heard the words---word%1:10:00:: : `` Rock of Ages , cleft for me , Let me hide myself in Thee !
Let the water---water%1:27:00:: and the blood---blood%1:08:00:: From Thy riven side---side%1:15:00:: '' .
He thought : I am a Jew---jew%1:18:00:: from Bavaria---bavaria%1:15:00:: .
He was standing there , he thought , in Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: , in the thickening dusk , in a costly greatcoat---greatcoat%1:06:00:: that had belonged to another Jew---jew%1:18:00:: .
That other Jew---jew%1:18:00:: , a young man---young_man%1:18:00:: too , had left that greatcoat---greatcoat%1:06:00:: behind , in a rich house---house%1:06:00:: , and marched away .
He had crossed the river---river%1:17:00:: which now , beyond the woods---woods%1:14:00:: yonder , was sliding darkly under the mist---mist%1:19:00:: .
He had plunged into the dark woods---woods%1:14:00:: beyond .
What had that man---man%1:18:00:: , that other young Jew---jew%1:18:00:: , felt as he stood in the twilight and heard other men---man%1:18:00:: , far away , singing together ?
Adam---person%1:03:00:: thought of the hutments---hutment%1:06:00:: , regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: after regiment---regiment%1:14:00:: , row---row%1:14:00:: after row---row%1:14:00:: , the thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of huts---hut%1:06:01:: , stretching away into the night---night%1:28:00:: .
He thought of the men---man%1:18:03:: , the nameless thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: , huddling in them .
He thought of Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: snoring on his bunk---bunk%1:06:00:: while Pullen James---person%1:03:00:: crouched by the hearth---hearth%1:06:01:: , skirmishing an undershirt---undershirt%1:06:00:: for lice---louse%1:05:01:: , and a wet log sizzled .
He thought of Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: , who once had risen at the edge---edge%1:15:00:: of a cornfield---cornfield%1:15:00:: , a maniacal scream---scream%1:10:00:: on his lips---lip%1:08:00:: , and swung a clubbed musket---musket%1:06:00:: like a flail---flail%1:06:00:: to beat down the swirl---swirl%1:25:00:: of Rebel bayonets---bayonet%1:06:00:: about him .
He thought of Simms Purdew---person%1:03:00:: rising up , fearless in glory---glory%1:26:00:: .
He felt the sweetness---sweetness%1:09:00:: of pity---pity%1:12:00:: flood---flood%1:04:00:: through him , veining his very flesh---flesh%1:08:02:: .
Those men---man%1:18:03:: , lying in the huts---hut%1:06:01:: , they did not know .
They did not know who they were or know their own worth---worth%1:07:00:: .
In the pity---pity%1:12:00:: for them his loneliness---loneliness%1:26:00:: was gone .
Then he thought of Aaron Blaustein---person%1:03:00:: standing in his rich house---house%1:06:00:: saying : `` God---god%1:18:01:: is tired of taking the blame---blame%1:10:00:: .
He is going to let History---history%1:28:00:: take the blame---blame%1:10:00:: for a while '' .
He thought of the old man---old_man%1:18:02:: laughing under the glitter---glitter%1:07:00:: of the great chandelier---chandelier%1:06:00:: .
He thought : Only in my heart---heart%1:09:00:: can I make the world---world%1:17:01:: hang together .
Adam---person%1:03:00:: rose from the crouch---crouch%1:04:00:: necessary to enter the hut---hut%1:06:01:: .
He saw Mose---person%1:03:00:: squatting by the hearth---hearth%1:06:00:: , breaking up hardtack---hardtack%1:13:00:: into a pan---pan%1:06:01:: .
A pot---pot%1:06:00:: was boiling on the coals---coal%1:27:00:: .
`` Done give Ole Buckra---person%1:03:00:: all his money---money%1:21:00:: '' ?
Mose---person%1:03:00:: asked softly .
Adam---person%1:03:00:: nodded .
`` Yeah '' , Mose---person%1:03:00:: murmured , `` yeah .
Adam---person%1:03:00:: looked at the pot---pot%1:06:00:: .
`` Chicken---chicken%1:13:00:: '' , Mose---person%1:03:00:: said , and theatrically licked his lips---lip%1:08:00:: .
`` Gre't big fat chicken---chicken%1:13:00:: , yeah '' .
He licked his lips---lip%1:08:00:: again .
A chicken---chicken%1:13:00:: with six tits---tit%1:08:01:: and a tail---tail%1:08:01:: lak a corkscrew---corkscrew%1:06:00:: .
And hit squealed for slop---slop%1:13:00:: '' .
Mose---person%1:03:00:: giggled .
It is the same ole same , tell me hit 's name---name%1:10:00:: .
It is sowbelly---sowbelly%1:13:00:: with tits---tit%1:08:01:: on .
Had to put my foot---foot%1:08:01:: on it to hole it down while I cut it up fer the lob-scuse---lobscuse%1:13:00:: '' .
He dumped the pan---pan%1:06:01:: of crumbled hardtack---hardtack%1:13:00:: into the boiling pot---pot%1:06:00:: of lobscouse---lobscouse%1:13:00:: .
`` Good ole lob-scuse---lobscuse%1:13:00:: '' , he mumbled , and stirred the pot---pot%1:06:00:: .
He stopped stirring and looked over his shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
`` Know what Ole Buckra---person%1:03:00:: et tonight '' ? he demanded .
Adam---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
`` Chicken---chicken%1:13:00:: '' , Mose---person%1:03:00:: said .
The most beautiful bed---bed%1:06:01:: of pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: I 've seen was in a South Dakota---south_dakota%1:15:00:: yard---yard%1:06:02:: on a sizzling day---day%1:28:01:: .
Pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: are supposed to like it cool , but those great velvety flowers---flower%1:20:00:: were healthy and perky in the glaring sun---sun%1:19:00:: .
I sought out the gardener---gardener%1:18:00:: and asked him what he did to produce such beauties---beauty%1:09:00:: in that weather---weather%1:19:00:: .
He seemed puzzled by my question---question%1:10:00:: .
The more I talked with him , the more convinced I became that that was the secret---secret%1:10:00:: of their riotous blooming---blooming%1:22:00:: .
Of course his love---love%1:12:00:: was expressed in intelligent care---care%1:04:01:: .
He planted the pansy---pansy%1:20:01:: seeds---seed%1:20:00:: himself , buying them from a pansy---pansy%1:20:01:: specialist---specialist%1:18:00:: .
These specialists---specialist%1:18:00:: , I learned , have done a great deal---great_deal%1:23:00:: of work---work%1:09:00:: to improve the size---size%1:07:00:: and health---health%1:26:00:: of the plants---plant%1:03:00:: and the resulting flowers---flower%1:20:00:: .
Their seeds---seed%1:20:00:: produce vigorous blooming plants---plant%1:03:00:: half again the size---size%1:07:00:: of the unimproved strains---strain%1:14:01:: .
I asked him if he took seeds---seed%1:20:00:: from his own plants---plant%1:03:00:: .
Occasionally , when he had an unusual flower---flower%1:20:00:: that he wanted more of he did ; but pansy---pansy%1:20:01:: seeds---seed%1:20:00:: , he told me , soon `` run down '' .
It 's best to buy them fresh from a dealer---dealer%1:18:02:: who is working to improve them .
His soil---soil%1:27:01:: was `` nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: special '' , just prairie---prairie%1:15:00:: land---land%1:17:01:: , but he had harrowed in compost---compost%1:27:00:: until it was loose , spongy and brown black .
I fingered it and had the feeling---feeling%1:09:01:: of adequacy---adequacy%1:07:01:: that comes with the right texture---texture%1:07:00:: , tilth---tilth%1:26:00:: and body---body%1:07:00:: .
It is n't easy to describe it , but every gardener---gardener%1:18:00:: knows it when his fingers---finger%1:08:00:: touch such soil---soil%1:27:01:: .
Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: is easier to grow from seed---seed%1:20:00:: than pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: .
They germinate quickly , the tiny plants---plant%1:03:00:: appearing in a week---week%1:28:00:: , and grow along lustily .
It does n't really matter which month---month%1:28:01:: of the year---year%1:28:01:: you sow them , but they germinate best when they have a wide variation---variation%1:11:01:: of temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: , very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours---hour%1:28:00:: .
I like to make a seedbed---seedbed%1:06:00:: right in the open---open%1:15:02:: , though many people---people%1:14:00:: start them successfully in cold frames---cold_frame%1:06:00:: .
Pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: do n't have to be coddled ; they 'd rather have things---thing%1:09:02:: rugged , with only moderate protection---protection%1:06:00:: on the coldest days---day%1:28:01:: .
If you do use a cold frame---cold_frame%1:06:00:: be sure that its ventilation---ventilation%1:04:00:: is adequate .
For my seedbed---seedbed%1:06:00:: I use good garden---garden%1:06:00:: soil---soil%1:27:01:: with a little sand---sand%1:27:00:: added to encourage rooting---rooting%1:22:00:: .
I dig it , rake it smooth , sow the seeds---seed%1:20:00:: and wet them down with a fog---fog%1:19:00:: spray---spray%1:06:00:: .
Then I cover the sowing with a board---board%1:27:00:: .
This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds---bird%1:05:00:: .
Ants---ant%1:05:00:: carry away the seeds---seed%1:20:00:: so better be sure that there are no ant---ant%1:05:00:: hills---hill%1:17:00:: nearby .
When the first sprinkling---sprinkling%1:23:00:: of green---green%1:07:00:: appears I remove the board---board%1:27:00:: .
A light , porous mulch---mulch%1:06:00:: applied now keeps the roots---root%1:20:00:: cool and the soil---soil%1:27:01:: soft during these early days---day%1:28:01:: of growth---growth%1:22:00:: .
I like sawdust---sawdust%1:27:00:: for this , or hay---hay%1:13:00:: .
When they have 4 to 6 leaves---leaf%1:20:00:: and are thrifty little plants---plant%1:03:00:: , it 's time---time%1:28:06:: to set them out where they are to remain .
Every time---time%1:11:00:: you transplant a pansy---pansy%1:20:01:: you cause its flowers---flower%1:20:00:: to become smaller .
The moral---moral%1:10:00:: is : do n't transplant it any oftener than you must .
As soon as they are large enough to move , I put mine 9 inches---inch%1:23:02:: apart where they are to bloom .
I put a little scoop---scoop%1:23:00:: of pulverized phosphate---phosphate%1:27:00:: rock---rock%1:17:01:: or steamed bone meal---bonemeal%1:27:00:: into each hole---hole%1:17:01:: with the plant---plant%1:03:00:: .
That encourages rooting---rooting%1:22:00:: , and the better developed the roots---root%1:20:00:: , the larger and more plentiful the flowers---flower%1:20:00:: .
Pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: are gluttons---glutton%1:18:00:: .
I spade lots---lot%1:23:00:: of compost---compost%1:27:00:: into their bed---bed%1:06:01:: ; lacking that , decayed manure---manure%1:27:00:: spread over the bed---bed%1:06:01:: is fine .
One year---year%1:28:01:: I simply set the plants---plant%1:03:00:: in the remains---remains%1:17:00:: of a compost---compost%1:27:00:: pile---pile%1:21:00:: , to which a little sand---sand%1:27:00:: had been added , and I had the most beautiful pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: in my , or any of my neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: ' experience---experience%1:09:00:: .
In addition to the rich soil---soil%1:27:01:: they benefit by feedings---feeding%1:04:00:: of manure---manure%1:27:00:: water---water%1:27:00:: every other week---week%1:28:00:: , diluted to the color---color%1:07:00:: of weak tea---tea%1:13:00:: .
As a substitute---substitute%1:09:00:: for this , organic fertilizer---fertilizer%1:27:00:: dissolved in water---water%1:27:00:: to half---half%1:23:00:: the strength---strength%1:07:00:: in the directions---direction%1:10:02:: , may be used .
They need mulch---mulch%1:06:00:: .
We put a light mulch---mulch%1:06:00:: over the seedlings---seedling%1:20:00:: ; now we must use a heavy one .
Three inches---inch%1:23:02:: of porous material---material%1:27:00:: will do a good job---job%1:04:01:: of keeping weeds---weed%1:20:00:: down and the soil---soil%1:27:01:: moist and cool .
When winter---winter%1:28:00:: comes be ready with additional mulch---mulch%1:06:00:: .
I like hay---hay%1:13:00:: for this and apply it so that only the tops---top%1:15:01:: of the plants---plant%1:03:00:: show right after a good frost---frost%1:19:00:: .
That keeps in the cold---cold%1:07:00:: , retains moisture---moisture%1:26:00:: and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing---freezing%1:22:00:: and thawing---thawing%1:22:00:: .
Do n't miss the pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: that appear from time to time through the winter---winter%1:28:00:: .
Whenever there is a thaw---thaw%1:22:00:: or a few sunny days---day%1:28:01:: , you 'll be likely to find a brave little blossom---blossom%1:20:00:: or two .
If those are n't enough for you , why not grow some just for winter---winter%1:28:00:: blooming---blooming%1:22:00:: ?
The pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: I cherished most bloomed for me in February---february%1:28:00:: during a particularly cold winter---winter%1:28:00:: .
I started the seed---seed%1:20:00:: in a flat---flat%1:06:04:: in June---june%1:28:00:: and set out the little pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: in a cold frame---cold_frame%1:06:00:: .
( An unheated greenhouse---greenhouse%1:06:00:: would have been better , if I had had one . )
The plants---plant%1:03:00:: took zero nights---night%1:28:00:: in their stride , with nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but a mat---mat%1:06:00:: of straw---straw%1:27:00:: over the glass---glass%1:27:00:: to protect them .
In response---response%1:19:00:: to the lengthening days---day%1:28:02:: of February---february%1:28:00:: they budded , then bloomed their 4 - inch---inch%1:23:02:: velvety flowers---flower%1:20:00:: .
That cold frame---cold_frame%1:06:00:: was my morale builder---morale_builder%1:09:00:: ; its mass---mass%1:23:00:: of bright bloom---bloom%1:20:00:: set in a border---border%1:15:01:: of snow---snow%1:27:00:: made my spirits---spirit%1:26:01:: rise every time---time%1:11:00:: I looked at it .
Like strawberries---strawberry%1:13:00:: in December---december%1:28:00:: , pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: are far more exciting in February---february%1:28:00:: than in May---may%1:28:00:: .
Try that late winter---winter%1:28:00:: pickup---pickup%1:06:03:: when you are so tired of cold---cold%1:07:00:: and snow---snow%1:19:00:: that you feel you just can't take another day---day%1:28:00:: of it .
The day---day%1:28:03:: will come , in midsummer---midsummer%1:28:00:: , when you find your plants---plant%1:03:00:: becoming `` leggy '' , running to tall-growing foliage---foliage%1:20:00:: at the expense---expense%1:11:00:: of blossoms---blossom%1:20:00:: .
Try pegging down each separate branch---branch%1:20:00:: to the earth---earth%1:17:01:: , using a bobby pin---bobby_pin%1:06:00:: to hold it there .
Pick the flowers---flower%1:20:00:: , keep the soil---soil%1:27:01:: dampened , and each of the pegged-down branches---branch%1:20:00:: will take root and become a little plant---plant%1:03:00:: and go on blooming for the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the season---season%1:28:00:: .
As soon as an experimental tug---tug%1:04:00:: assures you that roots---root%1:20:00:: have taken over , cut it off from the mother---mother%1:18:00:: plant---plant%1:03:00:: .
A second and also good practice---practice%1:04:00:: is to shear off the tops---top%1:15:00:: , leaving an inch---inch%1:23:02:: high stub---stub%1:17:00:: with just a leaf---leaf%1:20:00:: or two on each branch---branch%1:20:00:: .
These cut-down plants---plant%1:03:00:: will bud and blossom in record time---time%1:28:05:: and will behave just as they did in early spring---spring%1:28:00:: .
I like to shear half---half%1:23:00:: my plants---plant%1:03:00:: at a time , leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half---second_half%1:28:00:: is getting started on its new round---round%1:28:01:: of blooming---blooming%1:22:00:: .
Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed---seed%1:20:00:: .
Probably no one needs to tell you that the way---way%1:04:01:: to stop all bloom---bloom%1:22:00:: is to let the blossoms---blossom%1:20:00:: go to seed---seed%1:20:02:: .
Nature 's aim---aim%1:09:00:: , different from ours , is to provide for the coming generation---generation%1:14:00:: .
That done , her work---work%1:04:00:: is accomplished and she ignores the plant---plant%1:03:00:: .
Here is a word of advice---word_of_advice%1:10:00:: when you go shopping---shopping%1:04:00:: for your pansy---pansy%1:20:01:: seeds---seed%1:20:00:: .
Go to a reputable grower---grower%1:18:00:: , preferably a pansy---pansy%1:20:01:: specialist---specialist%1:18:00:: .
It is no harder to raise big , healthy , blooming plants---plant%1:03:00:: than weak , sickly little things---thing%1:06:01:: ; in fact it is easier .
But you will never get better flowers---flower%1:20:00:: than the seed---seed%1:20:00:: you grow .
Many people---people%1:14:00:: think that pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: last only a few weeks---week%1:28:00:: , then their period---period%1:28:00:: of growth---growth%1:22:00:: and bloom---bloom%1:22:00:: is over .
If the plants---plant%1:03:00:: are cared for and protected over the winter---winter%1:28:00:: , the second year---year%1:28:01:: is more prolific than the first .
Would you like to grow exhibition---exhibition%1:04:00:: pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: ?
Remove about half---half%1:23:00:: the branches---branch%1:20:00:: from each plant---plant%1:03:00:: , leaving only the strongest with the largest buds---bud%1:20:00:: .
The flowers---flower%1:20:00:: will be huge .
Pansies---pansy%1:20:01:: have character---character%1:07:01:: .
They stick to their principles---principle%1:10:00:: , insist upon their due---due%1:07:00:: , but grow and bloom with dependable regularity---regularity%1:07:04:: if given it .
Treat them right and they 'll make a showing---showing%1:04:00:: every month in the year---year%1:28:01:: except the frigid ones .
Give them food---food%1:03:00:: , some shade---shade%1:26:00:: , mulch---mulch%1:06:00:: , water---water%1:27:00:: and more food---food%1:03:00:: , and they 'll repay your solicitude---solicitude%1:12:00:: with beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: .
A salad---salad%1:13:00:: with greens---greens%1:13:00:: and tomato---tomato%1:13:00:: is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition---addition%1:06:00:: to a meal---meal%1:13:00:: , but add an avocado---avocado%1:13:00:: and you have something really special .
This delightful tropical fruit---fruit%1:20:00:: has become well-known in the past thirty years---year%1:28:01:: because modern transportation---transportation%1:04:00:: methods---method%1:09:00:: have made it possible to ship avocado---avocado%1:13:00:: anywhere in the United States---united_states%1:15:00:: .
It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you have n't made avocado---avocado%1:13:00:: a part---part%1:24:00:: of your diet---diet%1:13:00:: yet , you really should .
You will find that avocado---avocado%1:13:00:: is unlike any other fruit---fruit%1:20:00:: you have ever tasted .
It is roughly shaped like a large pear---pear%1:13:00:: , and when properly ripened , its dark green---green%1:07:00:: skin covers a meaty , melon---melon%1:13:00:: like pulp---pulp%1:20:00:: that has about the consistency---consistency%1:07:00:: of a ripe Bartlett pear---bartlett_pear%1:13:00:: , but oily .
The avocado---avocado%1:13:00:: should have a `` give---give%1:07:00:: '' to it , as you hold it , when it is ripe .
The flavor---flavor%1:09:00:: is neither sweet , like a pear---pear%1:13:00:: , nor tart like an orange---orange%1:13:00:: ; it is subtle and rather bland , nut---nut%1:20:00:: like .
It is a flavor---flavor%1:09:00:: that might take a little getting used to - not because it is unpleasant , but because the flavor---flavor%1:09:00:: is hard to define in the light of our experience---experience%1:09:00:: with other fruits---fruit%1:20:00:: .
Sometimes it takes several `` eatings---eating%1:04:00:: '' of avocado---avocado%1:13:00:: to catch that delightful quality---quality%1:07:00:: in taste---taste%1:09:02:: that has made it such a favorite---favorite%1:09:00:: throughout the world .
Once you become an avocado---avocado%1:13:00:: fan---fan%1:18:00:: , you will look forward to the season---season%1:28:02:: each year with eager anticipation---anticipation%1:12:00:: .
Today---today%1:28:00:: , refrigerated carriers---carrier%1:06:03:: have made the shipping---shipping%1:04:00:: of avocados---avocado%1:13:00:: possible to any place---place%1:15:04:: in the world---world%1:17:00:: .
The fruit---fruit%1:20:00:: is allowed to mature on the tree---tree%1:20:00:: , but it is still firm at this point---point%1:28:00:: .
It is brought to packing houses---packinghouse%1:06:01:: , cleaned and graded as to size---size%1:07:00:: and quality---quality%1:07:00:: , and packed in protective excelsior---excelsior%1:27:00:: .
The fruit---fruit%1:20:00:: is then cooled to 42 ` F.---f%1:23:02:: , a temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state---state%1:03:00:: .
This cooling---cooling%1:22:00:: does not change the avocado---avocado%1:13:00:: in any way---way%1:07:01:: , it just delays the natural softening---softening%1:22:00:: of the fruit---fruit%1:20:00:: until a grove---grove%1:06:00:: like temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: ( room temperature---room_temperature%1:07:00:: ) is restored .
This happens on the grocer---grocer%1:18:00:: 's shelf---shelf%1:06:00:: or in your kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: .
One of the most attractive things---thing%1:07:00:: about avocados---avocado%1:13:00:: is that they do not require processing of any kind---kind%1:09:00:: .
There is no dyeing---dyeing%1:04:00:: or waxing---waxing%1:04:00:: or gassing---gassing%1:22:00:: needed .
If the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: is controlled properly , the avocado---avocado%1:13:00:: will delay its ripening---ripening%1:22:00:: until needed .
And unlike other fruits---fruit%1:20:00:: , one cannot eat the skin of the avocado---avocado%1:13:00:: .
It is thick , much like an egg plant---eggplant%1:13:00:: 's skin , so that poison---poison%1:27:00:: sprays---spray%1:27:01:: , if they are used , present no hazard---hazard%1:26:00:: to the consumer---consumer%1:18:00:: .
Good taste---taste%1:09:02:: and versatility---versatility%1:09:00:: , plus safety---safety%1:26:00:: from spray---spray%1:27:01:: poisons---poison%1:27:00:: would be enough to recommend the frequent use---use%1:04:00:: of such a fruit---fruit%1:20:00:: , even if its nutritional values---value%1:07:00:: were limited .
Avocados---avocado%1:13:00:: , however , are very rich in nutrients---nutrient%1:03:00:: .
Their main asset is an abundance---abundance%1:07:00:: of unsaturated fatty acids---fatty_acid%1:27:00:: , so necessary for maintaining the good health---good_health%1:26:00:: of the circulatory system---circulatory_system%1:08:00:: .
Aside from this , the average portion---portion%1:24:00:: contains some protein---protein%1:27:00:: , an appreciable amount---amount%1:03:00:: of vitamins---vitamin%1:27:00:: and C---vitamin_c%1:27:00:: - about one-tenth---one-tenth%1:23:00:: of the minimum daily requirement---requirement%1:17:00:: , and about a third---third%1:23:00:: of the official vitamin E---vitamin_e%1:27:00:: requirement---requirement%1:17:00:: .
The B vitamins---b_vitamin%1:27:00:: are well represented , especially thiamin---thiamin%1:27:00:: and riboflavin---riboflavin%1:27:00:: .
Calcium---calcium%1:27:00:: , phosphorus---phosphorus%1:27:00:: and iron---iron%1:27:00:: are present in worthwhile amounts---amount%1:03:00:: , and eleven other minerals---mineral%1:27:00:: also have been found in varying trace---trace%1:23:00:: amounts---amount%1:03:00:: .
None of these values---value%1:07:00:: is destroyed , not significantly altered by refrigeration---refrigeration%1:22:00:: storage---storage%1:04:01:: .
Dr. Wilson C. Grant---person%1:03:00:: , of the Veterans ' Administration Hospital---group%1:03:00:: , Coral Gables---location%1:03:00:: , Florida---florida%1:15:00:: , and the University of Miami School of Medicine---location%1:03:00:: , set out to discover if avocados---avocado%1:13:00:: , because of their high content---content%1:23:00:: of unsaturated fatty acids---fatty_acid%1:27:00:: , would reduce the cholesterol---cholesterol%1:27:00:: of the blood---blood%1:08:00:: in selected patients---patient%1:18:00:: .
The study---study%1:04:00:: comprised 16 male patients---patient%1:18:00:: , ranging in age---age%1:07:00:: from 27 to 72 .
They were put on control---control%1:09:02:: diets---diet%1:13:00:: to determine as accurately as possible , the normal cholesterol---cholesterol%1:27:00:: level---level%1:07:00:: of their blood---blood%1:08:00:: .
Then they were given 1 2 to 1 - 1 2 avocados---avocado%1:13:00:: per day---day%1:28:00:: as a substitute---substitute%1:09:00:: for part---part%1:24:00:: of their dietary fat---fat%1:27:00:: consumption---consumption%1:04:01:: .
The controversy---controversy%1:10:00:: of the last few years---year%1:28:01:: over whether architects---architect%1:18:00:: or interior designers---interior_designer%1:18:00:: should plan the interiors---interior%1:15:01:: of modern buildings---building%1:06:00:: has brought clearly into focus---focus%1:07:03:: one important difference of opinion---difference_of_opinion%1:10:00:: .
The architects---architect%1:18:00:: do not believe that the education---education%1:09:00:: of the interior designer---interior_designer%1:18:00:: is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect---architect%1:18:00:: and that , therefore , the interior designer---interior_designer%1:18:00:: is incapable of understanding the architectural principles---principle%1:09:03:: involved in planning the interior---interior%1:15:01:: of a building---building%1:06:00:: .
Ordinary politeness---politeness%1:07:00:: may have militated against this opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance---acquaintance%1:09:00:: in both groups---group%1:03:00:: and who has sat through the many round tables---round_table%1:10:00:: , workshops---workshop%1:04:00:: or panel discussions---panel_discussion%1:10:00:: - whatever they are called - on this subject---subject%1:10:00:: will recognize that the final , boiled down crux of the matter---crux_of_the_matter%1:10:00:: is education---education%1:09:00:: .
It is true that most architectural schools have five year---year%1:28:02:: courses , some even have six or more .
It is true that most architectural schools---school%1:14:00:: have five year---year%1:28:01:: courses---course%1:04:01:: , some even have six or more .
The element---element%1:09:00:: of public danger---danger%1:26:00:: which enters so largely into architectural certification---certification%1:04:00:: , however , would demand a prolonged study---study%1:09:03:: of structure---structure%1:07:00:: .
This would , naturally , lengthen their courses---course%1:04:01:: far beyond the largely esthetic demands---demand%1:09:00:: of interior designer---interior_designer%1:18:00:: 's training---training%1:04:00:: .
We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year---year%1:28:02:: course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject .
We may then dismiss the time---time%1:28:05:: difference---difference%1:07:00:: between these courses---course%1:04:01:: and the usual four year---year%1:28:01:: course---course%1:04:01:: of the interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: student---student%1:18:00:: as not having serious bearing---bearing%1:24:01:: on the subject---subject%1:10:00:: .
The real question---question%1:10:00:: that follows is - how are those four years---year%1:28:01:: used and what is their value---value%1:07:00:: as training---training%1:04:00:: ?
The real question that follows is - how are those four years---year%1:28:02:: used and what is their value as training ?
The American Institute of Interior Designers---group%1:03:00:: has published a recommended course---course%1:04:01:: for designers---designer%1:18:02:: and a percentage---percentage%1:21:00:: layout---layout%1:09:00:: of such a course---course%1:04:01:: .
An examination---examination%1:04:00:: of some forty catalogs---catalog%1:10:00:: of schools---school%1:14:00:: offering courses---course%1:04:01:: in interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: , for the most part schools---school%1:14:00:: accredited by membership---membership%1:26:00:: in the National Association of Schools of Art---group%1:03:00:: , and a further `` on the spot '' inspection of a number---number%1:07:00:: of schools---school%1:14:00:: , show their courses---course%1:04:01:: adhere pretty closely to the recommendations---recommendation%1:10:00:: .
One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum , but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four year---year%1:28:02:: plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions .
One or two of the schools---school%1:14:00:: have a five year---year%1:28:01:: curriculum---curriculum%1:10:00:: , but the usual pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: of American education---education%1:04:00:: has limited most of them to the four year---year%1:28:01:: plan---plan%1:09:00:: which seems to be the minimum---minimum%1:23:00:: in acceptable institutions---institution%1:14:00:: .
The suggested course---course%1:04:01:: of the A.I.D.---group%1:03:00:: was based on the usual course---course%1:04:01:: offered and on the opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: of many educators---educator%1:18:00:: as to curricular necessities---necessity%1:17:00:: .
Obviously , the four year---year%1:28:01:: provision---provision%1:10:00:: limits this to fundamentals---fundamentals%1:09:00:: and much desirable material---material%1:27:00:: must be eliminated .
Obviously , the four year---year%1:28:02:: provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated .
Without comparing the relative merits---merit%1:07:01:: of the two courses---course%1:04:01:: - architecture---architecture%1:09:00:: versus interior design---interior_design%1:09:00:: - let us examine the educational needs---need%1:03:00:: of the interior designer---interior_designer%1:18:00:: .
To begin with , what is an interior designer---interior_designer%1:18:00:: ?
`` The Dictionary of Occupational Titles '' published by the U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: Department of Labor---department_of_labor%1:14:00:: describes him as follows :
`` Designs , plans and furnishes interiors---interior%1:15:01:: of houses---house%1:06:00:: , commercial and institutional structures---structure%1:06:00:: , hotels---hotel%1:06:00:: , clubs---club%1:06:02:: , ships---ship%1:06:00:: , theaters---theater%1:06:00:: , as well as set decorations---set_decoration%1:06:00:: for motion picture---motion_picture%1:10:00:: arts---arts%1:09:00:: and television---television%1:10:00:: .
Makes drawings---drawing%1:06:00:: and plans---plan%1:06:00:: of rooms---room%1:06:00:: showing placement---placement%1:07:00:: of furniture---furniture%1:06:00:: , floor coverings---floor_covering%1:06:00:: , wall---wall%1:06:00:: decorations---decoration%1:06:00:: , and determines color schemes---color_scheme%1:14:00:: .
Furnishes complete cost---cost%1:21:00:: estimates---estimate%1:10:00:: for clients---client%1:18:00:: approval---approval%1:04:02:: .
Makes necessary purchases---purchase%1:04:00:: , places contracts , supervises construction---construction%1:04:00:: , installation---installation%1:04:00:: , finishing---finishing%1:07:00:: and placement---placement%1:04:00:: of furniture---furniture%1:06:00:: , fixtures---fixture%1:06:00:: and other correlated furnishings , and follows through to completion of project---project%1:04:00:: `` .
In addition to this the U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: Civil Service Bureau---group%1:03:00:: , when examining applicants---applicant%1:18:00:: for government---government%1:14:00:: positions---position%1:04:01:: as interior designers---interior_designer%1:18:00:: , expects that `` when various needed objects---object%1:03:00:: are not obtainable on the market---market%1:04:00:: he will design them .
He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture---manufacture%1:04:00:: of any craft---craft%1:04:00:: materials---material%1:06:00:: needed in the furnishings '' .
This seems like a large order---large_order%1:04:00:: .
The interior designer---interior_designer%1:18:00:: , then , must first be an artist---artist%1:18:00:: but also understand carpentry---carpentry%1:04:00:: and painting---painting%1:04:01:: and lighting---lighting%1:04:01:: and plumbing---plumbing%1:04:01:: and finance---finance%1:04:00:: .
Yet nobody will question the necessity---necessity%1:26:00:: of all this and any reputable interior designer---interior_designer%1:18:00:: does know all this and does practice it .
And further he must understand his obligation---obligation%1:04:00:: to the client---client%1:18:00:: to not only meet his physical necessities---necessity%1:17:00:: but also to enhance and improve his life---life%1:26:02:: and to enlarge the cultural horizon---horizon%1:07:00:: of our society---society%1:14:00:: .
Few will quarrel with the aim---aim%1:09:00:: of the schools---school%1:14:00:: or with the wording---wording%1:10:00:: of their curriculum---curriculum%1:10:00:: .
It is in the quality---quality%1:07:02:: of the teaching---teaching%1:04:00:: of all this that a question---question%1:10:01:: may arise .
The old established independent art schools---art_school%1:06:00:: try their best to fulfill their obligations---obligation%1:04:00:: .
Yet even here many a problem---problem%1:26:00:: is presented ; as in a recent design---design%1:04:00:: competition---competition%1:11:00:: with a floor plan---floor_plan%1:06:00:: and the simple command---command%1:10:00:: - `` design a luxury apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: '' ; no description---description%1:10:01:: of the client---client%1:18:00:: or his cultural level---level%1:07:00:: , no assertion---assertion%1:10:01:: of geographical area---geographical_area%1:15:00:: or local social necessities---necessity%1:17:00:: - simply `` a luxury apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: '' .
Working in a vacuum---vacuum%1:26:00:: of minimal information---information%1:10:00:: can result only in show pieces---showpiece%1:06:00:: that look good in exhibitions---exhibition%1:14:00:: and catalogs---catalog%1:10:00:: and may please the public relations---public_relations%1:10:00:: department---department%1:14:00:: but have little---little%1:23:00:: to do with the essence---essence%1:09:00:: of interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: .
It is possible , of course , to work on extant or projected buildings---building%1:06:00:: where either architect---architect%1:18:00:: or owner---owner%1:18:00:: will explain their necessities---necessity%1:26:00:: so that the student---student%1:18:00:: may get `` the feel---feel%1:09:00:: '' of real interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: demands---demand%1:09:00:: .
Unfortunately , the purely synthetic problem---problem%1:26:00:: is the rule---rule%1:09:01:: .
It is like medical schools---medical_school%1:14:00:: in India---location%1:03:00:: where , in that fairy land---fairyland%1:09:00:: of religious inhibition---inhibition%1:04:00:: , the dissection---dissection%1:04:01:: of dead bodies---dead_body%1:08:00:: is frowned upon .
Instead they learn their dissection---dissection%1:04:01:: on the bulbs---bulb%1:20:00:: of plants---plant%1:03:00:: .
Thus technical efficiency---efficiency%1:09:00:: is achieved at the expense---expense%1:11:00:: of actual experience---experience%1:09:01:: .
In the earlier years---year%1:28:01:: of training---training%1:04:00:: certain phases---phase%1:28:00:: of the work---work%1:09:00:: must be covered and the synthetic problem---problem%1:26:00:: has its use---use%1:07:00:: .
But to continue to divorce advanced students---student%1:18:00:: from reality---reality%1:09:00:: is inexcusable .
Consultation---consultation%1:10:01:: with architects---architect%1:18:00:: , clients---client%1:18:00:: , real estate---real_estate%1:21:00:: men---man%1:18:00:: , fabric---fabric%1:06:00:: houses---house%1:14:01:: and furniture---furniture%1:06:00:: companies---company%1:14:01:: is essential to the proper development---development%1:22:02:: of class---class%1:14:03:: problems---problem%1:26:00:: just as in actual work---work%1:04:01:: .
Fortunately , although only a few years---year%1:28:01:: ago they held the student---student%1:18:00:: at arms length , today---today%1:28:00:: the business houses---house%1:14:01:: welcome the opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: to aid the student---student%1:18:00:: , not only from an increased sense---sense%1:09:05:: of community---community%1:14:00:: responsibility---responsibility%1:04:00:: but also from the realization---realization%1:09:00:: that the student---student%1:18:00:: of today---today%1:28:00:: is the interior designer---interior_designer%1:18:00:: of tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:01:: - that the student---student%1:18:00:: already is `` in the trade---trade%1:04:00:: '' .
Even the `` history---history%1:10:00:: of furniture---furniture%1:06:00:: '' can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs---photograph%1:06:00:: and lantern slides---lantern_slide%1:06:00:: .
Here , too , the reality---reality%1:09:00:: of actual furniture---furniture%1:06:00:: must be experienced .
The professional organizations---organization%1:14:00:: such as American Institute of Interior Designers---group%1:03:00:: , National Society of Interior Designers---group%1:03:00:: , Home Fashions League---group%1:03:00:: and various trade---trade%1:14:00:: associations---association%1:14:00:: , can and do aid greatly in this work---work%1:04:00:: .
Certainly every educator---educator%1:18:00:: involved in interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: should be a member---member%1:18:00:: and active in the work---work%1:04:00:: of one of these organizations---organization%1:14:00:: .
Not only should every educator---educator%1:18:00:: above the rank---rank%1:26:00:: of instructor---instructor%1:18:00:: be expected to be a member---member%1:18:00:: of one of the professional organizations---organization%1:14:00:: , but his first qualification---qualification%1:07:00:: for membership---membership%1:26:00:: as an educator---educator%1:18:00:: should be so sharply scrutinized that membership---membership%1:26:00:: would be equivalent to certification---certification%1:04:00:: to teach the subject---subject%1:09:00:: .
Participation---participation%1:04:00:: for the educator---educator%1:18:00:: in this case---case%1:11:00:: , however , would have to be raised to full and complete membership---membership%1:26:00:: .
The largest of these organizations---organization%1:14:00:: at present denies to the full time educator---educator%1:18:00:: any vote---vote%1:04:00:: on the conduct---conduct%1:07:00:: and standards---standard%1:09:00:: of the group---group%1:03:00:: and , indeed , refuses him even the right---right%1:07:00:: to attach the customary initials---initial%1:10:00:: after his name---name%1:10:00:: in the college---college%1:14:00:: catalog---catalog%1:10:01:: .
This anomalous status---status%1:26:00:: of the educator---educator%1:18:00:: cannot fail to lower his standing---standing%1:26:00:: in the eyes---eyes%1:09:00:: of the students---student%1:18:00:: .
The professor---professor%1:18:00:: in turn dares not tolerate the influence---influence%1:07:00:: in his classes---class%1:14:03:: of an organization---organization%1:14:00:: in the policies---policy%1:09:00:: and standards---standard%1:09:00:: of which he has no voice---voice%1:10:01:: .
This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications---qualification%1:07:00:: for membership---membership%1:26:00:: which the organizations---organization%1:14:00:: profess are ever enforced , the educator---educator%1:18:00:: will have the molding---molding%1:04:01:: of the entire profession---profession%1:14:00:: in his hands---hands%1:04:00:: .
In one way---way%1:26:00:: the Institutes---institute%1:14:00:: and Societies---society%1:14:01:: do a disservice---disservice%1:04:00:: to the schools---school%1:14:00:: .
That is in the continuance---continuance%1:04:00:: of the `` grandfather clauses---grandfather_clause%1:26:00:: '' in their membership---membership%1:26:00:: requirements---requirement%1:09:00:: .
When these groups---group%1:03:00:: were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators---decorator%1:18:01:: could not have had the advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: of school---school%1:14:00:: training---training%1:04:00:: since interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: courses---course%1:04:01:: were rare and undeveloped during their youth---youth%1:28:01:: .
Long hard years---year%1:28:01:: of `` on the job '' training---training%1:04:00:: had brought them to their competence---competence%1:07:00:: .
The necessity---necessity%1:26:00:: of that day---day%1:28:03:: has long disappeared .
There is plenty---plenty%1:07:00:: of opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: for proper education---education%1:04:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: .
It is discouraging for students---student%1:18:00:: to realize that the societies---society%1:14:01:: do not truly uphold the standards---standard%1:09:00:: for which they are supposed to stand .
The reason---reason%1:16:00:: and the day---day%1:28:03:: of `` grandfather clauses---grandfather_clause%1:26:00:: '' has long since passed .
No one can deny that these `` back door---back_door%1:04:00:: '' admissions---admission%1:04:00:: to membership---membership%1:14:00:: provisions---provision%1:10:00:: have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission---admission%1:04:00:: of downright incompetents---incompetent%1:18:00:: to membership---membership%1:26:00:: in supposedly learned societies---society%1:14:01:: .
Beyond any question---question%1:10:01:: of curriculum---curriculum%1:10:00:: and approach---approach%1:04:02:: to subject---subject%1:09:00:: must be the quality---quality%1:07:02:: of the teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: themselves .
It will occur to anyone that the teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: must have adequate education---education%1:09:00:: , a depth---depth%1:07:01:: and breadth---breadth%1:09:00:: of knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: far beyond the immediate necessities---necessity%1:26:00:: of his course---course%1:04:01:: plus complete dedication---dedication%1:07:00:: to his subject---subject%1:09:00:: and to his students---student%1:18:00:: .
The local decorator---decorator%1:18:01:: who rushes in for a few hours---hour%1:28:00:: of teaching---teaching%1:04:00:: may but more likely may not have these qualifications---qualification%1:07:00:: .
Nor will the hack---hack%1:18:00:: , the Jack-of-all-trades---jack_of_all_trades%1:18:01:: , still found in some of the smaller art schools---art_school%1:06:00:: , suffice .
Only a few years---year%1:28:01:: ago a middle western college---college%1:14:00:: circulated a request---request%1:10:01:: for a teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: of interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: .
At the end---end%1:09:00:: of its letter---letter%1:10:00:: was the information---information%1:10:00:: that applicants---applicant%1:18:00:: for this position---position%1:04:01:: `` must also be prepared to teach costume---costume%1:06:00:: design---design%1:04:00:: and advertising---advertising%1:10:00:: art---art%1:10:00:: '' .
This kind---kind%1:09:00:: of irresponsibility---irresponsibility%1:07:00:: toward their students---student%1:18:00:: can scarcely build a strong professional attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: in the future designer---designer%1:18:02:: .
We must build a corps---corps%1:14:01:: of highly professional teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: of interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: who have had education---education%1:09:00:: , experience---experience%1:09:01:: in the profession---profession%1:14:00:: and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments---accompaniment%1:11:00:: of teaching---teaching%1:04:00:: - minimal income---income%1:21:00:: and minimal status---status%1:26:00:: among their confreres---confrere%1:18:00:: .
Considerable specialization---specialization%1:04:00:: in teaching---teaching%1:04:00:: subjects---subject%1:09:00:: such as architecture---architecture%1:04:00:: , furniture---furniture%1:06:00:: design---design%1:04:00:: , textiles---textile%1:06:00:: and color---color%1:07:00:: is also desirable .
In all `` degree---degree%1:10:00:: '' courses---course%1:04:01:: in interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: a number---number%1:07:00:: of `` academic '' or `` general studies---study%1:09:02:: '' courses---course%1:04:01:: are included .
It is only fair to demand that teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: of courses---course%1:04:01:: in English---english%1:09:00:: , history---history%1:09:00:: , psychology---psychology%1:09:00:: and so on be as well informed in matters---matter%1:09:00:: of art---art%1:06:00:: , especially interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: , as are the art teachers---art_teacher%1:18:00:: educated in the academic subjects---subject%1:09:00:: .
The proper correlation---correlation%1:24:00:: of the art---art%1:04:00:: with the academic can be achieved only if this standard---standard%1:09:00:: is observed .
The matter---matter%1:09:00:: of sympathy---sympathy%1:09:00:: of the academic professors---professor%1:18:00:: for art---art%1:04:00:: objectives---objective%1:09:00:: also must be taken into account .
One technical question---question%1:10:01:: of school---school%1:14:00:: organization---organization%1:04:00:: comes to mind here .
For proper accreditation---accreditation%1:04:00:: of schools---school%1:14:00:: , teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: in any course---course%1:04:01:: must have a degree---degree%1:10:00:: at least one level---level%1:26:01:: above that for which the student---student%1:18:00:: is a candidate---candidate%1:18:00:: .
Since there are almost no schools---school%1:14:00:: in the country---country%1:15:00:: offering graduate work---work%1:09:00:: in interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: this rule---rule%1:09:01:: cannot at present be observed .
Indeed , it has only been a matter---matter%1:09:00:: of the last few years---year%1:28:01:: that reputable schools---school%1:14:00:: of art---art%1:04:00:: have granted degrees---degree%1:10:00:: at all .
The question---question%1:10:01:: , however , cannot be ignored for long .
The basic problem---problem%1:26:00:: involved is that a college---college%1:14:00:: setting up a graduate school---graduate_school%1:14:00:: must have an entirely separate faculty---faculty%1:14:00:: for the advanced degree---degree%1:10:00:: .
Most professors---professor%1:18:00:: in the course---course%1:04:01:: must , naturally , again have a higher degree---degree%1:10:00:: than the course---course%1:04:01:: offers .
One solution---solution%1:10:00:: is the acquisition---acquisition%1:04:00:: of degrees---degree%1:10:00:: in education---education%1:04:01:: but it is a poor substitute---substitute%1:09:00:: .
It is a sort of academic ring-around-a rosy---ring-around-a-rosy%1:04:00:: and you solve it .
This brings us to the question---question%1:10:01:: of accreditation---accreditation%1:04:00:: of art schools---art_school%1:06:00:: in general .
Only the independent art schools---art_school%1:06:00:: , that is , those not connected with any university---university%1:14:00:: or college---college%1:14:00:: , receive severe and separate investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: before accreditation---accreditation%1:04:00:: by the various regional organizations---organization%1:14:00:: .
It has been the custom---custom%1:04:00:: for most universities---university%1:14:00:: to stretch the blanket of accreditation---accreditation%1:04:00:: for their liberal arts---liberal_arts%1:09:00:: school---school%1:14:00:: to cover the shivering body of their fine arts---fine_arts%1:09:00:: department---department%1:14:00:: .
This , plus the habit---habit%1:04:02:: of many schools---school%1:14:00:: of simply adding interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: to the many subjects---subject%1:09:00:: of their home economics---home_economics%1:09:00:: department---department%1:14:00:: , yet , nevertheless , claiming that they teach interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: , has contributed to the low repute---repute%1:26:00:: of many university---university%1:14:00:: courses---course%1:04:01:: in interior design---interior_design%1:04:00:: .
In spite of this , many universities---university%1:14:00:: offer adequate and even distinguished courses---course%1:04:01:: in the subject---subject%1:09:00:: .
There will be no mitigation---mitigation%1:04:00:: of these offences---offence%1:04:00:: until all art schools---art_school%1:06:00:: , whether independent or attached to universities---university%1:14:00:: have separate accreditation---accreditation%1:04:00:: - as do medical schools---medical_school%1:14:00:: - by an art---art%1:04:00:: accreditation---accreditation%1:04:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: such as the `` National Association of Schools of Art---group%1:03:00:: '' .
Independent art schools---art_school%1:06:00:: granting degrees---degree%1:10:00:: must , naturally , follow this with academic accreditation---accreditation%1:04:00:: by the appropriate regional group---group%1:03:00:: .
The Bishop---bishop%1:18:00:: looked at him coldly and said `` Take it or leave it '' !
Literally , there was nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: else to do .
He was caught in a machine---machine%1:06:00:: .
But Sojourner---person%1:03:00:: was not easily excited or upset and said quite calmly : `` Let 's go and see what it 's like '' .
Annisberg---location%1:03:00:: was about seventy-five miles---mile%1:23:01:: west---west%1:24:00:: of Birmingham---location%1:03:00:: , near the Georgia---location%1:03:00:: border---border%1:15:00:: and on the Tallahoosa River---location%1:03:00:: , a small and dirty stream---stream%1:17:00:: .
The city---city%1:15:00:: was a center---center%1:15:01:: of manufacture---manufacture%1:04:00:: , especially in textiles---textile%1:06:00:: , and also because of the beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: of some of its surroundings---surroundings%1:26:00:: , a residence---residence%1:06:00:: for many owners---owner%1:18:00:: of the great industries---industry%1:04:00:: in north Alabama---location%1:03:00:: .
But it had , as was usual in southern cities---city%1:15:00:: of this sort---sort%1:09:00:: , a Black Bottom---location%1:03:00:: , a low region---region%1:15:00:: near the river---river%1:17:00:: where the Negroes---person%1:03:00:: lived - servants---servant%1:18:00:: and laborers---laborer%1:18:00:: huddled together in a region---region%1:15:00:: with no sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: save the river---river%1:17:00:: , where streets---street%1:06:00:: and sidewalks---sidewalk%1:06:00:: were neglected and where there was much poverty---poverty%1:26:00:: and crime---crime%1:04:00:: .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: came by train---train%1:06:00:: from Birmingham---location%1:03:00:: and looked the city---city%1:15:00:: over ; the rather pleasant white city---city%1:15:00:: was on the hill---hill%1:17:00:: where the chief stores---store%1:06:00:: were .
Beyond were industries---industry%1:04:00:: and factories---factory%1:06:00:: .
Then they went down to Black Bottom---location%1:03:00:: .
In the midst of this crowded region---region%1:15:00:: was the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church---group%1:03:00:: .
It was an old and dirty wooden structure---structure%1:06:00:: , sadly in need---need%1:26:00:: of repair---repair%1:04:00:: .
But it was a landmark---landmark%1:15:00:: .
It had been there 50 years---year%1:28:01:: or more and everybody in town---town%1:15:00:: , black and white , knew of it .
It had just suffered a calamity---calamity%1:11:00:: , the final crisis---crisis%1:11:00:: in a long series---series%1:14:00:: of calamities---calamity%1:11:00:: .
For the old preacher---preacher%1:18:00:: who had been there twenty-five years---year%1:28:01:: was dead , and the city---city%1:14:00:: mourned him .
He was a loud-voiced man---man%1:18:00:: , once vigorous but for many years---year%1:28:01:: now declining in strength---strength%1:07:00:: and ability---ability%1:07:00:: .
He was stern and overbearing with his flock---flock%1:14:02:: , but obsequious and conciliatory with the whites---white%1:18:00:: , especially the rich who partly supported the church---church%1:06:00:: .
The Deacon Board---group%1:03:00:: , headed by a black man---black_man%1:18:00:: named Carlson---person%1:03:00:: , had practically taken over as the pastor---pastor%1:18:00:: grew old , and had its way with the support---support%1:04:00:: of the Amen corner---amen_corner%1:06:00:: .
The characteristic thing---thing%1:07:00:: about this church---church%1:06:00:: was its Amen corner---amen_corner%1:06:00:: and the weekly religious orgy---orgy%1:04:01:: .
A knot---knot%1:14:00:: of old worshippers---worshipper%1:18:00:: , chiefly women---woman%1:18:00:: , listened weekly to a sermon---sermon%1:10:00:: .
It began invariably in low tones---tone%1:10:01:: , almost conversational , and then gradually worked up to high , shrill appeals---appeal%1:10:00:: to God---god%1:18:00:: and man .
And then the Amen corner---amen_corner%1:06:00:: took hold , re-enacting a form---form%1:09:01:: of group participation---group_participation%1:04:00:: in worship---worship%1:04:00:: that stemmed from years---year%1:28:01:: before the Greek chorus---greek_chorus%1:14:00:: , spreading down through the African forest---forest%1:14:00:: , overseas to the West Indies---location%1:03:00:: , and then here in Alabama---location%1:03:00:: .
With shout---shout%1:10:00:: and slow dance---dance%1:10:00:: , with tears---tears%1:04:00:: and song---song%1:04:00:: , with scream---scream%1:10:00:: and contortion---contortion%1:04:00:: , the corner---corner%1:15:02:: group---group%1:03:00:: was beset by hysteria---hysteria%1:26:01:: and shivering , wailing---wailing%1:04:01:: , shouting , possession---possession%1:04:00:: of something that seemed like an alien and outside force---force%1:19:00:: .
It spread to most of the audience---audience%1:14:00:: and was often viewed by visiting whites---white%1:18:00:: who snickered behind handkerchief---handkerchief%1:06:00:: and afterward discussed Negro---negro%1:18:00:: religion---religion%1:09:00:: .
It sometimes ended in death-like trances---trance%1:26:00:: with many lying exhausted and panting on chair---chair%1:06:00:: and floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
To most of those who composed the Amen corner---amen_corner%1:06:00:: it was a magnificent and beautiful experience---experience%1:11:00:: , something for which they lived from week---week%1:28:00:: to week---week%1:28:00:: .
It was often re-enacted in less wild form---form%1:09:00:: at the Wednesday---wednesday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: prayer meeting---prayer_meeting%1:04:00:: .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: , on his first Sunday , witnessed this with something like disgust---disgust%1:12:00:: .
He had preached a short sermon---sermon%1:10:00:: , trying to talk man-to-man to the audience---audience%1:14:00:: , to tell them who he was , what he had done in Macon---location%1:03:00:: and Birmingham---birmingham%1:15:01:: , and what he proposed to do here .
He sympathized with them on the loss---loss%1:11:01:: of their old pastor---pastor%1:18:00:: .
But then , at mention---mention%1:10:01:: of that name---name%1:10:00:: , the Amen corner---amen_corner%1:06:00:: broke loose .
He had no chance---chance%1:26:00:: to say another word---word%1:10:00:: .
At the very end---end%1:11:00:: , when the audience---audience%1:14:00:: was silent and breathless , a collection---collection%1:10:01:: was taken and then slowly everyone filed out .
The audience---audience%1:14:00:: did not think much of the new pastor---pastor%1:18:00:: , and what the new pastor---pastor%1:18:00:: thought of the audience---audience%1:14:00:: he did not dare at the time---time%1:28:00:: to say .
During the next weeks---week%1:28:00:: he looked over the situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
First of all there was the parsonage---parsonage%1:06:00:: , an utterly impossible place---place%1:15:04:: for civilized people---people%1:14:00:: to live in , originally poorly conceived , apparently not repaired for years---year%1:28:01:: , with no plumbing---plumbing%1:06:00:: or sewage---sewage%1:27:00:: , with rat-holes---rathole%1:17:00:: and rot---rot%1:22:00:: .
It was arranged that he would board in the home---home%1:06:00:: of one of the old members---member%1:18:00:: of the church---church%1:14:00:: , a woman---woman%1:18:00:: named Catt---person%1:03:00:: who , as Wilson---person%1:03:00:: afterward found , was briefly referred to as The Cat---person%1:03:00:: because of her sharp tongue and fierce initiative---initiative%1:07:00:: .
Ann Catt---person%1:03:00:: was a lonely , devoted soul---soul%1:03:00:: , never married , conducting a spotless home---home%1:06:00:: and devoted to her church---church%1:14:00:: , but a perpetual dissenter---dissenter%1:18:00:: and born critic---critic%1:18:01:: .
She soared over the new pastor---pastor%1:18:00:: like an avenging angel---angel%1:18:00:: lest he stray from the path---path%1:04:00:: and not know all the truth---truth%1:09:00:: and gossip---gossip%1:10:00:: of which she was chief repository---repository%1:18:00:: .
Then Wilson---person%1:03:00:: looked over the church---church%1:06:00:: and studied its condition---condition%1:26:00:: .
The salary---salary%1:21:00:: of the pastor---pastor%1:18:00:: had for years---year%1:28:01:: been $ 500 annually and even this was in arrears .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: made up his mind that he must receive at least $ 2500 , but when he mentioned this to the Deacons---deacon%1:18:01:: they said nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
The church---church%1:06:00:: itself must be repaired .
It really ought to be rebuilt , and he determined to go up and talk to the city---city%1:15:00:: banks---bank%1:14:00:: about this .
Meanwhile , the city---city%1:15:01:: itself should be talked to .
The streets---street%1:06:00:: in the colored section---section%1:15:01:: were dirty .
There was typhoid---typhoid%1:26:00:: and malaria---malaria%1:26:00:: .
The children---child%1:18:00:: had nowhere to go and no place---place%1:15:00:: to play , not even sidewalks---sidewalk%1:06:00:: .
The school---school%1:06:00:: was small , dark and ill-equipped .
The teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: was a pliant fool---fool%1:18:00:: .
There were two liquor---liquor%1:13:00:: saloons---saloon%1:06:00:: not very far from the church---church%1:06:00:: , one---one%1:23:00:: white---white%1:18:00:: , that is conducted for white people---people%1:14:00:: with a side entrance---side_entrance%1:06:00:: for Negroes---person%1:03:00:: ; the other exclusively Negro---person%1:03:00:: .
Undoubtedly , there was a good deal---good_deal%1:23:00:: of gambling---gambling%1:04:00:: in both .
On the other side---side%1:15:02:: of the church---church%1:06:00:: was a quiet , well-kept house---house%1:06:00:: with shutters---shutter%1:06:00:: and recently painted .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: inquired about it .
It was called Kent House---location%1:03:00:: .
The deacon---deacon%1:18:01:: of the church---church%1:14:00:: , Carlson---person%1:03:00:: , was its janitor---janitor%1:18:00:: .
One of the leading members---member%1:18:00:: of the Amen corner---amen_corner%1:06:00:: was cook---cook%1:18:00:: ; there were two or three colored maids---maid%1:18:01:: employed there .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: was told that it was a sort---sort%1:09:00:: of hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: for white---white%1:18:00:: people---people%1:14:00:: , which seemed to him rather queer .
Why should a white hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: be set down in the center---center%1:15:01:: of Black Bottom---location%1:03:00:: ?
The rest---rest%1:24:00:: of Black Bottom---location%1:03:00:: was a rabbit warren---rabbit_warren%1:15:00:: of homes---home%1:06:00:: in every condition---condition%1:26:00:: of neglect---neglect%1:26:00:: , disrepair---disrepair%1:26:00:: and careful upkeep---upkeep%1:04:00:: .
Dives---dive%1:06:01:: , carefully repaired huts---hut%1:06:00:: , and nicely painted and ornamented cottages---cottage%1:06:00:: were jumbled together cheek by jowl with little distinction---distinction%1:09:00:: .
The yards---yard%1:06:02:: , front and back , were narrow ; some were trash dumps---trash_dump%1:15:00:: , some had flower gardens---flower_garden%1:06:00:: .
Behind were privies---privy%1:06:00:: , for there was no sewage system---sewage_system%1:06:00:: .
After looking about a bit , Wilson---person%1:03:00:: discovered beyond Black Bottom---location%1:03:00:: , across the river---river%1:17:00:: and far removed from the white---white%1:18:00:: city---city%1:15:00:: , a considerable tract---tract%1:15:00:: of land---land%1:17:01:: , and it occurred to him that the church---church%1:06:00:: and the better Negro---person%1:03:00:: homes---home%1:06:00:: might gradually be moved to this plot---plot%1:09:00:: .
He talked about it to the Presiding Elder---person%1:03:00:: .
The Presiding Elder---person%1:03:00:: looked him over rather carefully .
He was not sure what kind---kind%1:09:00:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: he had in hand .
But there was one thing---thing%1:09:02:: that he had to stress , and that was that the contribution---contribution%1:04:00:: to the general church---church%1:06:00:: expenses---expense%1:21:00:: , the dollar---dollar%1:23:00:: money---money%1:21:00:: , had been seriously falling behind in this church---church%1:06:00:: , and that must be looked after immediately .
In fact , he intimated clearly that that was the reason---reason%1:16:00:: that Wilson---person%1:03:00:: had been sent here - to make a larger contribution---contribution%1:04:00:: of dollar---dollar%1:23:00:: money---money%1:21:00:: .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: stressed the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that clear as this was , they must have a better church---church%1:06:00:: , a more business-like conduct---conduct%1:07:00:: of the church---church%1:14:00:: organization---organization%1:14:00:: , and an effort---effort%1:04:00:: to get this religious center---center%1:06:00:: out of its rut---rut%1:04:00:: of wild worship---worship%1:04:00:: into a modern church---church%1:14:00:: organization---organization%1:14:00:: .
He emphasized to the Presiding Elder---person%1:03:00:: the plan---plan%1:09:01:: of giving up---giving_up%1:10:00:: the old church---church%1:06:00:: and moving across the river---river%1:17:00:: .
The Presiding Elder---person%1:03:00:: was sure that that would be impossible .
But he told Wilson---person%1:03:00:: to `` go ahead and try '' .
And Wilson---person%1:03:00:: tried .
The bank---bank%1:14:00:: which held the mortgage---mortgage%1:21:00:: on the old church---church%1:06:00:: declared that the interest---interest%1:21:00:: was considerably in arrears , and the real estate---real_estate%1:21:00:: people---people%1:14:00:: said flatly that the land---land%1:21:01:: across the river---river%1:17:00:: was being held for an eventual development---development%1:15:00:: for white---white%1:18:00:: working people---people%1:14:00:: who were coming in , and that none would be sold to colored folk---folk%1:14:00:: .
When it was proposed to rebuild the church---church%1:06:00:: , Wilson---person%1:03:00:: found that the terms---terms%1:21:00:: for a new mortgage---mortgage%1:21:00:: were very high .
He was sure that he could do better if he went to Atlanta---location%1:03:00:: to get the deal---deal%1:04:02:: financed .
But when this proposal---proposal%1:10:00:: was made to his Deacon Board---group%1:03:00:: , he met unanimous opposition---opposition%1:04:00:: .
The church---church%1:06:00:: certainly would not be removed .
The very proposition---proposition%1:10:01:: was sacrilege---sacrilege%1:04:00:: .
It had been here fifty years---year%1:28:01:: .
It was hardly possible to get any argument---argument%1:10:03:: on the subject---subject%1:10:00:: .
As for rebuilding---rebuilding%1:04:00:: , well , that might be looked into , but there was no hurry---hurry%1:26:00:: , no hurry---hurry%1:26:00:: at all .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: again went downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: to a different banker---banker%1:18:00:: , an intelligent young white man---white_man%1:18:00:: who seemed rather sympathetic , but he shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
`` Reverend---person%1:03:00:: '' , he said , `` I think you do n't quite understand the situation---situation%1:26:00:: here .
Do n't you see the amount of money---amount_of_money%1:21:00:: that has been invested by whites---white%1:18:00:: around that church---church%1:06:00:: ?
Tenements---tenement%1:06:00:: , stores---store%1:06:00:: , saloons---saloon%1:06:00:: , some gambling---gambling%1:04:00:: , I hope not too much .
The colored people---people%1:14:00:: are getting employment---employment%1:04:00:: at Kent House---group%1:03:00:: and other places---place%1:15:00:: , and they are near their places---place%1:15:00:: of employment---employment%1:04:00:: .
When a city---city%1:15:01:: has arranged things---thing%1:26:00:: like this you cannot easily change them .
Now , if I were you I would just plan to repair---repair%1:04:00:: the old church---church%1:06:00:: so it would last for five or ten years---year%1:28:01:: .
By that time---time%1:11:00:: , perhaps something better can be done '' .
Then Wilson---person%1:03:00:: asked , `` What about this Kent House---group%1:03:00:: which you mention---mention%1:10:01:: ?
I do n't understand why a white hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: should be down here '' .
The young banker---banker%1:18:00:: looked at him with a certain surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: , and then he said flatly : `` I'm afraid I can't tell you anything in particular about Kent House---location%1:03:00:: .
And he dismissed the colored pastor---pastor%1:18:00:: .
It was next day---day%1:28:01:: that Sojourner---person%1:03:00:: came and sat beside him and took his hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
She said , `` My dear---dear%1:18:00:: , do you know what Kent House---location%1:03:00:: is '' ?
`` No '' , said Wilson---person%1:03:00:: , `` I do n't .
`` It 's a house of prostitution---house_of_prostitution%1:06:00:: for white men---white_man%1:18:00:: with white girls---girl%1:18:00:: as inmates---inmate%1:18:00:: .
They hire a good deal---good_deal%1:23:00:: of local labor---labor%1:14:00:: , including two members---member%1:18:00:: of our Trustee Board---group%1:03:00:: .
They buy some supplies from our colored grocers---grocer%1:18:00:: and they are patronized by some of the best white gentlemen---gentleman%1:18:00:: in town---town%1:15:00:: '' .
Wilson---person%1:03:00:: stared at her .
`` My dear---dear%1:18:00:: , you must be mistaken '' .
`` Talk to Mrs. Catt---person%1:03:00:: '' , she said .
And after Wilson---person%1:03:00:: had talked to Mrs. Catt---person%1:03:00:: and to others , he was absolutely amazed .
This , of course , was the sort---sort%1:09:00:: of thing---thing%1:11:00:: that used to take place in Southern cities---city%1:15:00:: - putting white houses of prostitution---house_of_prostitution%1:06:00:: colored girls---girl%1:18:00:: in colored neighborhoods---neighborhood%1:14:00:: and carrying them on openly .
But it had largely disappeared on account of protest---protest%1:04:00:: by the whites---white%1:18:00:: and through growing resentment---resentment%1:12:00:: on the part of the Negroes---person%1:03:00:: as they became more educated and got better wages---wage%1:21:00:: .
But this situation---situation%1:26:00:: of Kent House---group%1:03:00:: was more subtle .
The wages---wage%1:21:00:: involved were larger and more regular .
The inmates---inmate%1:18:00:: were white and from out of town---town%1:15:00:: , avoiding local friction---friction%1:26:00:: .
The backing---backing%1:04:00:: from the white town---town%1:14:00:: was greater and there was little publicity---publicity%1:10:00:: .
Good wages---wage%1:21:00:: , patronage---patronage%1:04:00:: and subscription---subscription%1:10:00:: of various kinds---kind%1:09:00:: stopped open protest---protest%1:04:00:: from Negroes---person%1:03:00:: .
And yet Wilson---person%1:03:00:: knew that this place---place%1:15:04:: must go or he must go .
And for him to leave this job---job%1:04:00:: now without accomplishing anything would mean practically the end---end%1:11:00:: of his career---career%1:04:00:: in the Methodist church---methodist_church%1:14:00:: , if not in all churches---church%1:06:00:: .
Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: is so persuasive that Voltaire---voltaire%1:18:00:: is almost convinced that he should burn his books---book%1:10:00:: , too .
But while the two men---man%1:18:00:: are riding into the country---country%1:15:00:: , where they are going to dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: , they are attacked in the dark---dark%1:26:00:: of the forest---forest%1:14:00:: by a band---band%1:14:01:: of thieves---thief%1:18:00:: , who strip them of everything , including most of their clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: .
`` You must be a very learned man---man%1:18:00:: '' , says Voltaire---voltaire%1:18:00:: to one of the bandits---bandit%1:18:00:: .
`` A learned man---man%1:18:00:: '' ? the bandit---bandit%1:18:00:: laughs in his face---face%1:08:00:: .
But Voltaire---voltaire%1:18:00:: perseveres .
He goes to the chief---chief%1:18:00:: himself .
`` At what university---university%1:06:00:: did you study '' ? he asks .
He refuses to believe that the bandit---bandit%1:18:00:: chief---chief%1:18:00:: never attended a higher institution---institution%1:14:00:: .
`` To have become so corrupt '' , he says , `` surely you must have studied many arts---arts%1:09:00:: and sciences '' .
The chief---chief%1:18:00:: , annoyed by these questions---question%1:10:00:: , knocks Voltaire---voltaire%1:18:00:: down and shouts at him that he not only never went to any school---school%1:14:00:: , but never even learned how to read .
When finally the two bedraggled men---man%1:18:00:: reach their friend---friend%1:18:00:: 's home---home%1:15:04:: , Voltaire---voltaire%1:18:00:: 's fears---fear%1:12:00:: are once again aroused .
For it is such a distinguished place---place%1:15:02:: , with such fine works of art---work_of_art%1:06:00:: and such a big library---library%1:06:00:: , that there can be little doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: but that the owner---owner%1:18:00:: has become depraved by all this culture---culture%1:09:00:: .
To Voltaire---voltaire%1:18:00:: 's surprise---surprise%1:12:00:: , however , their host---host%1:18:02:: gives them fresh clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: to put on , opens his purse---purse%1:06:02:: to lend them money---money%1:21:00:: and sits them down before a good dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: .
Immediately after dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: , however , Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: asks for still another favor---favor%1:04:00:: .
Could he have pen---pen%1:06:00:: and paper---paper%1:10:00:: , please ?
He is in a hurry---hurry%1:07:00:: to write another essay---essay%1:10:00:: against culture---culture%1:09:00:: .
Such was the impromptu---impromptu%1:10:00:: that Voltaire---voltaire%1:18:00:: gave to howls---howl%1:10:00:: of laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: at Sans Souci---location%1:03:00:: and that was soon circulated in manuscript---manuscript%1:10:00:: throughout the literary circles---circle%1:14:00:: of Europe---europe%1:17:00:: , to be printed sometime later , but with the name---name%1:10:00:: of Timon of Athens---person%1:03:00:: , the famous misanthrope---misanthrope%1:18:00:: , substituted for that of Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: .
How could the rich , for whom life---life%1:09:00:: was made so simple , ever understand the subterfuges---subterfuge%1:10:00:: , the lies---lie%1:10:00:: , the frauds---fraud%1:04:01:: , the errors---error%1:07:01:: , sins---sin%1:04:00:: and even crimes---crime%1:04:00:: to which the poor were driven in their efforts---effort%1:04:00:: to overcome the great advantages---advantage%1:07:00:: the rich had in the race---race%1:11:01:: of life---life%1:09:00:: ?
How , for example , could a Voltaire---voltaire%1:18:00:: understand the strange predicament---predicament%1:26:00:: in which a Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: would find himself when , soon after the furor---furor%1:09:00:: of his first Discourse---discourse%1:10:01:: , he acquired still another title---title%1:07:00:: to fame---fame%1:26:01:: ?
This time---time%1:11:00:: as a musician---musician%1:18:01:: .
As a composer---composer%1:18:00:: .
Ever since he had first begun to study music---music%1:10:00:: and to teach it , Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: had dreamed of piercing through to fame---fame%1:26:01:: as the result---result%1:19:00:: of a successful opera---opera%1:10:00:: .
But his facility in this genre---genre%1:09:00:: was not great .
And his efforts---effort%1:04:00:: to get a performance---performance%1:10:00:: for his Gallant Muses invariably failed .
And for good reasons---reason%1:16:00:: .
His operatic music---music%1:10:00:: had little merit---merit%1:07:01:: .
But then one day---day%1:28:03:: , while on a week---week%1:28:00:: 's visit---visit%1:04:02:: to the country---country%1:15:00:: home---home%1:06:00:: of a retired Swiss jeweler---jeweler%1:18:01:: , Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: amused the company---company%1:14:00:: with a few little melodies---melody%1:10:00:: he had written , to which he attached no great importance---importance%1:07:00:: .
He was really amazed to discover the other guests---guest%1:18:00:: so excited about these delicate little songs---song%1:10:00:: .
`` Put a few such songs---song%1:10:00:: together '' , they urged him .
`` String them onto some sort---sort%1:09:00:: of little plot---plot%1:10:00:: , and you 'll have a delightful operetta---operetta%1:10:00:: '' .
`` Nonsense---nonsense%1:10:00:: '' , he said .
`` This is the sort---sort%1:09:00:: of stuff---stuff%1:10:00:: I write and then throw away '' !
`` Heaven forbid '' ! cried the ladies---lady%1:18:02:: , enchanted by his music---music%1:10:00:: .
`` You must make an opera---opera%1:10:00:: out of this material---material%1:10:00:: '' .
Oh , the irony---irony%1:07:00:: and the bitterness---bitterness%1:12:00:: of it !
That after all his years---year%1:28:01:: of effort---effort%1:04:01:: to become a composer---composer%1:18:00:: , he should now , now when he was still stoutly replying to the critics---critic%1:18:01:: of his Discourse on the Arts and Sciences , be so close to a success---success%1:18:00:: in music---music%1:10:00:: and have to reject it .
You could n't on the one hand decry the arts---art%1:06:00:: and at the same time practice---practice%1:04:03:: them , could you ?
Well , yes , perhaps in literature---literature%1:10:00:: , since you could argue that you could n't keep silent about your feelings---feeling%1:09:03:: against literature---literature%1:10:00:: and so were involved in spite of yourself .
But now music---music%1:10:00:: too ?
And the fault---fault%1:04:00:: , of course , was Rameau---person%1:03:00:: 's .
The fault---fault%1:04:00:: was Rameau---person%1:03:00:: 's and that of the whole culture---culture%1:09:00:: of this Parisian age---age%1:28:02:: .
For it was Rameau---person%1:03:00:: 's type---type%1:09:00:: of music---music%1:10:00:: that he had been trying to write , and that he could n't write .
These little songs---song%1:10:00:: , however , were sweet nothings---sweet_nothings%1:10:00:: from the heart , tender memories---memory%1:09:02:: of his childhood---childhood%1:28:00:: , little melodies---melody%1:10:00:: that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep .
He could n't appear as a composer---composer%1:18:00:: now .
That glory---glory%1:26:00:: , craved for so long , was now forbidden to him .
Still , just for the ladies---lady%1:18:02:: , and just for this once , for this one weekend---weekend%1:28:00:: in the country---country%1:15:01:: , he would make a little piece---piece%1:10:01:: out of his melodies---melody%1:10:00:: .
The ladies---lady%1:18:02:: were delighted and Jean Jacques---person%1:03:00:: was applauded .
And everyone went to work to learn the parts---part%1:10:00:: which he wrote .
But then , after the little operetta---operetta%1:10:00:: had been given its feeble amateur rendering---rendering%1:10:01:: , everyone insisted that it was too good to be lost forever , and that the Royal Academy of Music---group%1:03:00:: must now have the manuscript---manuscript%1:10:00:: in order to give it the really first-rate performance---performance%1:10:00:: it merited .
Rousseau---person%1:03:00:: was aware that he must seem like a hypocrite---hypocrite%1:18:00:: , standing there and arguing that he could not possibly permit a public performance---performance%1:10:00:: .
The ladies---lady%1:18:02:: especially could n't understand what troubled him .
A contradiction---contradiction%1:24:00:: ?
Bah , what was a contradiction---contradiction%1:24:00:: in one 's life---life%1:26:02:: ?
Every woman---woman%1:18:00:: has had the experience---experience%1:09:01:: of saying no---no%1:10:00:: when she meant yes---yes%1:10:00:: , and saying yes---yes%1:10:00:: when she meant no---no%1:10:00:: .
Rousseau---person%1:03:00:: had to admit that though he could n't agree to a public performance---performance%1:10:00:: , he would indeed , just for his own private satisfaction---satisfaction%1:12:00:: , dearly love to know how his work---work%1:06:00:: would sound when done by professional musicians---musician%1:18:01:: and by trained voices---voice%1:18:01:: .
`` I 'd simply like to know if it is as good as you kind people---people%1:14:00:: seem to think '' , he said .
Duclos---person%1:03:00:: , the historian---historian%1:18:00:: , pointed out to Jean Jacques---person%1:03:00:: that this was impossible .
The musicians---musician%1:18:01:: of the Royal Opera---group%1:03:00:: would not rehearse a work---work%1:06:00:: merely to see how it would sound .
Merely to satisfy the author---author%1:18:01:: 's curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: .
Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: agreed .
But he recalled that Rameau---person%1:03:00:: had once had a private performance---performance%1:10:00:: of his opera---opera%1:10:00:: Armide , behind closed doors---door%1:06:00:: , just for himself alone .
Duclos---person%1:03:00:: understood what was bothering Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: : that the writer---writer%1:18:00:: of the Prosopopoeia of Fabricius should now become known as the writer---writer%1:18:00:: of an amusing little operetta---operetta%1:10:00:: .
But Duclos---person%1:03:00:: thought he saw a way out---way_out%1:06:00:: .
`` Let me do the submitting to the Royal Academy---group%1:03:00:: '' , he suggested .
`` Your name---name%1:10:00:: will never appear .
No one will even suspect that it is your work---work%1:06:00:: '' .
To that Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: could agree .
But now what crazy twists---twist%1:11:00:: and turns---turn%1:11:01:: of his emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: !
Afraid at one and the same time---time%1:11:00:: that his work---work%1:06:00:: might be turned down - which would be a blow---blow%1:04:01:: to his pride---pride%1:07:00:: even though no one knew he was the author---author%1:18:00:: - and that the work---work%1:06:00:: would be accepted , and then that his violent feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: in the matter---matter%1:09:01:: would certainly betray how deeply concerned he was in spite of himself .
And how anxious this lover---lover%1:18:00:: of obscurity---obscurity%1:26:00:: was for applause---applause%1:10:00:: !
And thus torn between his desire---desire%1:12:00:: to be known as the composer---composer%1:18:00:: of a successful opera---opera%1:10:00:: and the necessity---necessity%1:26:00:: of remaining true to his proclaimed desire---desire%1:07:00:: for anonymity---anonymity%1:26:00:: , Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: suffered through several painful weeks---week%1:28:00:: .
All these emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: were screwed up to new heights---height%1:07:00:: when , after acceptance---acceptance%1:04:00:: and the first rehearsals---rehearsal%1:04:01:: , there ensued such a buzz---buzz%1:04:00:: of excitement---excitement%1:12:00:: among Parisian music lovers---music_lover%1:18:00:: that Duclos---person%1:03:00:: had to come running to Rousseau---rousseau%1:18:00:: to inform him that the news---news%1:10:01:: had reached the superintendent---superintendent%1:18:00:: of the King---king%1:18:00:: 's amusements---amusement%1:04:00:: , and that he was now demanding that the work---work%1:06:00:: be offered first at the royal summer---summer%1:28:00:: palace---palace%1:06:01:: of Fontainebleau---location%1:03:00:: .
Imagine the honor---honor%1:26:00:: of it !
`` What was your answer---answer%1:10:01:: '' ?
Jean Jacques---person%1:03:00:: asked , striving to appear unimpressed .
`` I refused '' , Duclos---person%1:03:00:: said .
Monsieur de Cury---person%1:03:00:: was incensed , of course .
But I said I would first have to get the author---author%1:18:01:: 's permission---permission%1:10:00:: .
Why had not this success---success%1:04:00:: come to him before he had plunged into his Discourse , and before he had committed himself to a life---life%1:26:01:: of austerity---austerity%1:07:01:: and denial---denial%1:22:00:: ?
Now , when everything was opening up to him - even the court---court%1:14:00:: of Louis / 15---person%1:03:00:: 15 , !
- he had to play a role---role%1:04:00:: of self-effacement---self-effacement%1:04:00:: .
Back and forth Duclos---person%1:03:00:: had to go , between M. de Cury---person%1:03:00:: and Jean Jacques---person%1:03:00:: and between the Duke d'Aumont---person%1:03:00:: and Jean Jacques---person%1:03:00:: again , as his little operetta---operetta%1:10:00:: , The Village Soothsayer , though still unperformed , took on ever more importance---importance%1:26:00:: .
And of course the news---news%1:10:01:: of who the composer---composer%1:18:00:: was did finally begin to get around among his closest friends---friend%1:18:00:: .
But they , naturally , kept his secret---secret%1:10:00:: well , and the public---public%1:14:00:: at large knew only of a great excitement---excitement%1:12:00:: in musical and court---court%1:14:00:: circles---circle%1:14:00:: .
How titillating it was to go among people---people%1:14:00:: who did not know him as the composer---composer%1:18:00:: , but who talked in the most glowing terms---term%1:10:00:: of the promise---promise%1:09:00:: of the piece---piece%1:10:01:: after having heard the first rehearsals---rehearsal%1:04:01:: .
The furor---furor%1:09:00:: was such that people---people%1:14:00:: who could not possibly have squirmed their way---way%1:23:00:: into the rehearsals---rehearsal%1:04:01:: were pretending that they were intimate with the whole affair---affair%1:11:00:: and that it would be sensational .
And listening to such a conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: one morning---morning%1:28:00:: while taking a cup---cup%1:23:01:: of chocolate---chocolate%1:13:02:: in a cafe---cafe%1:06:00:: , Rousseau---person%1:03:00:: found himself bathed in perspiration---perspiration%1:08:00:: , trembling lest his authorship---authorship%1:04:00:: become known , and at the same time dreaming of the startling effect---effect%1:09:00:: he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly as the composer---composer%1:18:00:: .
He felt himself now , as he himself says in his Confessions , at a crucial point---point%1:28:00:: of his life---life%1:26:02:: .
And that was why , on the day---day%1:28:01:: of the performance---performance%1:10:00:: , when a carriage---carriage%1:06:01:: from the royal stables---stable%1:06:00:: called to take him to the palace---palace%1:06:01:: , he did not bother to shave .
On the contrary , he was pleased that his face---face%1:08:00:: showed a neglect---neglect%1:04:02:: of several days---day%1:28:00:: .
Seeing him in that condition---condition%1:26:00:: , and about to enter the hall---hall%1:06:06:: where the King---person%1:03:00:: , the Queen---queen%1:18:01:: , the whole royal family---royal_family%1:14:00:: and all the members---member%1:18:00:: of the highest aristocracy---aristocracy%1:14:01:: would be present , Grimm---person%1:03:00:: and the Abbe Raynal---person%1:03:00:: and others tried to stop him .
`` You can n't go in that way---way%1:07:01:: '' ! they cried .
Jean Jacques---person%1:03:00:: asked .
`` You have n't dressed for the occasion---occasion%1:11:01:: '' ! they pointed out to him .
`` I'm dressed as I always am '' , Rousseau---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` At home---home%1:06:00:: , yes '' , they argued .
`` At home---home%1:15:04:: , yes---yes%1:10:00:: '' , they argued .
`` But here you are in the palace---palace%1:06:01:: .
There 's the King---king%1:18:00:: .
And Madame de Pompadour---person%1:03:00:: '' .
`` If they are here , then surely I have the right---right%1:07:00:: to be here '' , Rousseau---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` And even more right---right%1:07:00:: .
Since I am the composer---composer%1:18:00:: '' !
`` But in such a slovenly condition---condition%1:26:00:: '' .
Rousseau---person%1:03:00:: asked .
`` Is it because of my slovenliness---slovenliness%1:26:00:: that hair---hair%1:08:00:: grows on my face---face%1:08:00:: ?
A hundred years---year%1:28:01:: ago I would have worn a beard---beard%1:08:00:: with pride .
And those without beards---beard%1:08:00:: would have stood out as not dressed for the occasion---occasion%1:11:01:: .
Now---now%1:28:00:: times---times%1:28:01:: have changed , and I must pretend that hair---hair%1:08:00:: does n't grow on my face---face%1:08:00:: .
That 's the fashion---fashion%1:09:00:: .
And fashion---fashion%1:04:00:: is the real king---king%1:18:00:: here .
Not Louis / 15---person%1:03:00:: , , since even he obeys .
Now---now%1:28:00:: , if you do n't mind , I should like to hear my own piece---piece%1:10:01:: performed '' .
But of course behind his boldness---boldness%1:07:00:: he did n't feel bold at all .
He trembled lest his piece---piece%1:10:01:: should fail .
And this in addition to his usual fear---fear%1:12:00:: of being among people---people%1:14:00:: of high society---high_society%1:14:00:: .
His fear---fear%1:12:00:: of making some inane or inappropriate remark---remark%1:10:00:: .
his fear---fear%1:12:00:: lest in this closed hall---hall%1:06:06:: he should suddenly itch to relieve himself .
Could he walk out in the midst of his piece---piece%1:10:01:: ?
Here , before the court---court%1:14:00:: ?
Before the King---king%1:18:00:: ?
As cells---cell%1:03:00:: coalesced into organisms---organism%1:03:00:: , they built new `` unnatural '' and internally controlled environments---environment%1:26:00:: to cope even more successfully with the entropy increasing properties---property%1:07:00:: of the external world---world%1:17:00:: .
The useful suggestion---suggestion%1:09:00:: of Professor David Hawkins---person%1:03:00:: which considers culture---culture%1:14:00:: as a third stage---stage%1:26:00:: in biological evolution---evolution%1:22:01:: fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion---suggestion%1:09:00:: that science has provided us with a rather successful technique---technique%1:09:00:: for building protective artificial environments---environment%1:15:00:: .
One wonders about its applicability---applicability%1:24:00:: to people---people%1:14:00:: .
Will advances---advance%1:11:01:: in human sciences---science%1:09:00:: help us build social structures---social_structure%1:14:00:: and governments---government%1:09:00:: which will enable us to cope with people---people%1:14:00:: as effectively as the primitive combination of protein---protein%1:27:00:: and nucleic acid---nucleic_acid%1:27:00:: built a structure---structure%1:06:00:: of molecules---molecule%1:27:00:: which enabled it to adapt to a sea---sea%1:17:00:: of molecular interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: ?
The answer---answer%1:10:00:: is of course yes .
For the family---family%1:14:00:: is the simplest example---example%1:09:02:: of just such a unit---unit%1:17:00:: , composed of people---people%1:14:00:: , which gives us both some immunity---immunity%1:26:00:: from , and a way---way%1:04:01:: of dealing with , other people---people%1:14:00:: .
Social invention---invention%1:06:00:: did not have to await social theory---theory%1:09:00:: any more than use---use%1:04:00:: of the warmth---warmth%1:09:00:: of a fire---fire%1:06:00:: had to await Lavoisier---person%1:03:00:: or the buoyant protection---protection%1:21:00:: of a boat---boat%1:06:00:: the formulations---formulation%1:04:00:: of Archimedes---person%1:03:00:: .
But it has been during the last two centuries---century%1:28:00:: , during the scientific revolution---revolution%1:11:01:: , that our independence---independence%1:26:00:: from the physical environment---environment%1:26:00:: has made the most rapid strides---stride%1:23:00:: .
We have ample light---light%1:26:00:: when the sun---sun%1:17:00:: sets ; the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: of our homes---home%1:06:00:: is independent of the seasons---season%1:28:00:: ; we fly through the air---air%1:15:00:: , although gravity---gravity%1:19:00:: pulls us down ; the range---range%1:07:00:: of our voice---voice%1:10:00:: ignores distance---distance%1:07:01:: .
At what stage---stage%1:26:00:: are social sciences---social_science%1:09:00:: then ?
Is the future---future%1:28:00:: of psychology---psychology%1:09:00:: akin to the rich future---future%1:28:00:: of physics---physics%1:09:00:: at the time---time%1:28:00:: of Newton---newton%1:18:00:: ?
There is a haunting resemblance---resemblance%1:07:00:: between the notion---notion%1:09:00:: of cause---cause%1:11:00:: in Copernicus---person%1:03:00:: and in Freud---freud%1:18:00:: .
And it is certainly no slight---slight%1:04:00:: to either of them to compare both their achievements---achievement%1:04:00:: and their impact---impact%1:19:00:: .
Political theoretical understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: , although almost at a standstill---standstill%1:26:00:: during this century---century%1:28:00:: , did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries---century%1:28:00:: , and resulted in a flood---flood%1:04:01:: of inventions---invention%1:06:00:: which increased the possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: for man to coexist with man .
Constitutional government---government%1:14:00:: , popular vote---vote%1:04:01:: , trial by jury---jury%1:14:00:: , public education---education%1:09:00:: , labor unions---labor_union%1:14:00:: , cooperatives---cooperative%1:14:00:: , communes---commune%1:14:00:: , socialized ownership---ownership%1:21:00:: , world courts---world_court%1:14:00:: , and the veto---veto%1:04:00:: power---power%1:07:00:: in world councils---world_council%1:14:00:: are but a few examples---example%1:09:01:: .
Most of these , with horrible exceptions---exception%1:09:00:: , were conceived as is a ship---ship%1:06:00:: , not as an attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to quell the ocean---ocean%1:17:00:: of mankind , nor to deny its force---force%1:07:01:: , but as a means---means%1:04:00:: to survive and enjoy it .
The most effective political inventions---invention%1:06:00:: seem to make maximum use---use%1:04:00:: of natural harbors---harbor%1:15:00:: and are aware that restraining breakwaters---breakwater%1:06:00:: can play only a minor part---part%1:04:01:: in the whole scheme---scheme%1:09:00:: .
Just as present technology---technology%1:09:00:: had to await the explanations---explanation%1:09:00:: of physics---physics%1:09:00:: , so one might expect that social invention---invention%1:06:00:: will follow growing sociological understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: .
We are desperately in the need---need%1:26:00:: of such invention---invention%1:04:00:: , for man is still very much at the mercy---mercy%1:04:00:: of man .
In fact the accumulation---accumulation%1:22:00:: of the hardware---hardware%1:06:02:: of destruction---destruction%1:11:00:: is day by day increasing our fear---fear%1:12:00:: of each other .
I want , therefore , to discuss a second and quite different fruit---fruit%1:06:00:: of science , the connection---connection%1:24:00:: between scientific understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: and fear---fear%1:12:00:: .
There are certainly large areas---area%1:09:00:: of understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: in the human sciences---science%1:09:00:: which in themselves and even without political invention---invention%1:04:00:: can help to dispel our present fears---fear%1:12:00:: .
Lucretius---person%1:03:00:: has remarked : `` The reason---reason%1:16:00:: why all Mortals---mortal%1:03:00:: are so gripped by fear---fear%1:12:00:: is that they see all sorts---sort%1:09:00:: of things---thing%1:11:00:: happening in the earth---earth%1:17:01:: and sky---sky%1:17:00:: with no discernable cause---cause%1:11:00:: , and these they attribute to the will---will%1:09:01:: of God---god%1:18:00:: '' .
Perhaps things---thing%1:26:00:: were even worse then .
It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears---fear%1:12:00:: of man .
We get some clue---clue%1:10:00:: from a few remembrances---remembrance%1:09:00:: of childhood---childhood%1:28:00:: and from the circumstance---circumstance%1:26:01:: that we are probably not much more afraid of people---people%1:14:00:: now than man---man%1:05:01:: ever was .
We are not now afraid of atomic bombs---atomic_bomb%1:06:00:: in the same way---way%1:07:01:: that people---people%1:14:00:: once feared comets---comet%1:17:00:: .
The bombs---bomb%1:06:00:: are as harmless as an automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: in a garage---garage%1:06:00:: .
We are worried about what people---people%1:14:00:: may do with them - that some crazy fool---fool%1:18:00:: may `` push the button---button%1:06:01:: '' .
I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears---fear%1:12:00:: , but there are certain features---feature%1:09:00:: of the fears---fear%1:12:00:: dispelled by scientific explanations---explanation%1:10:00:: that stand out quite clearly .
They are in general those fears---fear%1:12:00:: that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer---prayer%1:04:00:: or ritual---ritual%1:04:01:: .
They include both individual fears---fear%1:12:00:: and collective ones .
They arise in situations---situation%1:26:00:: in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world---world%1:17:00:: , but also on the precise pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: of behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: of the individual---individual%1:03:00:: or group---group%1:03:00:: .
Often it is recognized that all the details---detail%1:09:00:: of the pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: may not be essential to the outcome---outcome%1:19:00:: but , because the pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: , one is never quite certain which behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: elements---element%1:09:00:: are effective , and the whole pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: becomes ritualized .
Yet often fear---fear%1:12:00:: persists because , even with the most rigid ritual---ritual%1:04:01:: , one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: that one might make some mistake---mistake%1:04:00:: or that in every previous execution---execution%1:04:02:: one had been unaware of the really decisive act---act%1:03:00:: .
To say that science had reduced many such fears---fear%1:12:00:: merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement---statement%1:10:00:: that science eliminated much of magic---magic%1:09:00:: and superstition---superstition%1:09:00:: .
But a somewhat more detailed analysis---analysis%1:04:00:: of this process---process%1:04:00:: may be illuminating .
The frequently postulated antique worry---worry%1:09:00:: that the daylight---daylight%1:28:00:: hours---hour%1:28:00:: might dwindle to complete darkness---darkness%1:26:00:: apparently gave rise to a ritual---ritual%1:04:00:: and celebration---celebration%1:11:00:: which we still recognize .
It is curious that even centuries---century%1:28:00:: of repetition---repetition%1:11:00:: of the yearly cycle---cycle%1:11:01:: did not induce a sufficient degree---degree%1:07:00:: of confidence---confidence%1:12:00:: to allow people---people%1:14:00:: to abandon the ceremonies---ceremony%1:11:00:: of the winter solstice---winter_solstice%1:28:00:: .
This and other fears---fear%1:12:00:: of the solar system---solar_system%1:17:00:: have disappeared gradually , first , with the Ptolemaic system---ptolemaic_system%1:09:00:: and its built-in concept---concept%1:09:00:: of periodicity---periodicity%1:07:00:: and then , more firmly , with the Newtonian innovation---innovation%1:06:00:: of an universal force---force%1:19:00:: that could account quantitatively for both terrestrial and celestial motions---motion%1:11:00:: .
This understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: provides a very simple example---example%1:09:02:: of the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that one can eliminate fear---fear%1:12:00:: without instituting any controls---control%1:24:00:: .
In fact , although we have dispelled the fear---fear%1:12:00:: , we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers---danger%1:26:01:: .
There is still the remote possibility---possibility%1:09:03:: of planetoid---planetoid%1:17:00:: collision---collision%1:11:01:: .
A meteor---meteor%1:17:00:: could fall on San Francisco---san_francisco%1:15:00:: .
Solar activities---activity%1:26:00:: could presumably bring long periods---period%1:28:00:: of flood---flood%1:19:00:: or drought---drought%1:26:00:: .
Our understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of the solar system---solar_system%1:17:00:: has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals---ritual%1:04:00:: with the appropriate action---action%1:04:02:: which , in this case---case%1:26:00:: , amounts to doing nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
This almost trivial example---example%1:09:02:: is nevertheless suggestive , for there are some elements---element%1:09:00:: in common between the antique fear---fear%1:12:00:: that the days---day%1:28:02:: would get shorter and shorter and our present fear---fear%1:12:00:: of war---war%1:26:00:: .
We , in our country---country%1:14:00:: , think of war---war%1:26:00:: as an external threat---threat%1:26:00:: which , if it occurs , will not be primarily of our own doing .
And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance---avoidance%1:04:00:: of the disaster---disaster%1:26:00:: depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way---way%1:07:01:: on the details---detail%1:09:00:: of how we behave .
What elements---element%1:09:00:: of our behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: are decisive ?
Our weapons---weapon%1:06:00:: production---production%1:04:00:: , our world prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: , our ideas---idea%1:09:00:: of democracy---democracy%1:09:00:: , our actions---action%1:04:02:: of trust---trust%1:07:00:: or stubbornness---stubbornness%1:07:01:: or secrecy---secrecy%1:07:02:: or espionage---espionage%1:04:00:: ?
We have staved off a war---war%1:26:00:: and , since our behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: has involved all these elements---element%1:09:00:: , we can only keep adding to our ritual---ritual%1:04:00:: without daring to abandon any part---part%1:24:00:: of it , since we have not the slightest notion---notion%1:09:02:: which parts---part%1:24:00:: are effective .
I think that we are here also talking of the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of fear---fear%1:12:00:: that a young boy---boy%1:18:00:: has for a group---group%1:03:00:: of boys---boy%1:18:00:: who are approaching at night---night%1:28:00:: along the streets---street%1:06:00:: of a large city---city%1:15:00:: .
If an automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: were approaching him , he would know what was required of him , even though he might not be able to act quickly enough .
With the group---group%1:03:00:: of boys---boy%1:18:00:: it is different .
He does not know whether to look up or look aside , to put his hands---hand%1:08:00:: in his pockets---pocket%1:25:00:: or to clench them at his side---side%1:15:02:: , to cross the street---street%1:06:00:: , or to continue on the same side---side%1:15:02:: .
When confronted with a drunk---drunk%1:18:00:: or an insane person---person%1:03:00:: I have no notion---notion%1:09:02:: of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others .
I believe that what I do has some effect---effect%1:19:00:: on his actions---action%1:04:02:: and I have learned , in a way , to commune with drunks---drunk%1:18:00:: , but certainly my actions---action%1:04:02:: seem to resemble more nearly the performance---performance%1:10:00:: of a rain dance---rain_dance%1:04:00:: than the carrying out of an experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: in physics---physics%1:09:00:: .
I am usually filled with an uneasiness---uneasiness%1:12:02:: that through some unwitting slip---slip%1:04:05:: all hell---hell%1:15:01:: may break loose .
Our inability---inability%1:09:00:: to explain why certain people---people%1:14:00:: are fond of us frequently induces the same kind---kind%1:09:00:: of ritual---ritual%1:04:00:: and malaise---malaise%1:26:00:: .
We are forced , in our behavior---behavior%1:07:00:: towards others , to adopt empirically successful patterns---pattern%1:04:00:: in toto because we have such a minimal understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of their essential elements---element%1:09:00:: .
Our collective policies---policy%1:09:00:: , group---group%1:03:00:: and national , are similarly based on voodoo---voodoo%1:06:00:: , but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals---ritual%1:04:01:: and are still engaged in determining them .
We use terms---term%1:10:00:: from our personal experience---experience%1:09:00:: with individuals---individual%1:03:00:: such as `` trust---trust%1:07:00:: '' , `` cheat '' , and `` get tough '' .
We talk about national character---character%1:07:01:: in the same way---way%1:07:01:: that Copernicus---person%1:03:00:: talked of the compulsions---compulsion%1:16:00:: of celestial bodies---celestial_body%1:17:00:: to move in circles---circle%1:25:00:: .
We perform elaborate international exhortations---exhortation%1:10:01:: and ceremonies---ceremony%1:04:00:: with virtually no understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of social cause---cause%1:10:00:: and effect---effect%1:19:00:: .
Small wonder---wonder%1:11:00:: , then , that we fear .
The achievements---achievement%1:04:00:: which dispelled our fears---fear%1:12:00:: of the cosmos---cosmos%1:17:00:: took place three centuries---century%1:28:00:: ago .
What additional roles---role%1:04:00:: has the scientific understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of the 19th and 20th centuries---century%1:28:00:: played ?
In the physical sciences---physical_science%1:09:00:: , these achievements---achievement%1:04:00:: concern electricity---electricity%1:19:00:: , chemistry---chemistry%1:09:00:: , and atomic physics---atomic_physics%1:09:00:: .
In the life sciences---life_science%1:09:00:: , there has been an enormous increase---increase%1:11:00:: in our understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of disease---disease%1:26:00:: , in the mechanisms---mechanism%1:04:00:: of heredity---heredity%1:22:00:: , and in bio - and physiological chemistry---chemistry%1:09:00:: .
The major effect---effect%1:19:00:: of these advances---advance%1:11:01:: appears to lie in the part---part%1:09:02:: they have played in the industrial revolution---industrial_revolution%1:28:00:: and in the tools---tool%1:04:00:: which scientific understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment---environment%1:26:00:: .
In addition , our way---way%1:04:00:: of dealing directly with natural phenomena---natural_phenomenon%1:19:00:: has also changed .
Even in domains---domain%1:26:00:: where detailed and predictive understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: is still lacking , but where some explanations---explanation%1:10:00:: are possible , as with lightning---lightning%1:19:00:: and weather---weather%1:19:00:: and earthquakes---earthquake%1:11:00:: , the appropriate kind---kind%1:09:00:: of human action---human_action%1:03:00:: has been more adequately indicated .
Apparently the population---population%1:14:01:: as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence---confidence%1:09:00:: in the explanations---explanation%1:10:00:: of the scientists---scientist%1:18:00:: to modify its procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: and its fears---fear%1:12:00:: .
How and why this process---process%1:04:00:: occurs would provide an interesting separate subject---subject%1:10:00:: for study .
In some areas---area%1:09:00:: , the progress---progress%1:04:00:: is slower than in others .
In agriculture---agriculture%1:04:00:: , for example , despite the advances---advance%1:11:01:: in biology---biology%1:09:00:: , elaborate rituals---ritual%1:04:00:: tend to persist along with a continued sense---sense%1:09:05:: of the imminence---imminence%1:26:00:: of some natural disaster---disaster%1:26:00:: .
In child care---child_care%1:04:00:: , the opposite extreme---extreme%1:15:00:: prevails ; procedures---procedure%1:04:02:: change rapidly and parental confidence---confidence%1:09:00:: probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory---theory%1:09:00:: .
There are many domains---domain%1:26:00:: in which understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: in ritual---ritual%1:04:00:: and fear---fear%1:12:00:: .
Much of the former extreme---extreme%1:15:00:: uneasiness---uneasiness%1:12:02:: associated with visions---vision%1:09:03:: and hallucinations---hallucination%1:26:00:: and with death---death%1:28:00:: has disappeared .
The persistent horror---horror%1:12:01:: of having a malformed child---child%1:18:01:: has , I believe , been reduced , not because we have gained any control---control%1:24:00:: over this misfortune---misfortune%1:11:00:: , but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control---control%1:24:00:: over it .
In fact , the recent warnings---warning%1:10:01:: about the use---use%1:04:00:: of X-rays---x_ray%1:19:00:: have introduced fears---fear%1:12:00:: and ambiguities---ambiguity%1:07:00:: of action---action%1:04:02:: which now require more detailed understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: , and thus in this instance---instance%1:11:00:: , science has momentarily aggravated our fears---fear%1:12:00:: .
In fact , insofar as science generates any fear---fear%1:12:00:: , it stems not so much from scientific prowess---prowess%1:09:00:: and gadgets---gadget%1:06:00:: but from the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that new unanswered questions---question%1:10:03:: arise , which , until they are understood , create uncertainty---uncertainty%1:09:00:: .
Perhaps the most illuminating example---example%1:09:02:: of the reduction---reduction%1:04:00:: of fear---fear%1:12:00:: through understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: is derived from our increased knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of disease---disease%1:26:00:: .
The situation---situation%1:26:00:: with regard to our attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: and `` control---control%1:24:00:: '' of disease---disease%1:26:00:: contains close analogies---analogy%1:09:00:: to problems---problem%1:26:00:: confronting us with respect to people---people%1:14:00:: .
The fear---fear%1:12:00:: of disease---disease%1:26:00:: was formerly very much the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of fear---fear%1:12:00:: I have tried to describe .
These societies---society%1:14:00:: can expect to face difficult times---time%1:28:00:: .
As the historic processes---process%1:04:00:: of modernization---modernization%1:04:00:: gradually gain momentum---momentum%1:07:00:: , their cohesion---cohesion%1:26:00:: will be threatened by divisive forces---force%1:14:00:: , the gaps---gap%1:07:00:: between rulers---ruler%1:18:00:: and subjects---subject%1:18:00:: , town---town%1:15:00:: and country---country%1:14:00:: , will widen ; new aspirants---aspirant%1:18:00:: for power---power%1:07:00:: will emerge whose ambitions---ambition%1:12:00:: far exceed their competence---competence%1:07:00:: ; old rulers---ruler%1:18:00:: may lose their nerve---nerve%1:07:00:: and their sense of direction---sense_of_direction%1:09:00:: .
National leaders---national_leader%1:18:00:: will have to display the highest skills---skill%1:09:00:: of statesmanship---statesmanship%1:07:00:: to guide their people---people%1:14:00:: through times---time%1:28:00:: of uncertainty---uncertainty%1:07:00:: and confusion---confusion%1:26:01:: which destroy men 's sense of identity---identity%1:07:00:: .
Feelings---feeling%1:26:00:: of a community---community%1:26:00:: of interest---interest%1:09:00:: will have to be recreated - in some of the new nations---nation%1:14:00:: , indeed , they must be built for the first time - on a new basis---basis%1:09:00:: which looks toward the future---future%1:28:00:: and does not rely only on shared memories---memory%1:09:02:: of the past---past%1:28:00:: .
Nevertheless , with foresight---foresight%1:07:00:: and careful planning---planning%1:04:00:: , some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: of social change---change%1:04:00:: which have troubled other countries---country%1:14:00:: passing through this stage---stage%1:28:00:: can be escaped .
The United States---united_states%1:15:00:: can help by communicating a genuine concern---concern%1:12:00:: with the problems---problem%1:26:00:: these countries---country%1:14:00:: face and a readiness---readiness%1:09:00:: to provide technical and other appropriate forms---form%1:09:01:: of assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: where possible .
Our central goal---goal%1:09:00:: should be to provide the greatest positive incentive---incentive%1:16:00:: for these societies---society%1:14:00:: to tackle boldly the tasks---task%1:04:01:: which they face .
At the same time , we should recognize that the obstacles---obstacle%1:09:00:: to change---change%1:04:00:: and the lack---lack%1:26:00:: of cohesion---cohesion%1:26:00:: and stability---stability%1:07:00:: which characterize these countries---country%1:14:00:: may make them particularly prone to diversions---diversion%1:04:01:: and external adventures---adventure%1:04:00:: of all sorts---sort%1:09:00:: .
It may seem to some of them that success---success%1:26:00:: can be purchased much less dearly by fishing in the murky waters---water%1:17:00:: of international politics---politics%1:24:00:: than by facing up to the intractable tasks---task%1:04:01:: at home---at_home%1:14:00:: .
We should do what we can to discourage this conclusion---conclusion%1:11:00:: , both by offering assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: for their domestic needs---need%1:17:00:: and by reacting firmly to irresponsible actions---action%1:04:02:: on the world scene---scene%1:15:00:: .
When necessary , we should make it clear that countries---country%1:14:00:: which choose to derive marginal advantages---advantage%1:07:00:: from the cold war---cold_war%1:26:00:: or to exploit their potential---potential%1:26:00:: for disrupting the security---security%1:26:00:: of the world will not only lose our sympathy---sympathy%1:24:00:: but also risk their own prospects---prospect%1:26:00:: for orderly development---development%1:22:02:: .
As a nation---nation%1:14:00:: , we feel an obligation---obligation%1:04:00:: to assist other countries---country%1:14:00:: in their development---development%1:22:02:: ; but this obligation---obligation%1:04:00:: pertains only to countries---country%1:14:00:: which are honestly seeking to become responsible members---member%1:18:00:: of a stable and forward-moving world community---community%1:14:04:: .
When we look at countries---country%1:14:00:: like Iran---iran%1:15:00:: , Iraq---iraq%1:15:00:: , Pakistan---pakistan%1:15:00:: , and Burma---burma%1:15:00:: , where substantial progress---progress%1:04:01:: has been made in creating a minimum supply---supply%1:23:00:: of modern men---modern_man%1:05:00:: and of social overhead---overhead%1:21:00:: capital---capital%1:21:01:: , and where institutions---institution%1:14:00:: of centralized government---government%1:14:00:: exist , we find a second category---category%1:14:00:: of countries---country%1:14:00:: with a different set---set%1:14:00:: of problems---problem%1:26:00:: and hence different priorities---priority%1:26:00:: for policy---policy%1:09:00:: .
The men---man%1:18:00:: in power---power%1:26:00:: are committed in principle to modernization---modernization%1:04:00:: , but economic and social changes---change%1:04:00:: are proceeding only erratically .
Isolated enterprises---enterprise%1:14:00:: have been launched , but they are not yet related to each other in a meaningful pattern---pattern%1:09:02:: .
The society---society%1:14:00:: is likely to be characterized by having a fairly modernized urban sector---sector%1:14:00:: and a relatively untouched rural sector---sector%1:14:00:: , with very poor communications---communication%1:03:00:: between the two .
Progress---progress%1:04:01:: is impeded by psychological inhibitions---inhibition%1:04:00:: to effective action---action%1:04:02:: among those in power---power%1:26:00:: and by a failure---failure%1:04:00:: on their part---part%1:09:02:: to understand how local resources---resource%1:21:00:: , human and material , can be mobilized to achieve the national goals---goal%1:09:00:: of modernization---modernization%1:04:00:: already symbolically accepted .
Most countries---country%1:14:00:: in this second category---category%1:14:00:: share the difficulty---difficulty%1:09:02:: of having many of the structures---structure%1:09:00:: of a modern political and social system---social_system%1:14:00:: without the modern standards---standard%1:10:00:: of performance---performance%1:04:00:: required to make them effective .
In these rapidly changing societies---society%1:14:00:: there is also too little appreciation---appreciation%1:09:00:: of the need---need%1:26:00:: for effort---effort%1:04:00:: to achieve goals---goal%1:09:00:: .
The colonial period---period%1:28:00:: has generally left people---people%1:14:00:: believing that government---government%1:14:00:: can , if it wishes , provide all manner---manner%1:09:01:: of services---service%1:04:08:: for them - and that with independence---independence%1:26:00:: free men---freeman%1:18:00:: do not have to work to realize the benefits---benefit%1:07:00:: of modern life---life%1:26:01:: .
For example , in accordance---accordance%1:10:00:: with the fashion---fashion%1:04:00:: of the times---times%1:28:01:: , most transitional societies---society%1:14:00:: have announced economic development---development%1:04:01:: plans---plan%1:09:01:: of varying numbers---number%1:07:00:: of years---year%1:28:01:: ; such is the mystique---mystique%1:07:00:: of planning---planning%1:04:00:: that people---people%1:14:00:: expect that fulfillment---fulfillment%1:04:00:: of the plan---plan%1:09:01:: will follow automatically upon its announcement---announcement%1:10:01:: .
The civil services---civil_service%1:14:00:: in such societies---society%1:14:00:: are generally inadequate to deal competently with the problems---problem%1:26:00:: facing them ; and their members---member%1:18:00:: often equate a government---government%1:14:00:: career---career%1:04:00:: with security---security%1:26:00:: and status---status%1:26:00:: rather than with sacrifice---sacrifice%1:04:01:: , self-discipline---self-discipline%1:07:00:: , and competence---competence%1:07:00:: .
American policy---policy%1:09:00:: should press constantly the view---view%1:09:02:: that until these governments---government%1:14:00:: demand---demand%1:04:00:: efficiency---efficiency%1:09:00:: and effectiveness---effectiveness%1:07:00:: of their bureaucracies---bureaucracy%1:14:00:: there is not the slightest hope---hope%1:09:00:: that they will either modernize of democratize their societies---society%1:14:00:: .
We should spread the view---view%1:09:02:: that planning---planning%1:04:00:: and national development---development%1:22:02:: are serious matters---matter%1:09:00:: which call for effort---effort%1:04:00:: as well as enthusiasm---enthusiasm%1:07:00:: .
Above all , we should seek to encourage the leaders---leader%1:18:00:: of these societies---society%1:14:00:: to accept the unpleasant fact---fact%1:09:01:: that they are responsible for their fates---fate%1:11:00:: .
Only within the framework---framework%1:09:00:: of a mature relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: characterized by honest appraisals---appraisal%1:09:00:: of performance---performance%1:04:00:: can we provide telling assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: .
With respect to those countries---country%1:14:00:: whose leaders---leader%1:18:00:: prefer to live with their illusions---illusion%1:09:00:: , we can afford to wait , for in time their comparative lack---lack%1:26:00:: of progress---progress%1:04:01:: will become clear for all to see .
Our technical assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: to these countries---country%1:14:00:: should place special emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: on inducing the central governments---government%1:14:00:: to assume the role---role%1:04:00:: of advisor---advisor%1:18:00:: and guide which at an earlier stage---stage%1:28:00:: foreign experts---expert%1:18:00:: assumed in dealing with the central governments---government%1:14:00:: .
We should encourage the governments---government%1:14:00:: to develop their own technical assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: to communities---community%1:14:00:: , state---state%1:15:01:: and provincial governments---government%1:14:00:: , rural communities---community%1:14:00:: , and other smaller groups---group%1:03:00:: , making certain that no important segment---segment%1:06:00:: of the economy---economy%1:14:00:: is neglected .
Simultaneously we should be underlining the interrelationships---interrelationship%1:24:00:: of technical progress---progress%1:04:01:: in various fields---field%1:26:00:: , showing how agricultural training---training%1:04:00:: can be introduced into education---education%1:09:00:: , how health---health%1:26:00:: affects labor---labor%1:04:00:: productivity---productivity%1:07:00:: , how small business---business%1:14:00:: can benefit the rural farm community---community%1:14:00:: , and , above all , how progress---progress%1:04:01:: in each field---field%1:26:00:: relates to national progress---progress%1:04:01:: .
Efforts---effort%1:04:00:: such as the Community Development Program---group%1:03:00:: in the Philippines---location%1:03:00:: have demonstrated that transitional societies---society%1:14:00:: can work toward balanced national development---development%1:22:02:: .
To achieve this goal---goal%1:09:00:: of balanced development---development%1:22:02:: , communications---communication%1:03:00:: between the central government---government%1:14:00:: and the local communities---community%1:14:00:: must be such that the needs---need%1:03:00:: and aspirations---aspiration%1:07:00:: of the people---people%1:14:00:: themselves are effectively taken into account .
If modernization---modernization%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: are imposed from above , without the understanding---understanding%1:10:00:: and cooperation---cooperation%1:04:01:: of the people---people%1:14:00:: , they will encounter grave difficulties---difficulty%1:26:00:: .
Land reform---land_reform%1:04:00:: is likely to be a pressing issue---issue%1:09:01:: in many of these countries---country%1:14:00:: .
It should be American policy---policy%1:09:00:: not only to encourage effective land reform---land_reform%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: but also to underline the relation---relation%1:03:00:: of such reforms---reform%1:04:00:: to the economic growth---growth%1:22:01:: and modernization---modernization%1:04:00:: of the society---society%1:14:00:: .
As an isolated policy---policy%1:09:00:: , land reform---land_reform%1:04:00:: is likely to be politically disruptive ; as part---part%1:24:00:: of a larger development---development%1:04:01:: effort---effort%1:04:00:: , however , it may gain wide acceptance---acceptance%1:26:00:: .
It should also be recognized that the problem---problem%1:26:00:: of rural tenancy---tenancy%1:04:00:: cannot be solved by administrative decrees---decree%1:10:00:: alone .
Land reform---land_reform%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: need to be supplemented with programs---program%1:09:00:: for promoting rural credits---credit%1:10:00:: and technical assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: in agriculture---agriculture%1:04:01:: .
Lastly , governmental and private planners---planner%1:18:00:: will at this stage---stage%1:28:00:: begin to see large capital---capital%1:21:01:: requirements---requirement%1:17:00:: looming ahead .
By holding out prospects---prospect%1:26:00:: for external capital---capital%1:21:01:: assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: , the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: can provide strong incentives---incentive%1:16:00:: to prepare for the concerted economic drive---drive%1:04:04:: necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth---growth%1:22:01:: .
At a third stage---stage%1:26:00:: in the modernization---modernization%1:04:00:: process are such countries---country%1:14:00:: as India---india%1:15:00:: , Brazil---brazil%1:15:00:: , the Philippines---philippines%1:15:00:: , and Taiwan---taiwan%1:15:00:: , which are ready and committed to move into the stage---stage%1:26:00:: of self-sustaining growth---growth%1:22:01:: .
They must continue to satisfy basic capital---capital%1:21:01:: needs---need%1:03:00:: ; and there persists the dual problem---problem%1:26:00:: of maintaining operational unity---unity%1:26:00:: around a national program---program%1:09:00:: of modernization---modernization%1:04:00:: while simultaneously decentralizing participation---participation%1:04:00:: in the program---program%1:09:00:: to wider and wider groups---group%1:03:00:: .
But these countries---country%1:14:00:: have made big strides---stride%1:23:00:: toward developing the necessary human and social overhead---overhead%1:21:00:: capital---capital%1:21:01:: ; they have established reasonably stable and effective governmental institutions---institution%1:14:00:: at national and local levels---level%1:26:00:: ; and they have begun to develop a capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sectors---sector%1:14:00:: of their economies---economy%1:14:00:: .
On the economic front---front%1:15:00:: , the first priority---priority%1:26:00:: of these countries---country%1:14:00:: is to mobilize a vastly increased volume---volume%1:07:03:: of resources---resource%1:21:00:: .
Several related tasks---task%1:04:01:: must be carried out if self-sustaining growth---growth%1:22:01:: is to be achieved .
These countries---country%1:14:00:: must formulate a comprehensive , long-term program---program%1:09:00:: covering the objectives---objective%1:09:00:: of both the private and the public sectors---sector%1:14:00:: of the economy---economy%1:14:00:: .
They must in their planning---planning%1:04:00:: be able to count on at least tentative commitments---commitment%1:04:00:: of foreign capital---capital%1:21:01:: assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: over periods---period%1:28:00:: of several years---year%1:28:01:: .
Capital---capital%1:21:01:: imports---import%1:06:00:: drawn from a number---number%1:07:00:: of sources---source%1:15:00:: must be employed and combined skillfully enough to permit domestic investment---investment%1:21:00:: programming---programming%1:04:01:: to go forward .
Capital---capital%1:21:01:: flows---flow%1:04:00:: must be coordinated with national needs---need%1:17:00:: and planning---planning%1:04:00:: .
Finally , a balance---balance%1:26:00:: must be effected among project---project%1:09:00:: finance---finance%1:04:00:: , utilization---utilization%1:04:00:: of agricultural surpluses---surplus%1:07:00:: , and general balance of payments---balance_of_payments%1:21:00:: support---support%1:04:04:: .
Thus , although the agenda---agenda%1:09:00:: of external assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: in the economic sphere---sphere%1:15:00:: are cumulative , and many of the policies---policy%1:10:00:: suggested for nations---nation%1:14:00:: in the earlier stages---stage%1:26:00:: remain relevant , the basic purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of American economic policy---economic_policy%1:10:00:: during the later stages---stage%1:26:00:: of development---development%1:22:02:: should be to assure that movement---movement%1:04:00:: into a stage---stage%1:26:00:: of self-sustaining growth---growth%1:22:01:: is not prevented by lack---lack%1:26:00:: of foreign exchange---foreign_exchange%1:21:00:: .
There remain many political and administrative problems---problem%1:26:00:: to be solved .
For one thing , although considerable numbers---number%1:07:00:: of men---men%1:14:00:: have been trained , bureaucracies---bureaucracy%1:14:00:: are still deficient in many respects---respect%1:09:00:: ; even the famed Indian Civil Service---group%1:03:00:: is not fully adequate to the tremendous range---range%1:07:00:: of tasks---task%1:04:01:: it has undertaken .
Technical assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: in training middle - and upper-level management personnel---management_personnel%1:14:00:: is still needed in many cases---case%1:11:00:: .
There are also more basic problems---problem%1:26:00:: .
This is the stage---stage%1:26:00:: at which democratic developments---development%1:22:02:: must take place if the society---society%1:14:00:: is to become an open community---community%1:14:00:: of creative people---people%1:14:00:: .
Nevertheless , impulses---impulse%1:16:00:: still exist among the ruling elite---elite%1:14:00:: to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need---need%1:26:00:: for centralized and authoritarian practices---practice%1:04:00:: .
Another great danger---danger%1:04:00:: is that the emerging middle class---middle_class%1:14:00:: will feel itself increasingly alienated from the political leaders---political_leader%1:18:00:: who still justify their dominance---dominance%1:26:00:: by reference---reference%1:10:02:: to the struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: for independence---independence%1:26:00:: or the early phase---phase%1:28:00:: of nationalism---nationalism%1:07:00:: .
The capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: of intellectuals---intellectual%1:18:00:: and members---member%1:18:00:: of the new professional classes---class%1:14:01:: to contribute creatively to national development---development%1:22:02:: is likely to be destroyed by a constraining sense of inferiority---inferiority%1:26:00:: toward both their own political class---class%1:14:01:: and their colleagues---colleague%1:18:00:: and professional counterparts---counterpart%1:09:00:: in the West---west%1:15:00:: .
Particularly when based upon a single dominant party---party%1:14:01:: , governments---government%1:14:00:: may respond to such a situation---situation%1:26:00:: by claiming a monopoly---monopoly%1:26:02:: of understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: about the national interest---interest%1:07:01:: .
Convinced of the wisdom---wisdom%1:09:01:: of their own actions---action%1:04:02:: , and reassured by the promises---promise%1:09:00:: of their economic development---development%1:04:01:: programs---program%1:09:00:: , governments---government%1:14:00:: may fail to push outward to win more and more people---people%1:14:00:: to the national effort---effort%1:04:00:: , becoming instead rigid and inflexible in their policies---policy%1:09:00:: .
American policy---policy%1:09:00:: toward such societies---society%1:14:00:: should stress our sympathy---sympathy%1:24:00:: for the emerging social and professional classes---class%1:14:01:: .
It should attempt to communicate both an appreciation---appreciation%1:09:00:: of professional standards---standard%1:10:00:: and an understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of the tremendous powers---power%1:26:00:: and potentialities---potentiality%1:09:00:: of genuinely open and pluralistic societies---society%1:14:00:: .
We have every obligation---obligation%1:04:00:: to take seriously their claims---claim%1:10:00:: to being democratic and free countries---country%1:14:00:: ; we also have , in consequence---consequence%1:19:00:: , the duty---duty%1:04:00:: to appraise realistically and honestly their performance and to communicate our judgments---judgment%1:09:04:: to their leaders---leader%1:18:00:: in frank but friendly ways---way%1:07:01:: .
We have emphasized that the modernizing process in each society---society%1:14:00:: will take a considerable period of time---period_of_time%1:28:00:: .
With the exception---exception%1:09:00:: of treaty---treaty%1:10:00:: making , foreign relations---relation%1:03:00:: were historically concerned for the most part with conditions---condition%1:26:00:: of short or at least measurable duration---duration%1:28:00:: .
Foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: now takes on a different perspective---perspective%1:09:00:: and must become skilled not merely at response---response%1:10:02:: but also at projection---projection%1:09:01:: .
American and free-world---free_world%1:14:00:: policies---policy%1:09:00:: can marginally affect the pace---pace%1:28:00:: of transition---transition%1:11:00:: ; but basically that pace---pace%1:28:00:: depends on changes---change%1:11:00:: in the supply---supply%1:23:00:: of resources---resource%1:21:00:: and in the human attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: , political institutions---institution%1:14:00:: , and social structure---social_structure%1:14:00:: which each society---society%1:14:00:: must generate .
It follows that any effective policy---policy%1:09:00:: toward the underdeveloped countries---country%1:14:00:: must have a realistically long working horizon---horizon%1:07:00:: .
It must be marked by a patience---patience%1:07:00:: and persistence---persistence%1:07:02:: which have not always been its trademark---trademark%1:10:00:: .
This condition---condition%1:26:00:: affects not only the conception---conception%1:11:00:: but also the legislative and financial support---support%1:04:04:: of foreign policy---foreign_policy%1:10:00:: , especially in the context---context%1:26:00:: of economic aid---aid%1:04:00:: .
`` But tell me , doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , where do you plan to conduct the hatching---hatching%1:22:00:: '' ?
Alex---person%1:03:00:: asked .
`` That will have to be in the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: '' , the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: retorted , confirming Alex---person%1:03:00:: 's anticipations---anticipation%1:09:00:: .
`` What I want you to do is to go to the market---market%1:06:00:: with me early tomorrow morning---morning%1:28:00:: and help smuggle the hen---hen%1:05:01:: back into the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: '' .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: paid the bill---bill%1:10:01:: and they repaired to the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: , room---room%1:06:00:: number---number%1:23:00:: nine---nine%1:23:00:: , to initiate Alex---person%1:03:00:: further into these undertakings---undertaking%1:04:00:: .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: opened the smallest of his cases---case%1:06:00:: , an unimposing straw---straw%1:27:00:: bag---bag%1:06:01:: , and exposed the contents---content%1:14:00:: for Alex---person%1:03:00:: 's inspection---inspection%1:04:00:: .
Inside , carefully packed in straw---straw%1:27:00:: , were six eggs---egg%1:05:00:: , but the eye---eye%1:09:00:: of a poultry---poultry%1:05:00:: psychologist---psychologist%1:18:00:: was required to detect what scientifically valuable specimentalia lay inside ; to Alex---person%1:03:00:: they were merely six not unusual hens---hen%1:05:01:: ' eggs---egg%1:05:00:: .
There was little enough time---time%1:28:05:: to contemplate them , however ; in an instant---instant%1:28:01:: the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: was stalking across the room---room%1:06:00:: with an antique ledger---ledger%1:21:00:: in his hands---hand%1:08:00:: , thoroughly eared and big as a table top---tabletop%1:06:00:: .
He placed it on Alex---person%1:03:00:: 's lap---lap%1:08:00:: .
`` This is my hen---hen%1:05:01:: ledger---ledger%1:21:00:: '' , he informed him in an absorbed way---way%1:07:01:: .
`` It 's been going since 1908 when I was a junior---junior%1:18:01:: in college---college%1:14:00:: .
That first entry---entry%1:21:00:: there is the Vermont Flumenophobe , the earliest and one of the most successful of my eighty-three varieties---variety%1:14:00:: - great big scapulars---scapular%1:05:00:: and hardly any primaries---primary%1:05:00:: at all .
Could n't take them near a river---river%1:17:00:: , though , or they 'd squawk like a turkey cock---turkey_cock%1:05:00:: the day---day%1:28:00:: before Thanksgiving---thanksgiving%1:28:00:: '' .
The ledger---ledger%1:21:00:: was full of most precise information---information%1:09:00:: :
date---date%1:28:00:: of laying---laying%1:22:00:: , length---length%1:07:01:: of incubation period---incubation_period%1:28:00:: , number---number%1:23:00:: of chicks---chick%1:05:00:: reaching the first week---week%1:28:00:: , second week---week%1:28:00:: , fifth week---week%1:28:00:: , weight---weight%1:07:00:: of hen---hen%1:05:01:: , size---size%1:07:00:: of rooster---rooster%1:05:00:: 's wattles---wattle%1:06:00:: and so on , all scrawled out in a hand---hand%1:10:00:: that looked more Chinese---chinese%1:10:00:: than English---english%1:10:00:: , the most jagged and sprawling Alex---person%1:03:00:: had ever seen .
Below these particulars---particular%1:09:00:: was a series---series%1:14:00:: of alpha---alpha%1:10:00:: beta---beta%1:10:00:: gammas---gamma%1:10:00:: connected by arrows---arrow%1:10:00:: and crosses---cross%1:07:00:: which denoted the lineage---lineage%1:14:00:: of the breed .
Alex---person%1:03:00:: 's instruction---instruction%1:04:01:: was rapid , for the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: had to go off to the Rue Ecole de Medecine---group%1:03:00:: to hear more speeches---speech%1:10:01:: with only time---time%1:28:05:: for one sip---sip%1:04:01:: of wine---wine%1:13:00:: to sustain him through them all .
But after the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's return---return%1:04:01:: that night---night%1:28:00:: Alex---person%1:03:00:: could see , from the high window---window%1:06:00:: in his own room---room%1:06:00:: , the now familiar figure---figure%1:25:00:: crouched on a truly impressive heap---heap%1:14:00:: of towels---towel%1:06:00:: , apparently giving its egg---egg%1:05:00:: hatching---hatching%1:22:00:: powers---power%1:09:01:: one final chance---chance%1:26:00:: before it was replaced in its office---office%1:04:01:: by a sure-enough hen---hen%1:05:01:: .
A knocking---knocking%1:11:00:: at Alex---person%1:03:00:: 's door---door%1:06:00:: roused him at six o'clock the following morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
It was the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , dressed and ready for the expedition---expedition%1:04:00:: to the market---market%1:06:00:: , and Alex---person%1:03:00:: was obliged to prepare himself in haste .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: stood about , waiting for Alex---person%1:03:00:: to dress , with a show---show%1:10:03:: of impatience---impatience%1:26:00:: , and soon they were moving , as quietly as could be , through the still dark hallways---hallway%1:06:00:: , past the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: of the patronne---patronne%1:18:00:: , and so into the street---street%1:06:00:: .
The market---market%1:06:00:: was not far and , once there , the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's sense---sense%1:09:05:: of immediacy---immediacy%1:07:01:: left him and he fell into a state---state%1:03:00:: of harmony---harmony%1:07:01:: with the birds---bird%1:05:00:: around him .
He stroked the hens---hen%1:05:01:: and they responded with delighted clucks---cluck%1:11:00:: , he gobbled with the turkeys---turkey%1:05:00:: and they at once were all attention---attention%1:09:00:: , he quacked with the ducks---duck%1:05:00:: , and cackled with a pair---pair%1:23:00:: of exceedingly flattered geese---goose%1:05:00:: .
The dawn---dawn%1:28:00:: progressed and it seemed that the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: would never be done with his ministrations---ministration%1:04:00:: when quite abruptly something broke his revery---revery%1:09:00:: .
It was a fine broody hen---broody_hen%1:05:00:: , white , with a maternal eye---eye%1:09:01:: and a striking abundance---abundance%1:07:00:: of feathers---feather%1:05:00:: in the under region---region%1:15:00:: of the abdomen---abdomen%1:08:00:: .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , with the air---air%1:07:00:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: whose professional interests---interest%1:09:00:: have found scope---scope%1:07:00:: , drew Alex---person%1:03:00:: 's attention---attention%1:09:00:: to those excellences---excellence%1:07:00:: which might otherwise have escaped him : the fine color---color%1:07:00:: in comb---comb%1:05:01:: and wattles---wattle%1:08:00:: , the length---length%1:07:00:: and quality---quality%1:07:02:: of neck---neck%1:08:00:: and saddle hackles---saddle_hackle%1:05:00:: , the firm , wide spread---spread%1:07:02:: of the toes---toe%1:08:01:: , and a rare justness---justness%1:07:01:: in the formation---formation%1:06:00:: of the ear---ear%1:08:00:: lappets---lappet%1:08:00:: .
All search---search%1:04:00:: was ended ; he had found his fowl---fowl%1:05:00:: .
The purchase---purchase%1:04:00:: was effected and they made their way towards the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: again , the hen---hen%1:05:01:: , with whom some sort---sort%1:09:00:: of communication---communication%1:10:01:: had been set up , nestling in the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's arms---arm%1:08:00:: .
The clocks---clock%1:06:00:: struck seven-thirty as they approached the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: entrance---entrance%1:06:00:: ; and hopes---hope%1:12:01:: that the chambermaid---chambermaid%1:18:00:: and patronne---patronne%1:18:00:: would still be abed began to rise in Alex---person%1:03:00:: 's well exercised breast---breast%1:08:01:: .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: was wearing a long New England---new_england%1:15:00:: greatcoat---greatcoat%1:06:00:: , hardly necessary in the June---june%1:28:00:: weather---weather%1:19:00:: but a garment---garment%1:06:00:: which proved well adapted to the sequestration---sequestration%1:04:00:: of hens---hen%1:05:01:: .
Alex---person%1:03:00:: entered first and was followed by the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: who , for all his care---care%1:09:00:: , manifested a perceptible bulge---bulge%1:25:00:: on his left side---side%1:08:00:: where the hen---hen%1:05:01:: was cradled .
They advanced in a line---line%1:14:01:: across the entrance hall---entrance_hall%1:06:00:: to the stairway---stairway%1:06:00:: and up , with gingerly steps---step%1:04:00:: , towards the first landing---landing%1:06:01:: .
It was then that they heard the tread---tread%1:04:00:: of one descending and , in some perturbation---perturbation%1:26:00:: glancing up , saw the patronne---patronne%1:18:00:: coming towards them as they gained the landing---landing%1:06:01:: .
`` Bonjour , messieurs---monsieur%1:18:00:: , vous etes matinals '' , she greeted them pleasantly .
Alex---person%1:03:00:: explained that they had been out for a stroll---stroll%1:04:00:: before breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: while the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: edged around behind him , attempting to hide the protuberance---protuberance%1:25:00:: at his left side---side%1:08:00:: behind Alex---person%1:03:00:: 's arm---arm%1:08:00:: and back---back%1:08:00:: .
`` Vous voulez vos petits dejeuners tout de suite alors '' ? their hostess---hostess%1:18:00:: enquired .
Alex---person%1:03:00:: told her that there was no hurry---hurry%1:26:00:: for their breakfasts---breakfast%1:13:00:: , trying at the same time to effect a speedy separation---separation%1:04:00:: of the persons---person%1:03:00:: before and behind him .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , he noticed , was attempting a transverse movement---movement%1:04:04:: towards the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: , but before the movement---movement%1:04:04:: could be completed a distinct and audible cluck---cluck%1:11:00:: ruffled the air---air%1:15:00:: in the hollow---hollow%1:25:02:: of the stair-well---stairwell%1:06:00:: .
Eyes---eye%1:08:00:: swerved in the patronne---patronne%1:18:00:: 's head---head%1:08:00:: , Alex---person%1:03:00:: coughed loudly , and the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , with a sforzando---sforzando%1:10:01:: of chicken---chicken%1:05:01:: noises---noise%1:11:00:: floating behind him , took to the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: in long shanked leaps---leap%1:04:00:: .
`` Comment '' ? ejaculated the surprised woman---woman%1:18:00:: , looking at Alex---person%1:03:00:: for an explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: but he , parting from her without ceremony---ceremony%1:04:01:: , only offered a few words---words%1:10:03:: about the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's provincial American speech---speech%1:10:00:: and a state---state%1:03:00:: of nerves---nerves%1:26:00:: brought on by the demands---demand%1:09:00:: of his work---work%1:04:01:: .
With that he hurried up the stairs , followed by her suspicious gaze---gaze%1:04:00:: .
When Alex---person%1:03:00:: entered his room---room%1:06:00:: , the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: was already preparing a nest---nest%1:17:00:: in the straw---straw%1:27:00:: case---case%1:06:00:: , six eggs---egg%1:05:00:: ready for the hen---hen%1:05:01:: 's attentions---attention%1:04:01:: .
There was no reference---reference%1:10:02:: to the incident---incident%1:11:00:: on the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: , his powers---power%1:09:01:: being absorbed by this more immediate business---business%1:09:00:: .
The hen---hen%1:05:01:: appeared to have no doubts---doubt%1:09:00:: as to her duties---duty%1:04:00:: and was quick to settle down to the performance---performance%1:04:00:: of them .
One part---part%1:17:00:: of her audience---audience%1:14:00:: was totally engaged , the connoisseur---connoisseur%1:18:00:: witnessing a peculiarly fine performance---performance%1:10:00:: of some ancient classic---classic%1:06:00:: , the other part---part%1:17:00:: , the guest---guest%1:18:00:: of the connoisseur---connoisseur%1:18:00:: , attentive as one who must take an intelligent interest---interest%1:09:00:: in that which he does not fully understand .
The spectacle---spectacle%1:10:00:: progressed towards a denouement---denouement%1:11:00:: which was obviously still remote ; the audience---audience%1:14:00:: attended .
Time---time%1:28:05:: elapsed but the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: was obviously unconscious of its passage---passage%1:04:04:: until an unwelcome knock---knock%1:11:01:: on the door---door%1:06:00:: interrupted the processes of nature---nature%1:17:00:: .
Startled , he jumped up to pull---pull%1:04:00:: hen---hen%1:05:01:: and case---case%1:06:00:: out of view---view%1:15:00:: , and Alex---person%1:03:00:: went to the door---door%1:06:00:: .
He opened it a crack---crack%1:06:00:: and in doing so made as much shuffling---shuffling%1:04:01:: , coughing , and scraping---scraping%1:11:00:: noise---noise%1:09:00:: as possible in order to drown emanations---emanation%1:04:00:: from the hen---hen%1:05:01:: who had begun to protest .
It was Giselle---person%1:03:00:: , the fille de chambre---fille_de_chambre%1:18:00:: , come to clean the room---room%1:06:00:: , and while she stood before him with ears---ear%1:08:00:: pricked up and regard---regard%1:04:00:: all curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: , explaining her errand---errand%1:04:00:: , Alex---person%1:03:00:: could see from the corner---corner%1:25:00:: of his eye---eye%1:08:00:: the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: doing all he could to calm the displeased bird---bird%1:05:00:: .
Giselle---person%1:03:00:: was reluctant but Alex---person%1:03:00:: succeeded in persuading her to come back in five minutes---minute%1:28:00:: and the door---door%1:06:00:: was shut again .
`` Who was that , young feller '' ? the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: instantly asked .
`` That was the fille de chambre---fille_de_chambre%1:18:00:: , the one you thought could n't get the eggs---egg%1:05:00:: out .
Anyhow she 's coming back in five minutes---minute%1:28:00:: to do the room---room%1:06:00:: '' .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's mind---mind%1:09:00:: was working at a great speed---speed%1:07:00:: ; he rose to put his greatcoat---greatcoat%1:06:00:: on and addressed Alex---person%1:03:00:: in a muted voice---voice%1:10:00:: .
`` Have you got our keys---key%1:06:00:: handy '' ?
`` Right in my pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: '' .
The hall---hall%1:06:03:: was empty and Alex---person%1:03:00:: beckoned ; they climbed the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: which creaked , very loudly to their sensitive ears---ear%1:08:00:: , and reached the next floor---floor%1:06:01:: .
A guest---guest%1:18:00:: was locking his room---room%1:06:00:: ; they passed behind him and got to Alex---person%1:03:00:: 's room---room%1:06:00:: unnoticed .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: sat down rather wearily , caressing the hen---hen%1:05:01:: and remarking that the city---city%1:15:00:: was not the place---place%1:15:00:: for a poultry---poultry%1:05:00:: loving man---man%1:18:00:: , but no sooner was the remark---remark%1:10:00:: out than a knock---knock%1:11:01:: at this door---door%1:06:00:: obliged him to cover the hen---hen%1:05:01:: with his greatcoat---greatcoat%1:06:00:: once more .
At the door---door%1:06:00:: Alex---person%1:03:00:: managed to persuade the increasingly astonished fille de chambre---fille_de_chambre%1:18:00:: to return in ten minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
It was evident that a second transfer---transfer%1:04:00:: had to be effected , and that it had to take place between the time---time%1:11:00:: the fille---fille_de_chambre%1:18:00:: finished the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's room---room%1:06:00:: and the time---time%1:11:00:: she began Alex---person%1:03:00:: 's .
They waited three minutes---minute%1:28:00:: and then crept out on tip-toe ; the halls---hall%1:06:03:: were empty and they passed down the stairs to number---number%1:23:00:: nine---nine%1:23:00:: and listened at the door---door%1:06:00:: .
A bustle---bustle%1:04:00:: of sheets---sheet%1:06:00:: being smoothed and pillows---pillow%1:06:00:: being arranged indicated the fille de chambre---fille_de_chambre%1:18:00:: 's presence---presence%1:26:00:: inside ; they listened and suddenly a step---step%1:23:00:: towards the door---door%1:06:00:: announced another important fact---fact%1:09:01:: .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: shot down to the lavatory---lavatory%1:06:00:: and turned the doorknob---doorknob%1:06:00:: , but to no effect---effect%1:19:00:: : the lavatory---lavatory%1:06:00:: was occupied .
Although a look---look%1:07:01:: of alarm---alarm%1:12:00:: passed over his face---face%1:08:00:: , he did not arrest his movements---movement%1:04:00:: but disappeared into the shower room---shower_room%1:06:00:: just as the chambermaid---chambermaid%1:18:00:: emerged from number---number%1:23:00:: nine---nine%1:23:00:: .
Alex---person%1:03:00:: suppressed those expressions---expression%1:07:00:: of relief---relief%1:26:00:: which offered to prevail in his face---face%1:08:00:: and escape from his throat---throat%1:08:00:: ; unwarranted they were in any case for , as he stood facing the fille de chambre---fille_de_chambre%1:18:00:: , his ears---ear%1:08:00:: were assailed by new sounds---sound%1:07:00:: from the interior---interior%1:15:01:: of the shower room---shower_room%1:06:00:: .
The events---event%1:26:00:: of the last quarter---quarter%1:23:01:: of an hour---hour%1:28:00:: , mysterious to any bird---bird%1:05:00:: accustomed only to the predictable life---life%1:26:01:: of coop---coop%1:06:01:: and barnyard---barnyard%1:06:00:: , had overcome the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's hen---hen%1:05:01:: and she gave out a series---series%1:14:00:: of cackly wails---wail%1:10:00:: , perhaps mourning her nest---nest%1:17:00:: , but briefly enjoyed .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's wits---wit%1:09:00:: had not left him , however , for all his sixty-eight years---years%1:28:00:: , and the wails---wail%1:10:00:: were almost immediately lost in the sound---sound%1:07:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: rushing out from the showerhead---showerhead%1:06:00:: .
Alex---person%1:03:00:: nodded to the maid---maid%1:18:01:: as though nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: unusual were taking place and entered the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's room---room%1:06:00:: .
Shortly , the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: himself entered , his hair---hair%1:08:00:: somewhat wet from the shower---shower%1:04:00:: , but evidently satisfied with the outcome---outcome%1:11:00:: of their adventures---adventure%1:04:00:: .
Without comment---comment%1:10:00:: he opened the closet---closet%1:06:02:: and from its shelves---shelf%1:06:00:: constructed a highboard around the egg---egg%1:05:00:: case---case%1:06:00:: which he had placed on the floor---floor%1:06:00:: inside .
Next , the hen---hen%1:05:01:: was nested and all seemed well .
The two men---man%1:18:00:: sat for some time---time%1:28:00:: , savoring the pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: of escape---escape%1:04:00:: from peril---peril%1:26:00:: and the relief---relief%1:26:00:: such escape---escape%1:04:00:: brings , before they got up and left the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: , the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: to go to the conference house---conference_house%1:06:00:: and Alex---person%1:03:00:: to go to the main post office---post_office%1:14:01:: .
Alex---person%1:03:00:: returned to the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: , rather weary and with no new prospects---prospect%1:26:00:: of a role---role%1:04:00:: , in the late afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: , but found the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: in an ebullient mood---mood%1:12:00:: .
At the time---time%1:11:00:: Alex---person%1:03:00:: arrived he was engaged in some sort---sort%1:09:00:: of intimate communication---communication%1:10:01:: with the hen---hen%1:05:01:: , who had settled herself on the nest---nest%1:17:00:: most peacefully after the occurrences---occurrence%1:11:00:: of the morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
`` Chickens---chicken%1:05:01:: have short memories---memory%1:09:00:: '' , the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: remarked , `` that 's why they are better company---company%1:26:00:: than most people---people%1:14:00:: I know '' , and he went on to break some important news---news%1:10:00:: to Alex---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Well '' , he began , `` It seems like some people---people%1:14:00:: in Paris---paris%1:15:00:: want to hear more from me than those fellers over at the conference house---conference_house%1:06:00:: do .
They 've got a big vulture---vulture%1:05:00:: from Tanganika---location%1:03:00:: at the zoo---zoo%1:06:00:: here , with a wife---wife%1:18:00:: for him , too , very rare birds---bird%1:05:00:: , both of them , the only Vulturidae of their species---species%1:14:00:: outside Africa---africa%1:17:00:: .
Seems like she 's willing , but the male---male%1:05:00:: just flops around all day---day%1:28:02:: like the bashful boy---boy%1:18:00:: who took Jeannie May---person%1:03:00:: behind the barn---barn%1:06:00:: and then did n't know what to do , and the people---people%1:14:00:: at the zoo---zoo%1:06:00:: have n't got any vulture---vulture%1:05:00:: chicks---chick%1:05:00:: to show for their trouble---trouble%1:04:02:: .
There was one fact---fact%1:09:01:: which Rector---person%1:03:00:: could not overlook , one truth---truth%1:09:00:: which he could not deny .
As long as there were two human beings---human_being%1:05:00:: working together on the same project---project%1:04:00:: , there would be competition---competition%1:04:00:: and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave---grave%1:28:00:: .
No matter how devoted a man---man%1:18:00:: was , no matter how fully he gave his life---life%1:26:02:: to the Lord---lord%1:18:02:: , he could never extinguish that one spark---spark%1:11:01:: of pride---pride%1:12:00:: that gave him definition---definition%1:07:00:: as an individual---individual%1:03:00:: .
All of the jobs---job%1:04:01:: in the mission---mission%1:14:01:: might be equal in the eyes---eye%1:08:00:: of the Lord---lord%1:18:02:: , but they were certainly not equal in the eyes---eye%1:08:00:: of the Lord---lord%1:18:02:: 's servants---servant%1:18:00:: .
It was only natural that Fletcher---person%1:03:00:: would strive for a position---position%1:07:00:: in which he could make the decisions---decision%1:04:00:: .
Even Rector---person%1:03:00:: himself was prey---prey%1:05:00:: to this spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: of competition---competition%1:04:00:: and he knew it , not for a more exalted office---office%1:14:01:: in the hierarchy---hierarchy%1:14:00:: of the church---church%1:14:00:: - his ambitions---ambition%1:12:00:: for the bishopry---bishopry%1:04:00:: had died very early in his career---career%1:04:00:: - but for the one clear victory---victory%1:11:00:: he had talked about to the colonel---colonel%1:18:00:: .
He was not sure how much of this desire---desire%1:12:00:: was due to his devotion---devotion%1:12:00:: to the church---church%1:14:00:: and how much was his own ego---ego%1:12:01:: , demanding to be satisfied , for the two---two%1:23:00:: were intertwined and could not be separated .
He wanted desperately to see Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: defeated , the Communists---communist%1:18:01:: in the village---village%1:14:00:: rooted out , the mission---mission%1:14:01:: standing triumphant , for in the triumph---triumph%1:12:00:: of the Lord---lord%1:18:02:: he himself would be triumphant , too .
But perhaps this was a part---part%1:24:00:: of the eternal plan---plan%1:09:01:: , that man 's ambition---ambition%1:12:00:: when linked with God---god%1:18:00:: would be a driving---driving_force%1:04:00:: , indefatigable force---force%1:07:01:: for good---good%1:07:01:: in the world---world%1:17:01:: .
How foolish it was to try to fathom the truth---truth%1:09:00:: in an area---area%1:09:00:: where only faith---faith%1:09:00:: would suffice .
He would have to work without questioning the motives---motive%1:03:00:: which made him work and content himself with the thought---thought%1:09:01:: that the eventual victory---victory%1:11:00:: , however it was brought about , would be sweet indeed .
His first move---move%1:04:00:: was to send Hino---person%1:03:00:: to the village---village%1:14:00:: to spend a few days---day%1:28:00:: .
His arm---arm%1:08:00:: had been giving him some trouble---trouble%1:11:00:: and Rector---person%1:03:00:: was not enough of a medical expert---expert%1:18:00:: to determine whether it had healed improperly or whether Hino---person%1:03:00:: was simply rebelling against the tedious work---work%1:04:00:: in the print shop---print_shop%1:06:00:: , using the stiffness---stiffness%1:07:00:: in his arm---arm%1:08:00:: as an excuse---excuse%1:10:00:: .
In any event Rector---person%1:03:00:: sent him to the local hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: to have it checked , telling him to keep his ears open while he was in the village---village%1:14:00:: to see if he could find out what Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: was planning .
Hino---person%1:03:00:: was elated at the prospect---prospect%1:26:00:: .
He was allowed to spend his nights---night%1:28:00:: at an inn---inn%1:06:00:: near the hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: and he was given some extra money---money%1:21:00:: to go to the pachinko---pachinko%1:04:00:: parlor---parlor%1:06:00:: - an excellent place---place%1:15:00:: to make contact---contact%1:04:02:: with the enemy---enemy%1:18:00:: .
He left with all the joyous spirit---spirit%1:07:02:: of a child---child%1:18:00:: going on a holiday---holiday%1:28:00:: , nodding attentively as Rector---person%1:03:00:: gave him his final instructions---instruction%1:10:04:: .
He was to get involved in no arguments---argument%1:10:03:: ; he was to try to make no converts---convert%1:18:00:: ; he was simply to listen and report back what he heard .
It was a ridiculous situation---situation%1:26:00:: and Rector---person%1:03:00:: knew it , for Hino---person%1:03:00:: , frankly partisan , openly gregarious , would make a poor espionage agent---espionage_agent%1:18:00:: .
If he wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner---manner%1:07:02:: he would probably receive more truthful answers---answer%1:10:00:: than if he tried to get them by indirection---indirection%1:04:00:: .
If he wanted to know anything , he would end up asking about it point-blank , but in this guileless manner---manner%1:07:01:: he would probably receive more truthful answers than if he tried to get them by indirection .
In all of his experience---experience%1:09:00:: in the mission---mission%1:14:01:: field---field%1:15:01:: Rector---person%1:03:00:: had never seen a convert---convert%1:18:00:: quite like Hino---person%1:03:00:: .
From the moment---moment%1:28:00:: that Hino---person%1:03:00:: had first walked into the mission---mission%1:14:01:: to ask for a job---job%1:04:00:: , any job---job%1:04:00:: - his qualifications---qualification%1:07:00:: neatly written on a piece of paper---piece_of_paper%1:10:00:: in a precise hand---hand%1:10:00:: - he had been ready to become a Christian---christian%1:18:00:: .
He had already been studying the Bible---bible%1:10:00:: ; he knew the fundamentals---fundamentals%1:09:00:: , and after studying with Fletcher---person%1:03:00:: for a time---time%1:28:05:: he approached Rector---person%1:03:00:: , announced that he wanted to be baptized and that was that .
Rector---person%1:03:00:: had never been able to find out much---much%1:23:00:: about Hino---person%1:03:00:: 's past---past%1:28:01:: .
Hino---person%1:03:00:: talked very little about himself except for the infrequent times---time%1:11:00:: when he used a personal illustration---illustration%1:06:00:: in connection---connection%1:26:00:: with another subject---subject%1:10:00:: .
Putting the pieces---piece%1:06:00:: of this mosaic---mosaic%1:06:00:: together , Rector---person%1:03:00:: had the vague outlines---outline%1:09:00:: of a biography---biography%1:10:00:: .
Hino---person%1:03:00:: was the fourth son---son%1:18:00:: of an elderly farmer---farmer%1:18:00:: who lived on the coast---coast%1:17:00:: , in Chiba---location%1:03:00:: , and divided his life---life%1:28:00:: between the land---land%1:17:00:: and the sea---sea%1:17:00:: , supplementing the marginal livelihood---livelihood%1:21:00:: on his small rented farm---farm%1:06:00:: with seasonal employment---employment%1:04:00:: on a fishing boat---fishing_boat%1:06:00:: .
Without exception---exception%1:09:00:: Hino---person%1:03:00:: 's brothers---brother%1:18:00:: turned to either one or both of their father---father%1:18:00:: 's occupations---occupation%1:04:00:: , but Hino---person%1:03:00:: showed a talent---talent%1:09:00:: for neither and instead spent most of his time---time%1:28:05:: on the beach---beach%1:17:00:: where he repaired nets---net%1:06:02:: and proved immensely popular as a storyteller---storyteller%1:18:00:: .
He had gone into the Japanese navy---navy%1:14:00:: , had been trained as an officer---officer%1:18:03:: , had participated in one or two battles---battle%1:04:00:: - he never went into detail---detail%1:10:00:: regarding his military experience---experience%1:09:00:: - and at the age---age%1:07:00:: of twenty-five , quite as a bolt---bolt%1:04:01:: out of the blue , he had walked into the mission---mission%1:14:01:: as if he belonged here and had become a Christian---christian%1:18:00:: .
Rector---person%1:03:00:: was often curious ; often tempted to ask questions---question%1:10:00:: but he never did .
If and when Hino---person%1:03:00:: decided to tell him about his experiences---experience%1:09:00:: , he would do so unasked .
Rector---person%1:03:00:: had no doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: that Hino---person%1:03:00:: would come back from the village---village%1:14:00:: bursting with information---information%1:10:00:: , ready to impart it with his customary gusto---gusto%1:12:00:: , liberally embellished with his active imagnation---imagination%1:09:01:: .
When the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: rang on the day---day%1:28:01:: after Hino---person%1:03:00:: went down to the village---village%1:14:00:: , Rector---person%1:03:00:: had a hunch---hunch%1:09:00:: it would be Hino---person%1:03:00:: with some morsel---morsel%1:23:00:: of information---information%1:10:00:: too important to wait until his return---return%1:04:01:: , for there were few telephones---telephone%1:06:00:: in the village---village%1:14:00:: and the phone---phone%1:06:00:: in Rector---person%1:03:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: rarely rang unless it was important .
He was surprised to find Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: 's secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: on the other end---end%1:15:03:: of the line---line%1:06:07:: .
He was even more startled when he heard what Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: wanted .
The oyabun---oyabun%1:18:00:: was entertaining a group---group%1:03:00:: of dignitaries---dignitary%1:18:00:: , the secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: said , businessmen---businessman%1:18:00:: from Tokyo---location%1:03:00:: for the most part , and Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: wished to show them the mission---mission%1:14:01:: .
They had never seen one before and had expressed a curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: about it .
Rector---person%1:03:00:: said .
When would the oyabun---oyabun%1:18:00:: like to bring his guests---guest%1:18:00:: up here '' ?
`` This afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: '' , the secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: said .
`` At three---three%1:23:00:: o'clock if it will be of convenience---convenience%1:07:00:: to you at that time---time%1:28:06:: '' .
`` All right '' , Rector---person%1:03:00:: said .
He was about to hang up the phone---phone%1:06:00:: , but a note---note%1:10:05:: of hesitancy---hesitancy%1:12:00:: in the secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: 's voice---voice%1:10:00:: left the conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: open .
`` I beg to inquire if the back is now safe for travelers---traveler%1:18:00:: '' , he said .
Rector---person%1:03:00:: laughed despite himself .
`` Unless the oyabun---oyabun%1:18:00:: has been working on it '' , he said , then checked himself and added : `` You can tell Kayabashi-san---person%1:03:00:: that the back road---road%1:06:00:: is in very good condition and will be quite safe for his party---party%1:14:02:: to use '' .
The secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: sighed with relief---relief%1:12:00:: and then the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: clicked in Rector---person%1:03:00:: 's hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
Rector---person%1:03:00:: had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: why Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: wanted to visit the mission---mission%1:14:01:: .
For the oyabun---oyabun%1:18:00:: to make such a trip---trip%1:04:00:: was either a sign---sign%1:10:05:: of great weakness---weakness%1:07:01:: or an indication---indication%1:10:00:: of equally great confidence---confidence%1:26:02:: , and from all the available information---information%1:09:00:: it was probably the latter .
Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: must feel fairly certain of his victory---victory%1:11:00:: in order to make a visit---visit%1:04:01:: like this , a trip---trip%1:04:00:: which could be so easily misinterpreted by the people---people%1:14:00:: in the village---village%1:14:00:: .
At the same time , it was unlikely that any businessmen---businessman%1:18:00:: would spend a day---day%1:28:00:: in a Christian mission---mission%1:14:01:: out of mere curiosity---curiosity%1:09:00:: .
No , Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: was bringing his associates---associate%1:18:00:: here for a specific purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: and Rector---person%1:03:00:: would not be able to fathom it until they arrived .
When he had given the call---call%1:10:01:: a few moments---moment%1:28:01:: thought---thought%1:09:00:: , he went into the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: to ask Mrs. Yamata---person%1:03:00:: to prepare tea---tea%1:13:00:: and sushi---sushi%1:13:00:: for the visitors---visitor%1:18:00:: , using the formal English china---china%1:06:00:: and the silver---silver%1:21:00:: tea service---tea_service%1:06:00:: which had been donated to the mission---mission%1:14:01:: , then he went outside to inspect the grounds---grounds%1:06:00:: .
Fujimoto---person%1:03:00:: had a pile---pile%1:21:00:: of cuttings---cutting%1:20:00:: near one side---side%1:15:02:: of the lawn---lawn%1:15:00:: .
Rector---person%1:03:00:: asked him to move it for the time being ; he wanted the mission---mission%1:14:01:: compound---compound%1:06:00:: to be effortlessly spotless .
A good initial impression---impression%1:07:00:: would be important now .
He went into the print shop---print_shop%1:06:00:: , where Fletcher---person%1:03:00:: had just finished cleaning the press---press%1:06:01:: .
`` How many pamphlets---pamphlet%1:10:01:: do we have in stock '' ?
Rector---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` I should say about a hundred thousand '' , Fletcher---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` I would like to enact a little tableau---tableau%1:14:00:: this afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: '' , Rector---person%1:03:00:: said , He explained about the visit---visit%1:04:01:: and the effect---effect%1:09:00:: he wished to create , the picture---picture%1:10:02:: of a very busy mission---mission%1:14:01:: .
He did not wish to deceive Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: exactly , just to display the mission---mission%1:14:01:: activities---activity%1:04:00:: in a graphic and impressive manner---manner%1:07:02:: .
Fletcher---person%1:03:00:: nodded as he listened to the instructions---instruction%1:10:04:: and said he would arrange the things---thing%1:26:00:: Rector---person%1:03:00:: requested .
Rector---person%1:03:00:: 's next stop---stop%1:15:00:: was at the schoolroom---schoolroom%1:06:00:: , where Mavis---person%1:03:00:: was monitoring a test---test%1:10:00:: .
He beckoned to her from the door---door%1:06:01:: and she slipped quietly outside .
He told her of the visitors---visitor%1:18:00:: and then of his plans---plan%1:09:00:: .
`` How many children---child%1:18:00:: do you have present today '' ? he said .
She looked back toward the schoolroom---schoolroom%1:06:00:: .
`` Fifteen---fifteen%1:23:00:: '' , she said .
`` No---no%1:10:00:: , only fourteen .
The little Ito---person%1:03:00:: girl---girl%1:18:02:: had to go home .
She has a pretty bad cold---cold%1:26:00:: '' .
`` I would like them to appear very busy today---today%1:28:00:: , not busy exactly , but joyous , exuberant , full of life .
I want to create the impression---impression%1:07:00:: of a compound---compound%1:09:00:: full of children---child%1:18:00:: .
Mavis---person%1:03:00:: smiled .
As Rector---person%1:03:00:: was walking back toward the residential hall---hall%1:06:04:: , Johnson---person%1:03:00:: came out of the basement---basement%1:06:00:: and bounded up to him .
The altercation---altercation%1:10:00:: in the coffee house---coffeehouse%1:06:00:: had done little to dampen his spirits---spirit%1:26:01:: , but he was still a little wary around Rector---person%1:03:00:: for they had not yet discussed the incident---incident%1:11:00:: .
`` I think I 've fixed the pump---pump%1:06:00:: so we won't have to worry about it for a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: '' , he said .
`` I 've adjusted the gauge---gauge%1:06:00:: so that the pump---pump%1:06:00:: cuts out before the water---water%1:27:00:: gets too low '' .
`` Fine '' , Rector---person%1:03:00:: said .
He looked out over the expanse---expanse%1:07:00:: of the compound---compound%1:09:00:: .
It was going to take a lot of activity---activity%1:04:00:: to fill it .
`` Have you ever operated a transit---transit%1:06:00:: '' ? he said .
`` No , sir '' , Johnson---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` You are about to become a first-class surveyor---surveyor%1:18:00:: '' , Rector---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` When Konishi---person%1:03:00:: gets back with the jeep---jeep%1:06:00:: , I want you to round up two or three Japanese boys---boy%1:18:00:: .
Konishi---person%1:03:00:: can help you .
You 'll find an old transit---transit%1:06:00:: in the basement---basement%1:06:00:: .
The glass---glass%1:27:00:: is out of it , but that won't matter .
It looks pretty efficient and that 's the important thing---thing%1:09:02:: '' .
Johnson---person%1:03:00:: nodded .
Rector---person%1:03:00:: was warming to his over-all strategy---strategy%1:09:00:: by the time---time%1:11:00:: he got back to the residential hall---hall%1:06:04:: .
It was rather a childish game---game%1:04:01:: , all in all , but everybody seemed to be getting into the spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: of the thing---thing%1:26:00:: and he could not remember when he had enjoyed planning anything quite so much .
He was not sure what effect---effect%1:19:00:: it would have , but that was really beside the point---point%1:10:01:: when you got right down to it .
He was not going to lose the mission---mission%1:14:01:: by default---default%1:04:00:: , and whatever reason---reason%1:16:00:: Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: had for bringing his little sight-seeing---sightseeing%1:04:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: to the mission---mission%1:14:01:: , he was going to be in for a surprise---surprise%1:11:00:: .
He found Elizabeth---person%1:03:00:: in the parlor---parlor%1:06:00:: and asked her to make sure everything was in order in the residential hall---hall%1:06:04:: , and then to take charge of the office---office%1:14:01:: while the party---party%1:14:01:: was here .
When everything had been done , Rector---person%1:03:00:: went back to his desk---desk%1:06:00:: to occupy himself with his monthly report---report%1:10:03:: until three---three%1:23:00:: o'clock .
At two thirty he sent Fujimoto---person%1:03:00:: to the top---top%1:15:00:: of the wall---wall%1:06:00:: at the northeast corner---corner%1:15:02:: of the mission---mission%1:14:01:: to keep an eye on the ridge---ridge%1:17:00:: road---road%1:06:00:: and give a signal---signal%1:10:00:: when he first glimpsed the approach---approach%1:04:00:: of Kayabashi---person%1:03:00:: 's party---party%1:14:01:: .
Then Rector---person%1:03:00:: , attired in his best blue serge---serge%1:06:00:: suit---suit%1:06:00:: , sat in a chair---chair%1:06:00:: out on the lawn---lawn%1:15:00:: , in the shade---shade%1:26:00:: of a tree---tree%1:20:00:: , smoking a cigarette---cigarette%1:06:00:: and waiting .
The air---air%1:27:00:: was cooler here , and the lacy pattern---pattern%1:06:00:: of the trees---tree%1:20:00:: threw a dappled shadow---shadow%1:15:00:: on the grass---grass%1:20:00:: , an effect---effect%1:07:00:: which he found pleasant .
The Fulton County Grand Jury---group%1:03:00:: said Friday---friday%1:28:00:: an investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: of Atlanta---atlanta%1:15:00:: 's recent primary election---primary_election%1:04:00:: produced `` no evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: '' that any irregularities---irregularity%1:04:00:: took place .
The jury---jury%1:14:00:: further said in term---term%1:28:00:: end---end%1:28:00:: presentments---presentment%1:04:00:: that the City Executive Committee---group%1:03:00:: , which had over-all charge---charge%1:04:03:: of the election---election%1:04:01:: , `` deserves the praise---praise%1:10:00:: and thanks---thanks%1:10:00:: of the City of Atlanta---location%1:03:00:: '' for the manner---manner%1:07:02:: in which the election---election%1:04:01:: was conducted .
The September---september%1:28:00:: October---october%1:28:00:: term---term%1:28:00:: jury---jury%1:14:00:: had been charged by Fulton---location%1:03:00:: Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye---person%1:03:00:: to investigate reports---report%1:10:00:: of possible `` irregularities---irregularity%1:04:00:: '' in the hard-fought primary---primary%1:04:00:: which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr.---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Only a relative handful---handful%1:23:01:: of such reports---report%1:10:00:: was received '' , the jury---jury%1:14:00:: said , `` considering the widespread interest---interest%1:09:00:: in the election---election%1:04:01:: , the number---number%1:23:00:: of voters---voter%1:18:00:: and the size---size%1:07:00:: of this city---city%1:15:00:: '' .
The jury---jury%1:14:00:: said it did find that many of Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: 's registration---registration%1:04:00:: and election---election%1:04:01:: laws---law%1:10:00:: `` are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous '' .
It recommended that Fulton---location%1:03:00:: legislators---legislator%1:18:00:: act `` to have these laws---law%1:10:00:: studied and revised to the end---end%1:09:02:: of modernizing and improving them '' .
The grand jury---grand_jury%1:14:00:: commented on a number---number%1:07:00:: of other topics---topic%1:09:00:: , among them the Atlanta---atlanta%1:15:00:: and Fulton County---location%1:03:00:: purchasing departments---purchasing_department%1:14:00:: which it said `` are well operated and follow generally accepted practices---practice%1:04:00:: which inure to the best interest---interest%1:07:01:: of both governments---government%1:14:00:: '' .
However , the jury---jury%1:14:00:: said it believes `` these two offices---office%1:14:01:: should be combined to achieve greater efficiency---efficiency%1:09:00:: and reduce the cost---cost%1:21:00:: of administration---administration%1:04:00:: '' .
The City Purchasing Department---group%1:03:00:: , the jury---jury%1:14:00:: said , `` is lacking in experienced clerical personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: as a result---result%1:19:00:: of city---city%1:15:01:: personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: policies---policy%1:09:00:: '' .
It urged that the city---city%1:15:01:: `` take steps---step%1:04:02:: to remedy '' this problem---problem%1:10:00:: .
Implementation---implementation%1:04:01:: of Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: 's automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: title---title%1:10:04:: law---law%1:10:00:: was also recommended by the outgoing jury---jury%1:14:00:: .
It urged that the next Legislature---legislature%1:14:00:: `` provide enabling funds---fund%1:21:00:: and re-set the effective date---date%1:28:00:: so that an orderly implementation---implementation%1:04:01:: of the law---law%1:10:00:: may be effected '' .
The grand jury---grand_jury%1:14:00:: took a swipe at the State Welfare Department---group%1:03:00:: 's handling---handling%1:04:00:: of federal funds---fund%1:21:00:: granted for child welfare services---child_welfare_service%1:14:00:: in foster homes---foster_home%1:14:00:: .
`` This is one of the major items---item%1:09:00:: in the Fulton County---location%1:03:00:: general assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: '' , the jury---jury%1:14:00:: said , but the State Welfare Department---group%1:03:00:: `` has seen fit to distribute these funds---fund%1:21:00:: through the welfare---welfare%1:04:00:: departments---department%1:14:00:: of all the counties---county%1:15:00:: in the state---state%1:15:01:: with the exception---exception%1:09:00:: of Fulton County---location%1:03:00:: , which receives none of this money---money%1:21:00:: .
The jurors---juror%1:18:00:: said they realize `` a proportionate distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: of these funds---fund%1:21:00:: might disable this program---program%1:09:00:: in our less populous counties---county%1:15:00:: '' .
Nevertheless , `` we feel that in the future Fulton County---location%1:03:00:: should receive some portion---portion%1:04:00:: of these available funds---fund%1:21:00:: '' , the jurors---juror%1:18:00:: said .
`` Failure---failure%1:04:00:: to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden---burden%1:09:01:: '' on Fulton---location%1:03:00:: taxpayers---taxpayer%1:18:00:: .
The jury---jury%1:14:00:: also commented on the Fulton---location%1:03:00:: ordinary---ordinary%1:26:00:: 's court---court%1:14:00:: which has been under fire for its practices---practice%1:04:00:: in the appointment---appointment%1:04:00:: of appraisers---appraiser%1:18:01:: , guardians---guardian%1:18:00:: and administrators---administrator%1:18:00:: and the awarding---awarding%1:04:00:: of fees---fee%1:21:00:: and compensation---compensation%1:21:00:: .
The jury---jury%1:14:00:: said it found the court---court%1:14:00:: `` has incorporated into its operating procedures---operating_procedure%1:04:00:: the recommendations---recommendation%1:10:00:: '' of two previous grand juries---grand_jury%1:14:00:: , the Atlanta Bar Association---group%1:03:00:: and an interim citizens committee---citizens_committee%1:14:00:: .
`` These actions---action%1:04:02:: should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court---court%1:14:00:: 's wards---ward%1:18:00:: from undue costs---cost%1:21:00:: and its appointed and elected servants---servant%1:18:00:: from unmeritorious criticisms---criticism%1:10:00:: '' , the jury---jury%1:14:00:: said .
Regarding Atlanta---atlanta%1:15:00:: 's new million dollar---dollar%1:23:00:: airport---airport%1:06:00:: , the jury---jury%1:14:00:: recommended `` that when the new management---management%1:14:00:: takes charge Jan.---jan%1:28:00:: 1 the airport---airport%1:06:00:: be operated in a manner---manner%1:07:02:: that will eliminate political influences---influence%1:07:00:: '' .
The jury---jury%1:14:00:: did not elaborate , but it added that `` there should be periodic surveillance---surveillance%1:04:01:: of the pricing---pricing%1:09:00:: practices---practice%1:04:00:: of the concessionaires---concessionaire%1:18:00:: for the purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of keeping the prices---price%1:21:00:: reasonable '' .
On other matters---matter%1:09:00:: , the jury---jury%1:14:00:: recommended that :
Four additional deputies---deputy%1:18:00:: be employed at the Fulton County Jail---group%1:03:00:: and `` a doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , medical intern---medical_intern%1:18:00:: or extern---extern%1:18:00:: be employed for night---night%1:28:00:: and weekend---weekend%1:28:00:: duty---duty%1:04:02:: at the jail---jail%1:06:00:: '' .
Fulton---location%1:03:00:: legislators---legislator%1:18:00:: `` work with city---city%1:15:01:: officials---official%1:18:01:: to pass enabling legislation---enabling_legislation%1:10:00:: that will permit the establishment---establishment%1:04:00:: of a fair and equitable '' pension---pension%1:21:00:: plan---plan%1:09:00:: for city---city%1:15:01:: employes---employee%1:18:00:: .

Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: Republicans---republican%1:18:01:: are getting strong encouragement---encouragement%1:04:00:: to enter a candidate---candidate%1:18:01:: in the 1962 governor 's race---governor's_race%1:11:00:: , a top official---official%1:18:01:: said Wednesday---wednesday%1:28:00:: .
Robert Snodgrass---person%1:03:00:: , state---state%1:14:01:: GOP---gop%1:14:00:: chairman---chairman%1:18:01:: , said a meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: held Tuesday---tuesday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: in Blue Ridge---location%1:03:00:: brought enthusiastic responses---response%1:10:02:: from the audience---audience%1:14:00:: .
State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey---person%1:03:00:: added that enthusiasm---enthusiasm%1:09:00:: was picking up for a state---state%1:15:01:: rally---rally%1:14:00:: to be held Sept.---sept%1:28:00:: 8 in Savannah---savannah%1:15:00:: at which newly elected Texas---texas%1:15:00:: Sen. John Tower---person%1:03:00:: will be the featured speaker---speaker%1:18:00:: .
In the Blue Ridge---location%1:03:00:: meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: , the audience---audience%1:14:00:: was warned that entering a candidate---candidate%1:18:01:: for governor---governor%1:18:00:: would force it to take petitions---petition%1:10:00:: out into voting precincts---voting_precinct%1:15:00:: to obtain the signatures---signature%1:10:00:: of registered voters---voter%1:18:00:: .
Despite the warning---warning%1:10:01:: , there was a unanimous vote---vote%1:04:00:: to enter a candidate---candidate%1:18:01:: , according to Republicans---republican%1:18:01:: who attended .
When the crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term---term%1:28:00:: to make the race---race%1:11:01:: , it voted no - and there were no dissents---dissent%1:10:03:: .
The largest hurdle---hurdle%1:06:00:: the Republicans---republican%1:18:01:: would have to face is a state---state%1:14:00:: law---law%1:10:00:: which says that before making a first race---race%1:11:01:: , one of two alternative courses---course%1:15:00:: must be taken :
Five per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of the voters---voter%1:18:00:: in each county---county%1:15:00:: must sign petitions---petition%1:10:00:: requesting that the Republicans---republican%1:18:01:: be allowed to place names---name%1:10:00:: of candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: on the general election---general_election%1:04:00:: ballot---ballot%1:04:00:: , or The Republicans---republican%1:18:01:: must hold a primary---primary%1:04:00:: under the county---county%1:15:00:: unit---unit%1:14:00:: system---system%1:09:00:: - a system---system%1:09:00:: which the party---party%1:14:01:: opposes in its platform---platform%1:10:00:: .
Sam Caldwell---person%1:03:00:: , State Highway Department---group%1:03:00:: public relations---public_relations%1:10:00:: director---director%1:18:00:: , resigned Tuesday---tuesday%1:28:00:: to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd---person%1:03:00:: 's campaign---campaign%1:11:00:: .
Caldwell---person%1:03:00:: 's resignation---resignation%1:10:01:: had been expected for some time---time%1:28:00:: .
He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford---person%1:03:00:: of Gainesville---location%1:03:00:: , who has been an assistant---assistant%1:18:00:: more than three years---year%1:28:01:: .
When the gubernatorial campaign---campaign%1:11:00:: starts , Caldwell---person%1:03:00:: is expected to become a campaign---campaign%1:11:00:: coordinator---coordinator%1:18:00:: for Byrd---person%1:03:00:: .
The Georgia Legislature---group%1:03:00:: will wind up its 1961 session---session%1:28:00:: Monday---monday%1:28:00:: and head for home - where some of the highway---highway%1:06:00:: bond---bond%1:21:02:: money---money%1:21:00:: it approved will follow shortly .
Before adjournment---adjournment%1:04:00:: Monday---monday%1:28:00:: afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: , the Senate---senate%1:14:00:: is expected to approve a study---study%1:04:00:: of the number---number%1:23:00:: of legislators---legislator%1:18:00:: allotted to rural---rural_area%1:15:00:: and urban areas---urban_area%1:15:00:: to determine what adjustments---adjustment%1:11:00:: should be made .
Gov. Vandiver---person%1:03:00:: is expected to make the traditional visit---visit%1:04:02:: to both chambers---chamber%1:06:02:: as they work toward adjournment---adjournment%1:04:00:: .
Vandiver---person%1:03:00:: likely will mention the $ 100 million---million%1:23:00:: highway---highway%1:06:00:: bond---bond%1:21:02:: issue---issue%1:09:01:: approved earlier in the session---session%1:28:00:: as his first priority---priority%1:26:00:: item---item%1:09:00:: .
Meanwhile , it was learned the State Highway Department---group%1:03:00:: is very near being ready to issue the first $ 30 million worth---worth%1:23:00:: of highway---highway%1:06:00:: reconstruction---reconstruction%1:04:00:: bonds---bond%1:21:02:: .
The bond---bond%1:21:02:: issue---issue%1:09:01:: will go to the state---state%1:14:00:: courts---court%1:14:00:: for a friendly test suit---test_suit%1:04:00:: to test the validity---validity%1:07:00:: of the act---act%1:10:01:: , and then the sales---sale%1:04:00:: will begin and contracts---contract%1:10:01:: let for repair---repair%1:04:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: on some of Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: 's most heavily traveled highways---highway%1:06:00:: .
A Highway Department---group%1:03:00:: source---source%1:18:01:: said there also is a plan---plan%1:09:00:: there to issue some $ 3 million---million%1:23:00:: to $ 4 million---million%1:23:00:: worth---worth%1:07:00:: of Rural Roads Authority---group%1:03:00:: bonds---bond%1:21:02:: for rural road---road%1:06:00:: construction---construction%1:04:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: .
The department---department%1:14:00:: apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority---group%1:03:00:: a revolving fund---revolving_fund%1:21:00:: under which new bonds---bond%1:21:02:: would be issued every time---time%1:11:00:: a portion---portion%1:04:00:: of the old ones are paid off by tax---tax%1:21:00:: authorities---authorities%1:14:00:: .
Vandiver---person%1:03:00:: opened his race---race%1:11:01:: for governor---governor%1:18:00:: in 1958 with a battle---battle%1:04:01:: in the Legislature---legislature%1:14:00:: against the issuance---issuance%1:04:00:: of $ 50 million---million%1:23:00:: worth---worth%1:23:00:: of additional rural roads---road%1:06:00:: bonds---bond%1:21:02:: proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin---person%1:03:00:: .
The Highway Department---group%1:03:00:: source---source%1:18:01:: told The Constitution , however , that Vandiver---person%1:03:00:: has not been consulted yet about the plans---plan%1:09:00:: to issue the new rural roads---road%1:06:00:: bonds---bond%1:21:02:: .
Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham---person%1:03:00:: will offer a resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: Monday---monday%1:28:00:: in the House---group%1:03:00:: to rescind the body---body%1:14:00:: 's action---action%1:04:02:: of Friday---friday%1:28:00:: in voting---voting%1:04:00:: itself a $ 10 per day---day%1:28:00:: increase---increase%1:11:00:: in expense---expense%1:21:00:: allowances---allowance%1:21:02:: .
Pelham---person%1:03:00:: said Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: there was research---research%1:04:00:: being done on whether the `` quickie---quickie%1:04:00:: '' vote---vote%1:04:00:: on the increase---increase%1:11:00:: can be repealed outright or whether notice---notice%1:10:02:: would have to first be given that reconsideration---reconsideration%1:10:00:: of the action---action%1:04:02:: would be sought .
While emphasizing that technical details---detail%1:09:00:: were not fully worked out , Pelham---person%1:03:00:: said his resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: would seek to set aside the privilege---privilege%1:07:00:: resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: which the House---group%1:03:00:: voted through 87 - 31 .
A similar resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: passed in the Senate---senate%1:14:00:: by a vote---vote%1:04:00:: of 29---29%1:23:00:: - 5---5%1:23:00:: .
As of Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: , there was no word---word%1:10:03:: of a resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: being offered there to rescind the action---action%1:04:02:: .
Pelham---person%1:03:00:: pointed out that Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: voters---voter%1:18:00:: last November---november%1:28:00:: rejected a constitutional amendment---amendment%1:04:00:: to allow legislators---legislator%1:18:00:: to vote---vote%1:04:00:: on pay---pay%1:21:01:: raises---raise%1:07:00:: for future Legislature---legislature%1:14:00:: sessions---session%1:28:00:: .
A veteran Jackson County---location%1:03:00:: legislator---legislator%1:18:00:: will ask the Georgia House---group%1:03:00:: Monday---monday%1:28:00:: to back federal aid---aid%1:21:00:: to education---education%1:04:01:: , something it has consistently opposed in the past---past%1:28:00:: .
Rep. Mac Barber---person%1:03:00:: of Commerce---group%1:03:00:: is asking the House---group%1:03:00:: in a privilege---privilege%1:07:02:: resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: to `` endorse increased federal support---support%1:04:04:: for public education---education%1:04:01:: , provided that such funds---fund%1:21:00:: be received and expended '' as state---state%1:14:00:: funds---funds%1:21:00:: .
Barber---person%1:03:00:: , who is in his 13th year---year%1:28:01:: as a legislator---legislator%1:18:00:: , said there `` are some members---member%1:18:00:: of our congressional delegation---delegation%1:14:00:: in Washington---washington%1:14:00:: who would like to see it ( the resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: ) passed '' .
But he added that none of Georgia---georgia%1:15:00:: 's congressmen---congressman%1:18:00:: specifically asked him to offer the resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: .
The resolution---resolution%1:10:01:: , which Barber---person%1:03:00:: tossed into the House---group%1:03:00:: hopper---hopper%1:06:00:: Friday---friday%1:28:00:: , will be formally read Monday---monday%1:28:00:: .
It says that `` in the event---event%1:26:00:: Congress---group%1:03:00:: does provide this increase---increase%1:11:00:: in federal funds---fund%1:21:00:: '' , the State Board of Education---group%1:03:00:: should be directed to `` give priority---priority%1:26:00:: '' to teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: pay---pay%1:21:01:: raises---raise%1:07:00:: .
After a long , hot controversy---controversy%1:10:00:: , Miller County---location%1:03:00:: has a new school superintendent---school_superintendent%1:18:00:: , elected , as a policeman---policeman%1:18:00:: put it , in the `` coolest election---election%1:04:01:: I ever saw in this county---county%1:15:00:: '' .
The new school superintendent---school_superintendent%1:18:00:: is Harry Davis---person%1:03:00:: , a veteran agriculture---agriculture%1:04:01:: teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: , who defeated Felix Bush---person%1:03:00:: , a school principal---school_principal%1:18:00:: and chairman---chairman%1:18:01:: of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee---group%1:03:00:: .
Davis---person%1:03:00:: received 1119 votes---vote%1:04:01:: in Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: 's election---election%1:04:01:: , and Bush---person%1:03:00:: got 402 .
Ordinary---ordinary%1:18:01:: Carey Williams---person%1:03:00:: , armed with a pistol---pistol%1:06:00:: , stood by at the polls---polls%1:15:00:: to insure order---order%1:26:00:: .
`` This was the coolest , calmest election---election%1:04:01:: I ever saw '' , Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Being at the polls---polls%1:15:00:: was just like being at church---church%1:04:00:: .
I did n't smell a drop---drop%1:23:00:: of liquor---liquor%1:13:00:: , and we did n't have a bit of trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: '' .
The campaign---campaign%1:11:00:: leading to the election---election%1:04:01:: was not so quiet , however .
It was marked by controversy---controversy%1:10:00:: , anonymous midnight---midnight%1:28:00:: phone calls---phone_call%1:10:00:: and veiled threats---threat%1:10:01:: of violence---violence%1:04:01:: .
The former county---county%1:15:00:: school superintendent---school_superintendent%1:18:00:: , George P. Callan---person%1:03:00:: , shot himself to death---death%1:26:00:: March---march%1:28:00:: 18 , four days---day%1:28:00:: after he resigned his post---post%1:04:00:: in a dispute---dispute%1:10:00:: with the county---county%1:15:00:: school board---school_board%1:14:00:: .
During the election---election%1:04:01:: campaign---campaign%1:11:00:: , both candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: , Davis---person%1:03:00:: and Bush---person%1:03:00:: , reportedly received anonymous telephone calls---telephone_call%1:10:00:: .
Ordinary---ordinary%1:18:01:: Williams---person%1:03:00:: said he , too , was subjected to anonymous calls---call%1:10:01:: soon after he scheduled the election---election%1:04:01:: .
Many local citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: feared that there would be irregularities---irregularity%1:04:00:: at the polls---polls%1:15:00:: , and Williams---person%1:03:00:: got himself a permit---permit%1:10:02:: to carry a gun---gun%1:06:00:: and promised an orderly election---election%1:04:01:: .
Sheriff Felix Tabb---person%1:03:00:: said the ordinary---ordinary%1:18:01:: apparently made good his promise---promise%1:10:00:: .
`` Everything went real smooth '' , the sheriff---sheriff%1:18:00:: said .
`` There was n't a bit of trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: '' .
The injured German veteran---veteran%1:18:01:: was a former miner---miner%1:18:00:: , twenty-four years---year%1:28:01:: old , who had been wounded by shrapnel---shrapnel%1:06:00:: in the back---back%1:06:00:: of the head---head%1:08:00:: .
This resulted in damage---damage%1:11:00:: to the occipital lobe---occipital_lobe%1:08:00:: and very probably to the left side---side%1:15:02:: of the cerebellum---cerebellum%1:08:00:: also .
In any event , the extraordinary result---result%1:19:00:: of this injury---injury%1:26:00:: was that he became `` psychically blind '' , while at the same time , apparently , the sense of touch---sense_of_touch%1:09:00:: remained essentially intact .
Psychical blindness---blindness%1:26:00:: is a condition---condition%1:26:00:: in which there is a total absence---absence%1:26:00:: of visual memory-images---memory_image%1:09:00:: , a condition---condition%1:26:00:: in which , for example , one is unable to remember something just seen or to conjure up a memory-picture---memory_picture%1:09:00:: of the visible appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: of a well-known friend---friend%1:18:00:: in his absence---absence%1:04:00:: .
This circumstance---circumstance%1:09:00:: in the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's case---case%1:09:00:: plus the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that his tactual capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: remained basically in sound working order---order%1:26:02:: constitutes its exceptional value---value%1:07:00:: for the problem---problem%1:10:00:: at hand since the evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: presented by the authors---author%1:18:00:: is overwhelming that , when the patient---patient%1:18:00:: closed his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , he had absolutely no spatial ( that is , third-dimensional ) awareness---awareness%1:09:01:: whatsoever .
The necessary inference---inference%1:09:00:: , as the authors---author%1:18:00:: themselves interpret it , would seem to be this : `` ( 1 ) Spatial qualities---quality%1:07:00:: are not among those grasped by the sense of touch---sense_of_touch%1:09:00:: , as such .
We do not arrive at spatial images---image%1:09:00:: by means---means%1:04:00:: of the sense of touch---sense_of_touch%1:09:00:: by itself .
( 2 ) Spatiality---spatiality%1:07:00:: becomes part---part%1:24:00:: of the tactual sensation---tactual_sensation%1:09:00:: only by way---way%1:04:01:: of visual representations---representation%1:09:00:: ; that is , there is , in the true sense---sense%1:10:00:: , only a visual space---visual_space%1:09:00:: '' .
The underlying assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: , of course , is that only sight---sight%1:09:00:: and touch---touch%1:09:01:: enable us , in any precise and fully dependable way---way%1:07:01:: , to locate objects---object%1:03:00:: in space---space%1:03:00:: beyond us , the other senses---sense%1:09:02:: being decidedly inferior , if not totally inadequate , in this regard---regard%1:09:00:: .
This is an assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: with which few would be disposed to quarrel .
Therefore , if the sense of touch---sense_of_touch%1:09:00:: is functioning normally and there is a complete absence---absence%1:26:00:: of spatial awareness---awareness%1:09:01:: in a psychically blind person---person%1:03:00:: when the eyes---eye%1:08:00:: are closed and an object---object%1:03:00:: is handled , the conclusion---conclusion%1:09:01:: seems unavoidable that touch---touch%1:09:01:: by itself cannot focus and take possession---possession%1:04:00:: of the third-dimensionality---third-dimensionality%1:07:00:: of things---thing%1:06:00:: and that actual sight---sight%1:09:00:: or visual representations---representation%1:09:00:: are necessary .
The force---force%1:07:00:: of the authors---author%1:18:00:: ' analysis---analysis%1:09:00:: ( if indeed it has any force---force%1:07:00:: ) can be felt by the reader---reader%1:18:00:: , I believe , only after three questions---question%1:10:00:: have been successfully answered .
( 1 ) What allows us to think that the patient---patient%1:18:00:: had no third-dimensional representations---representation%1:09:00:: when his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: were closed ?
( 2 ) What evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: is there that he was psychically blind ?
( 3 ) How can we be sure that his sense of touch---sense_of_touch%1:09:00:: was not profoundly disturbed by his head---head%1:08:00:: injury---injury%1:26:00:: ?
We shall consider these in the inverse order---order%1:14:00:: of their presentation---presentation%1:04:01:: .
Obviously , a satisfactory answer---answer%1:10:02:: to the third question---question%1:10:00:: is imperative , if the argument---argument%1:10:03:: is to get under way at all , for if there is any possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: of doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: whether the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's tactual sensitivity---sensitivity%1:09:00:: had been impaired by the occipital lesion---lesion%1:26:01:: , any findings---finding%1:04:00:: whatsoever in regard to the first question---question%1:10:00:: become completely ambiguous and fail altogether , of course , as evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: to establish the desired conclusion---conclusion%1:10:01:: .
The answer---answer%1:10:02:: the authors---author%1:18:00:: give to it , therefore , is of supreme importance---importance%1:07:00:: .
It is as follows : `` The usual sensitivity---sensitivity%1:09:00:: tests---test%1:09:02:: showed that the specific qualities---quality%1:07:00:: of skin-perceptiveness---skin_perceptiveness%1:09:00:: ( pressure---pressure%1:09:00:: , pain---pain%1:09:00:: , temperature---temperature%1:09:00:: ) , as well as the kinesthetic sensations---sensation%1:09:00:: ( muscular feelings---feeling%1:09:01:: , feelings---feeling%1:09:01:: in the tendons---tendon%1:08:00:: and joints---joint%1:08:00:: ) , were , as such , essentially intact , although they seemed , in comparison with normal reactions---reaction%1:04:00:: , to be somewhat diminished over the entire body---body%1:08:00:: .
The supposed tactual sense---sense%1:09:02:: of spatial location---location%1:04:01:: and orientation---orientation%1:04:00:: in the patient---patient%1:18:00:: and his ability---ability%1:07:00:: to specify the location---location%1:03:00:: of a member---member%1:08:00:: , as well as the direction---direction%1:24:00:: and scope---scope%1:07:00:: of a movement---movement%1:11:00:: , passively executed ( with one of his members---member%1:08:00:: ) , proved to have been , on the contrary , very considerably affected '' .
The authors---author%1:18:00:: insist , however , that these abnormalities---abnormality%1:26:00:: in the sense of touch---sense_of_touch%1:09:00:: were due absolutely to no organic disorders---disorder%1:26:03:: in that sense---sense%1:09:02:: faculty---faculty%1:09:00:: but rather to the injuries---injury%1:26:00:: which the patient---patient%1:18:00:: had sustained to the sense---sense%1:09:02:: of sight---sight%1:09:00:: .
First of all , what is their evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that the tactual apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: was fundamentally undamaged ?
( 1 ) When an object---object%1:03:00:: was placed in the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's hand---hand%1:08:00:: , he had no difficulty---difficulty%1:26:00:: determining whether it was warm or cold , sharp or blunt , rough or smooth , flexible , soft , or hard ; and he could tell , simply by the feel---feel%1:07:00:: of it , whether it was made of wood---wood%1:27:00:: , iron---iron%1:27:00:: , cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: , rubber---rubber%1:27:00:: , and so on .
And he could recognize , by touch---touch%1:11:00:: alone , articles---article%1:03:00:: which he had handled immediately before , even though they were altogether unfamiliar to him and could not be identified by him ; that is , he was unaware what kind---kind%1:09:00:: of objects---object%1:03:00:: they were or what their use---use%1:07:00:: was .
( 2 ) The patient---patient%1:18:00:: attained an astonishing efficiency---efficiency%1:09:00:: in a new trade---trade%1:04:00:: .
Because of his brain---brain%1:08:00:: injury---injury%1:26:00:: and the extreme damage---damage%1:11:00:: suffered to his sight---sight%1:09:00:: , the patient---patient%1:18:00:: had to train himself for a new line of work---line_of_work%1:04:00:: , that of a portfolio---portfolio%1:06:00:: maker---maker%1:18:00:: , an occupation---occupation%1:04:00:: requiring a great deal---great_deal%1:23:00:: of precision---precision%1:07:00:: in the making of measurements and a fairly well developed sense---sense%1:09:02:: of form---form%1:03:00:: and contour---contour%1:10:00:: .
It seems clear , when one takes into consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: the exceedingly defective eyesight---eyesight%1:09:00:: of the patient---patient%1:18:00:: ( we shall describe it in detail in connection with our second question---question%1:10:00:: , the one concerning the psychical blindness---blindness%1:26:00:: of the patient---patient%1:18:00:: ) , that he had to rely on his sense of touch---sense_of_touch%1:09:00:: much more than the usual portfolio---portfolio%1:06:00:: maker---maker%1:18:00:: and that consequently that faculty---faculty%1:09:00:: was most probably more sensitive to shape---shape%1:07:00:: and size---size%1:07:00:: than that of a person---person%1:03:00:: with normal vision---vision%1:09:01:: .
And so the authors---author%1:18:00:: conclude : `` The conduct---conduct%1:07:00:: of the patient---patient%1:18:00:: in his every-day life---life%1:26:01:: and in his work---work%1:04:01:: , even more than the foregoing facts---fact%1:10:01:: [ mentioned above under 1 ] , leave positively no room---room%1:26:00:: for doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: that the sense of touch---sense_of_touch%1:09:00:: , in the ordinary sense---sense%1:10:00:: of the word---word%1:10:00:: , was unaffected ; or , to put the same thing---thing%1:09:00:: in physiological terms---term%1:10:00:: , that the performance---performance%1:04:00:: capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: of the tactual apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: , from the periphery---periphery%1:25:00:: up to the tactual centers---center%1:08:00:: in the brain---brain%1:08:00:: , - that is , from one end---end%1:15:02:: to the other - was unimpaired '' .
If the argument---argument%1:10:02:: is accepted as essentially sound up to this point---point%1:09:01:: , it remains for us to consider whether the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's difficulties---difficulty%1:26:00:: in orienting himself spatially and in locating objects---object%1:03:00:: in space---space%1:03:00:: with the sense of touch---sense_of_touch%1:09:00:: can be explained by his defective visual condition---condition%1:26:00:: .
But before we can do this , we must first find answers---answer%1:10:02:: to our original questions---question%1:10:00:: 1 and 2 ; then we shall perhaps be in a position---position%1:09:00:: to provide something like a complete answer---answer%1:10:02:: to the question---question%1:10:00:: at hand .
In what ways---way%1:07:01:: , then , did the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's psychical blindness---blindness%1:26:00:: manifest itself ?
He could not see objects---object%1:03:00:: as unified , self-contained , and organized figures---figure%1:25:00:: , as a person---person%1:03:00:: does with normal vision---vision%1:09:01:: .
The meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: of this , as we shall see , is that he had no fund---fund%1:21:01:: of visual memory-images---memory_image%1:09:00:: of objects---object%1:03:00:: as objects---object%1:03:00:: ; and , therefore , he could not recognize even long-familiar things---thing%1:06:00:: upon seeing them again .
Instead , he constantly became lost in parts---part%1:17:00:: and components---component%1:24:00:: of them , confused some of their details---detail%1:09:00:: with those of neighboring objects---object%1:03:00:: , and so on , unless he allowed time---time%1:28:05:: to `` trace '' the object---object%1:03:00:: in question through minute movements---movement%1:11:00:: of the head---head%1:08:00:: and hands---hand%1:08:00:: and in this way---way%1:07:01:: to discover its contours---contour%1:10:00:: .
According to his own testimony---testimony%1:10:01:: , he never actually saw things---thing%1:06:00:: as shaped but only as generally amorphous `` blots---blot%1:07:00:: '' of color---color%1:07:00:: of a more or less indefinite size---size%1:07:00:: ; at their edges---edge%1:06:00:: they slipped pretty much out of focus altogether .
But by the tracing---tracing%1:04:00:: procedure---procedure%1:04:02:: , he could , in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner---manner%1:07:02:: , find the unseen form---form%1:07:01:: ; could piece , as it were , the jumbled mass---mass%1:14:02:: together into an organized whole and then recognize it as a man---man%1:18:00:: or a triangle---triangle%1:25:00:: or whatever it turned out to be .
If , however , the figure---figure%1:25:00:: to be discerned were complicated , composed of several interlocking subfigures---subfigure%1:25:00:: , and so on , even the tracing---tracing%1:04:00:: process---process%1:04:00:: failed him , and he could not focus even relatively simple shapes---shape%1:07:00:: among its parts---part%1:17:00:: .
This meant , concretely , that the patient---patient%1:18:00:: could not read at all without making writing---writing%1:04:01:: like movements---movement%1:11:00:: of the head---head%1:08:00:: or body---body%1:08:01:: , became easily confused by `` hasher marks---hash_mark%1:10:00:: '' inserted between hand-written words---word%1:10:00:: and thus confused the mark---mark%1:10:03:: for one of the letters---letter%1:10:01:: , and could recognize a simple straight line---straight_line%1:25:00:: or a curved one only by tracing it .
The patient---patient%1:18:00:: himself denied that he had any visual imagery---imagery%1:09:00:: at all ; and there was ample evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: of the following sort---sort%1:09:00:: to corroborate him .
After a conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: with another man---man%1:18:00:: , he was able to recount practically everything that had been said but could not describe at all what the other man---man%1:18:00:: looked like .
Nor could he call up memory-pictures---memory_picture%1:09:00:: of close friends---friend%1:18:00:: or relatives---relative%1:18:00:: .
In short , both his own declarations---declaration%1:10:00:: and his figural blindness---figural_blindness%1:26:00:: , when he looked at objects---object%1:03:00:: , seem to present undeniable evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: that he had simply no visual memory---memory%1:09:00:: at all .
He was oblivious of the form---form%1:07:01:: of the object---object%1:03:00:: actually being viewed , precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape---shape%1:07:00:: , already learned and held in visual memory---memory%1:09:00:: , as persons---person%1:03:00:: of normal vision---vision%1:09:01:: do .
He could not recognize it ; he was absolutely unfamiliar with it because he had no visual memory---memory%1:09:00:: at all .
Therefore , his only recourse---recourse%1:04:00:: was to learn the shape---shape%1:07:00:: all over again for each new visual experience---experience%1:09:01:: of the same individual object---object%1:03:00:: or type---type%1:09:00:: of object---object%1:03:00:: ; and this he could do only by going over its mass---mass%1:07:01:: with the tracing---tracing%1:04:00:: procedure---procedure%1:04:02:: .
Then he might finally recognize it , apparently by combining the visual blot---blot%1:07:00:: , actually being seen , with tactual feelings---feeling%1:09:01:: in the head or body---body%1:08:01:: accompanying the tracing---tracing%1:04:00:: movements---movement%1:11:00:: .
This would mean , it can readily be seen , that , again , for each new visual experience---experience%1:09:01:: the tracing---tracing%1:04:00:: motions---motion%1:10:00:: would have to be repeated because of the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of visual imagery---imagery%1:09:00:: .
As one would surmise , the procedure---procedure%1:04:02:: , however , could be repeated with the same object---object%1:03:00:: or with the same type---type%1:09:00:: of object---object%1:03:00:: often enough , so that the corresponding visual blots---blot%1:07:00:: and the merest beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: of the tracing---tracing%1:04:00:: movement---movement%1:11:00:: would provide clues---clue%1:10:00:: as to the actual shape---shape%1:07:00:: , which the patient---patient%1:18:00:: then immediately could determine by a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of inference---inference%1:09:00:: .
Men---man%1:18:00:: , trees---tree%1:20:00:: , automobiles---automobile%1:06:00:: , houses---house%1:06:00:: , and so on - objects---object%1:03:00:: continually confronted in everyday life---life%1:26:01:: - had each its characteristic blot---blot%1:07:00:: appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: and became easily recognizable , at the very beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: of tracing---tracing%1:04:00:: , by an inference---inference%1:09:00:: as to what each was .
Dice---dice%1:06:00:: , for example , he inferred from black dots---dot%1:25:00:: on a white surface---surface%1:06:00:: .
He evidently could not actually see the corners---corner%1:15:01:: of these objects---object%1:03:00:: , but their size---size%1:07:00:: and the dots---dot%1:25:00:: gave them away .
And the authors---author%1:18:00:: give numerous instances---instance%1:09:00:: of calculated guessing---guessing%1:09:00:: on the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's part---part%1:09:02:: to show how large a role---role%1:04:00:: it played in his process---process%1:04:00:: of readapting himself and how proficient he became at it .
Often he seems even to have been able to guess correctly , without the tracing---tracing%1:04:00:: motions---motion%1:10:00:: , solely on the basis---basis%1:09:00:: of qualitative differences---difference%1:07:00:: among the blot---blot%1:07:00:: like things---thing%1:06:00:: which appeared in his visual experience---experience%1:09:01:: .
Perhaps the very important question---question%1:10:00:: - What is , then , exactly the role---role%1:07:00:: of kinesthetic sensations---sensation%1:09:00:: in the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's ability---ability%1:07:00:: to recognize forms---form%1:03:00:: and shapes---shape%1:07:00:: by means---means%1:04:00:: of the tracing---tracing%1:04:00:: movements---movement%1:11:00:: when he is actually looking at things---thing%1:06:00:: ?
- has now been raised in the reader---reader%1:18:00:: 's mind---mind%1:09:00:: and in the following form---form%1:09:00:: .
If the patient---patient%1:18:00:: can perceive figure---figure%1:25:00:: kinesthetically when he cannot perceive it visually , then , it would seem , the sense of touch---sense_of_touch%1:09:00:: has immediate contact---contact%1:26:00:: with the spatial aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of things---thing%1:06:00:: in independence of visual representations---representation%1:09:00:: , at least in regard to two dimensions---dimension%1:07:00:: , and , as we shall see , even this much spatial awareness---awareness%1:09:00:: on the part of unaided touch---touch%1:09:01:: is denied by the authors---author%1:18:00:: .
How , then , do the kinesthetic sensations---sensation%1:09:00:: function in all this ?
The authors---author%1:18:00:: set about answering this fundamental question---question%1:10:00:: through a detailed investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: of the patient---patient%1:18:00:: 's ability---ability%1:07:00:: , tactually , ( 1 ) to perceive figure---figure%1:25:00:: and ( 2 ) to locate objects---object%1:03:00:: in space---space%1:03:00:: , with his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: closed ( or turned away from the object---object%1:03:00:: concerned ) .
Quite naturally , they make the investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: , first , by prohibiting the patient---patient%1:18:00:: from making any movements---movement%1:11:00:: at all and then , later , by repeating it and allowing the patient---patient%1:18:00:: to move in any way---way%1:07:01:: he wanted to .
When the patient---patient%1:18:00:: was not allowed to move his body---body%1:08:00:: in any way---way%1:07:01:: at all , the following striking results---result%1:19:00:: occurred .
During the Dorr---person%1:03:00:: trial the Democratic press condemned the proceedings---proceeding%1:04:00:: and heralded Dorr---person%1:03:00:: as a martyr---martyr%1:18:00:: to the principles---principle%1:09:01:: of the Declaration of Independence---declaration_of_independence%1:10:00:: .
During the Brown---person%1:03:00:: trial , however , the state---state%1:15:01:: 's most powerful Democratic newspaper---newspaper%1:14:00:: , the Providence Daily Post---group%1:03:00:: , stated that Brown---person%1:03:00:: was a murderer---murderer%1:18:00:: , a man---man%1:18:00:: of blood---blood%1:07:00:: , and that he and his associates---associate%1:18:00:: , with the assistance---assistance%1:04:00:: of Republicans---republican%1:18:01:: and Abolitionists---abolitionist%1:18:00:: , had plotted not only the liberation---liberation%1:04:02:: of the slaves---slave%1:18:00:: but also the overthrow---overthrow%1:04:01:: of state---state_government%1:14:00:: and federal governments---federal_government%1:14:00:: .
The Providence Daily Journal---group%1:03:00:: answered the Daily Post---group%1:03:00:: by stating that the raid---raid%1:04:00:: of John Brown---person%1:03:00:: was characteristic of Democratic acts---act%1:03:00:: of violence---violence%1:04:01:: and that `` He was acting in direct opposition---opposition%1:24:02:: to the Republican Party---republican_party%1:14:00:: , who proclaim as one of their cardinal principles---principle%1:09:01:: that they do not interfere with slavery---slavery%1:26:00:: in the states---state%1:15:01:: '' .
The two major newspapers---newspaper%1:14:00:: in Providence---providence%1:15:00:: continued , throughout the crisis---crisis%1:26:00:: , to accuse each other of misrepresenting the facts---fact%1:10:01:: and attempting to falsify history---history%1:10:00:: .
While the Daily Post---group%1:03:00:: continued to accuse Republicans---republican%1:18:01:: and the Daily Journal---group%1:03:00:: continued to accuse Democrats---democrat%1:18:01:: , the Woonsocket Patriot---group%1:03:00:: complained that the Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: authorities---authority%1:18:01:: showed indecent and cowardly haste---haste%1:07:00:: to condemn Brown---person%1:03:00:: and his men---men%1:14:00:: .
Editor Foss---person%1:03:00:: stated , `` Of their guilt---guilt%1:26:00:: there can be no doubt but they are entitled to sufficient time---time%1:28:05:: to prepare for trial , and a fair trial '' .
The Providence Daily Post---group%1:03:00:: thought that there were probably good reasons---reason%1:16:00:: for the haste---haste%1:07:00:: in which the trial was being conducted and that the only thing---thing%1:26:00:: gained by a delay---delay%1:28:00:: would be calmer feelings---feeling%1:26:00:: .
The Providence Daily Journal---group%1:03:00:: stated that although the guilt---guilt%1:26:00:: of Brown---person%1:03:00:: was evident , the South---south%1:15:00:: must guarantee him a fair trial to preserve domestic peace---peace%1:26:00:: .
On October---october%1:28:00:: 31 , 1859 , John Brown---person%1:03:00:: was found guilty of treason---treason%1:04:00:: against the state---state%1:15:01:: of Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: , inciting slave---slave%1:18:00:: rebellion---rebellion%1:04:00:: , and murder---murder%1:04:00:: .
For these crimes---crime%1:04:00:: he was sentenced to be hanged in public on Friday---friday%1:28:00:: , December---december%1:28:00:: 2 , 1859 .
Upon receiving the news---news%1:10:01:: , Northern writers---writer%1:18:00:: , editors---editor%1:18:00:: , and clergymen---clergyman%1:18:00:: heaped accusations---accusation%1:10:00:: of murder---murder%1:04:00:: on the Southern states---state%1:15:01:: , particularly Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: .
Although Rhode Islanders---rhode_islander%1:18:00:: were preparing for the state---state%1:15:01:: elections---election%1:04:01:: , they watched John Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's trial with extreme interest---interest%1:09:00:: .
On Wednesday---wednesday%1:28:00:: morning---morning%1:28:00:: , November 2---november_2%1:28:00:: , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal---group%1:03:00:: stated that although Brown---person%1:03:00:: justly deserved the extreme penalty---penalty%1:04:00:: , no man---man%1:18:00:: , however criminal , ought to suffer the penalty---penalty%1:04:00:: without a fairer trial .
The editor---editor%1:18:00:: 's main criticism---criticism%1:10:00:: of the trial was the haste---haste%1:07:00:: with which it was conducted .
The readers---reader%1:18:02:: of the Providence Daily Post---group%1:03:00:: , however , learned that it was generally conceded that `` Old Brown---person%1:03:00:: '' had a fair trial .
Concerning the sentence---sentence%1:04:00:: the editor---editor%1:18:00:: asked , `` What else can Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: do than to hang the men---man%1:18:00:: who have defied her laws---law%1:10:00:: , organized treason---treason%1:04:00:: , and butchered her citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: '' .
In the eastern section---section%1:15:01:: of the state---state%1:15:01:: the newspapers---newspaper%1:14:00:: ' reaction---reaction%1:09:00:: to Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's trial and sentence---sentence%1:04:00:: were basically identical .
J. Wheaton Smith---person%1:03:00:: , editor---editor%1:18:00:: of the Warren Telegraph---group%1:03:00:: stated that `` the ends---end%1:09:02:: of justice---justice%1:07:00:: must be satisfied , a solitary example---example%1:10:00:: must be set , in order that all those misnamed philantropists---philanthropist%1:18:00:: [ sic ] , who , actuated by a blind zeal---zeal%1:12:02:: , dare to instigate riot---riot%1:04:00:: , treason---treason%1:04:00:: , and murder---murder%1:04:00:: , may heed it and shape their future course---course%1:14:00:: accordingly '' .
The editor---editor%1:18:00:: of the Newport Advertiser---group%1:03:00:: could discover no evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: of extenuating circumstances---circumstance%1:09:00:: in the Brown---person%1:03:00:: trial which would warrant making an exception---exception%1:09:00:: to the infliction---infliction%1:04:00:: of capital punishment---capital_punishment%1:04:00:: .
In direct contrast---direct_contrast%1:24:00:: to the other Rhode Island---rhode_island%1:15:00:: editors---editor%1:18:00:: , Samuel S. Foss---person%1:03:00:: of the Woonsocket Patriot---group%1:03:00:: outwardly condemned the trial as being completely unfair .
Concerning the sentence---sentence%1:04:00:: , Foss---person%1:03:00:: wrote , `` If it be possible that mercy---mercy%1:04:00:: shall override vengeance---vengeance%1:04:00:: and that John Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's sentence---sentence%1:04:00:: shall be commuted to imprisonment---imprisonment%1:04:01:: , it would be well - well for the country---country%1:14:00:: and for Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: '' .
Despite the excitement---excitement%1:04:02:: being caused by the trial and sentence---sentence%1:04:00:: of John Brown---person%1:03:00:: , Rhode Islanders---rhode_islander%1:18:00:: turned their attention---attention%1:09:00:: to the state---state%1:15:01:: elections---election%1:04:01:: .
The state---state%1:15:01:: had elected Republican candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: in the past two years---year%1:28:01:: .
There was no doubt as to the control---control%1:26:00:: the Republican party---group%1:03:00:: exercised throughout the state---state%1:15:01:: .
If it failed on occasion to elect its candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: for general state---state%1:15:01:: offices---office%1:26:00:: by majorities---majority%1:07:00:: , the failure---failure%1:04:00:: was due to a lingering remnant---remnant%1:24:00:: of the Know-Nothing party---party%1:14:01:: , which called itself the American Republican party---group%1:03:00:: .
The American Republicans---person%1:03:00:: and the Republicans---republican%1:18:00:: both nominated lieutenant-governor---lieutenant_governor%1:18:00:: Turner---person%1:03:00:: for governor---governor%1:18:00:: .
Elisha R. Potter---person%1:03:00:: was the Democratic candidate---candidate%1:18:01:: .
The results---result%1:19:00:: of the election---election%1:04:01:: of 1859 found Republican candidates---candidate%1:18:01:: not only winning the offices---office%1:04:01:: of governor---governor%1:18:00:: and lieutenant-governor---lieutenant_governor%1:18:00:: but also obtaining the two Congressional offices---office%1:14:01:: from the eastern and western sections---section%1:15:01:: of the state---state%1:15:01:: .
During the month---month%1:28:01:: of November---november%1:28:00:: hardly a day---day%1:28:00:: passed when there was not some mention---mention%1:10:01:: of John Brown---person%1:03:00:: in the Rhode Island---rhode_island%1:15:00:: newspapers---newspaper%1:10:00:: .
On November---november%1:28:00:: 7 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal---group%1:03:00:: reprinted a letter---letter%1:10:00:: sent to John Brown---person%1:03:00:: from `` E. B.---person%1:03:00:: '' , a Quaker---quaker%1:18:00:: lady---lady%1:18:02:: in Newport---newport%1:15:00:: .
In reference to Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's raid---raid%1:04:00:: she wrote , `` though we are non-resistants---non-resistant%1:18:00:: and religiously believe it better to reform by moral and not by carnal weapons---weapon%1:06:00:: we know thee was anemated [ sic ] by the most generous and philanthropic motives---motive%1:03:00:: '' .
`` E. B.---person%1:03:00:: '' compared John Brown---person%1:03:00:: to Moses---moses%1:18:00:: in that they were both acting to deliver millions from oppression---oppression%1:04:00:: .
In contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: to `` E. B.---person%1:03:00:: '' , most Rhode Islanders---rhode_islander%1:18:00:: hardly thought of John Brown---person%1:03:00:: as being another Moses---person%1:03:00:: .
Most attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: to develop any sympathy---sympathy%1:09:00:: for Brown---person%1:03:00:: and his actions---action%1:04:02:: found an unresponsive audience---audience%1:14:01:: in Rhode Island---rhode_island%1:15:00:: .
On Wednesday---wednesday%1:28:00:: evening---evening%1:28:00:: , November---november%1:28:00:: 23 , 1859 , in Warren---location%1:03:00:: , Rev. Mark Trafton---person%1:03:00:: of New Bedford---location%1:03:00:: , gave a `` Mission of Sympathy '' lecture---lecture%1:10:00:: in which he favorably viewed the Harper 's Ferry---location%1:03:00:: insurrection---insurrection%1:04:00:: .
The Warren Telegraph---group%1:03:00:: stated that many of Rev. Trafton---person%1:03:00:: 's remarks---remark%1:10:00:: were inappropriate and savored strongly of radicalism---radicalism%1:09:00:: and fanaticism---fanaticism%1:09:00:: .
In its account---account%1:10:03:: of the Trafton---person%1:03:00:: lecture---lecture%1:10:00:: , the Providence Daily Post---group%1:03:00:: said that the remarks---remark%1:10:00:: of Rev. Trafton---person%1:03:00:: made the people---people%1:14:00:: indignant .
No sympathy---sympathy%1:09:00:: or admiration---admiration%1:12:01:: for Brown---person%1:03:00:: could be found in the Providence Daily Post---group%1:03:00:: , for the editor---editor%1:18:00:: claimed that there were a score---score%1:14:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: in the state prison---state_prison%1:06:00:: who were a thousand times---time%1:28:00:: more deserving of sympathy---sympathy%1:09:00:: .
The Providence Daily Journal---group%1:03:00:: , however , stated that Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's courage---courage%1:07:00:: , bravery---bravery%1:07:00:: , and heroism---heroism%1:07:00:: `` in a good cause---cause%1:04:01:: would make a man---man%1:18:00:: a martyr---martyr%1:18:00:: ; it gives something of dignity---dignity%1:07:00:: even to a bad one '' .
The Woonsocket Patriot---group%1:03:00:: admitted that John Brown---person%1:03:00:: might deserve punishment---punishment%1:04:00:: or imprisonment---imprisonment%1:04:01:: `` but he should no more be hung than Henry A. Wise---person%1:03:00:: or James Buchanan---person%1:03:00:: '' .
The Newport Mercury---group%1:03:00:: exhibited more concern---concern%1:09:01:: over the possibility---possibility%1:09:03:: of the abolitionists---abolitionist%1:18:00:: making a martyr---martyr%1:18:00:: of Brown---person%1:03:00:: than it did over the development---development%1:22:02:: of sympathy---sympathy%1:09:00:: for him .
In her letter---letter%1:10:00:: to John Brown---person%1:03:00:: , `` E. B.---person%1:03:00:: '' , the Quakeress from Newport---newport%1:15:00:: , had suggested that the American people---people%1:14:00:: owed more honor---honor%1:10:00:: to John Brown---person%1:03:00:: for seeking to free the slaves---slave%1:18:00:: than they did to George Washington---person%1:03:00:: .
During the latter days---day%1:28:01:: of November---november%1:28:00:: to the day---day%1:28:01:: of Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's execution---execution%1:04:00:: , it seems that most Rhode Islanders---rhode_islander%1:18:00:: did not concur in `` E. B.---person%1:03:00:: 's '' suggestion---suggestion%1:09:00:: .
On November---november%1:28:00:: 22 , 1859 , the Providence Daily Journal---group%1:03:00:: stated that although Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's `` pluck---pluck%1:07:00:: '' and honest fanaticism---fanaticism%1:09:00:: must be admired , any honor---honor%1:10:00:: paid to Brown---person%1:03:00:: would only induce other fanatics---fanatic%1:18:00:: to imitate his actions---action%1:04:02:: .
A week---week%1:28:00:: later the Daily Journal---group%1:03:00:: had discovered the initial plans---plan%1:09:00:: of some Providence---providence%1:15:00:: citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: to hold a meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: honoring John Brown---person%1:03:00:: on the day---day%1:28:01:: of his execution---execution%1:04:00:: .
The editor---editor%1:18:00:: of the Daily Journal---group%1:03:00:: warned , `` that if such a demonstration---demonstration%1:04:01:: be made , it will not find support---support%1:09:00:: or countenance---countenance%1:10:00:: from any of the men---man%1:18:00:: whose names---name%1:10:00:: are recognized as having a right---right%1:07:00:: to speak for Providence---providence%1:15:00:: '' .
The Providence Daily Post---group%1:03:00:: 's editor---editor%1:18:00:: wrote that he could not believe that a meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: honoring Brown---person%1:03:00:: was to be held in Providence---providence%1:15:00:: .
He further called upon the people---people%1:14:00:: of Providence---providence%1:15:00:: to rebuke the meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: and avoid disgrace---disgrace%1:26:00:: .
On December---december%1:28:00:: 2 , 1859 , John Brown---person%1:03:00:: was hanged at Charles Town---location%1:03:00:: , Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: .
Extraordinary precautions---precaution%1:04:00:: were taken so that no stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: be allowed in the city---city%1:15:00:: and no citizen---citizen%1:18:00:: within the enclosure---enclosure%1:06:00:: surrounding the scaffold---scaffold%1:06:01:: .
In many Northern towns---town%1:15:00:: and cities---city%1:15:00:: meetings---meeting%1:14:00:: were held and church bells---church_bell%1:06:00:: were tolled .
Such was not the case---case%1:09:00:: in Rhode Island---rhode_island%1:15:00:: .
The only public demonstration---demonstration%1:04:01:: in honor---honor%1:10:00:: of John Brown---person%1:03:00:: was held at Pratt 's Hall---location%1:03:00:: in Providence---location%1:03:00:: , on the day---day%1:28:01:: of his execution---execution%1:04:00:: .
Despite the opposition---opposition%1:04:01:: of the city---city%1:15:00:: newspapers---newspaper%1:14:00:: , the Pratt Hall---location%1:03:00:: meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: `` brought together a very respectable audience---audience%1:14:00:: , composed in part of those who had been distinguished for years---year%1:28:01:: for their radical views---view%1:09:02:: upon the subject---subject%1:09:01:: of slavery---slavery%1:26:00:: , of many of our colored citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: , and of those who were attracted to the place---place%1:15:00:: by the novelty---novelty%1:07:00:: of such a gathering---gathering%1:14:00:: '' .
Seated on the platform---platform%1:06:00:: were Amos C. Barstow---person%1:03:00:: , ex-mayor---ex-mayor%1:18:00:: of Providence---providence%1:15:00:: and a wealthy Republican stove---stove%1:06:00:: manufacturer---manufacturer%1:18:00:: ; Thomas Davis---person%1:03:00:: , an uncompromising Garrisonian---person%1:03:00:: ; the Reverend Augustus Woodbury---person%1:03:00:: , a Unitarian---unitarian%1:18:00:: minister---minister%1:18:00:: ; the Reverend George T. Day---person%1:03:00:: , a Free-Will Baptist---baptist%1:18:00:: ; Daniel w. Vaughan---person%1:03:00:: , and William H. H. Clements---person%1:03:00:: .
The latter two were appointed secretaries---secretary%1:18:01:: .
The first speaker---speaker%1:18:00:: was Amos C. Barstow---person%1:03:00:: who had been unanimously chosen president---president%1:18:03:: of the meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: .
He spoke of his desire---desire%1:12:00:: to promote the abolition---abolition%1:04:00:: of slavery---slavery%1:26:00:: by peaceable means---means%1:04:00:: and he compared John Brown---person%1:03:00:: of Harper 's Ferry---location%1:03:00:: to the John Brown---person%1:03:00:: of Rhode Island---rhode_island%1:15:00:: 's colonial period---period%1:28:00:: .
Barstow---person%1:03:00:: concluded that as Rhode Island---rhode_island%1:15:00:: 's John Brown---person%1:03:00:: became a canonized hero---hero%1:18:00:: , if not a saint---saint%1:18:03:: , so would it be with John Brown---person%1:03:00:: of Harper 's Ferry---location%1:03:00:: .
The next speaker---speaker%1:18:00:: was George T. Day---person%1:03:00:: .
Although admitting Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's guilt---guilt%1:26:00:: on legal grounds---grounds%1:09:00:: , Day---person%1:03:00:: said that , `` Brown---person%1:03:00:: is no common criminal---criminal%1:18:00:: ; his deed was not below , but above the law---law%1:14:00:: '' .
Following Day---person%1:03:00:: was Woodbury---person%1:03:00:: who spoke of his disapproval---disapproval%1:12:00:: of Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: at servile insurrection---insurrection%1:04:00:: , his admiration---admiration%1:12:01:: of Brown---person%1:03:00:: 's character---character%1:07:01:: , and his opposition---opposition%1:04:01:: to slavery---slavery%1:26:00:: .
Woodbury---person%1:03:00:: 's remarks---remark%1:10:00:: were applauded by a portion---portion%1:24:00:: of the audience---audience%1:14:00:: several times---time%1:11:00:: and once there was hissing---hissing%1:11:00:: .
The fourth and last speaker---speaker%1:18:00:: was Thomas Davis---person%1:03:00:: .
By this time---time%1:11:00:: large numbers---large_number%1:23:00:: of the audience---audience%1:14:00:: had left the hall---hall%1:06:02:: .
Davis---person%1:03:00:: commenced his remarks---remark%1:10:00:: by an allusion---allusion%1:10:00:: to the general feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: of opposition---opposition%1:04:01:: which the meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: had encountered from many of the citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: and all the newspapers---newspaper%1:14:00:: of the city---city%1:15:00:: .
He said that the propriety---propriety%1:07:00:: or impropriety---impropriety%1:07:00:: of such a gathering---gathering%1:14:00:: was a question---question%1:10:01:: that was to be settled by every man---man%1:18:00:: in accordance---accordance%1:10:00:: with the convictions---conviction%1:09:00:: of private judgments---judgment%1:04:02:: .
In the remainder---remainder%1:24:00:: of his speech---speech%1:10:01:: Davis---person%1:03:00:: spoke of his admiration---admiration%1:12:01:: for Brown---person%1:03:00:: and warned those who took part in the meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: that they `` are liable to the charge---charge%1:10:00:: that they are supporting---supporting%1:04:00:: traitors---traitor%1:18:00:: and upholding men---man%1:18:04:: whom the laws---law%1:10:00:: have condemned '' .
He recalled that in Rhode Island---rhode_island%1:15:00:: a party---party%1:18:00:: opposed to the state---state%1:15:01:: 's condemnation---condemnation%1:10:00:: of a man---man%1:18:00:: ( Thomas W. Dorr---person%1:03:00:: ) proclaimed the state---state%1:15:01:: 's action---action%1:04:02:: as a violation---violation%1:04:00:: of the law---law%1:14:00:: of the land---land%1:15:01:: and the principles---principle%1:09:01:: of human liberty---liberty%1:26:01:: .
At the close---close%1:28:00:: of Davis---person%1:03:00:: ' speech---speech%1:10:01:: the following preamble---preamble%1:10:00:: and resolutions---resolution%1:10:01:: were read by the president---president%1:18:03:: , and on the question---question%1:10:01:: of their adoption---adoption%1:04:00:: passed unanimously :
Whereas , John Brown---person%1:03:00:: has cheerfully risked his life---life%1:26:00:: in endeavoring to deliver those who are denied all rights---right%1:07:00:: and is this day---day%1:28:01:: doomed to suffer death---death%1:26:00:: for his efforts---effort%1:04:00:: in behalf---behalf%1:07:00:: of those who have no helper---helper%1:18:00:: :
Resolved that , while we most decidedly disapprove the methods he adopted to accomplish his objects---object%1:09:00:: , yet in his willingness---willingness%1:07:00:: to die in aid---aid%1:04:00:: of the great cause---cause%1:04:01:: of human freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: , we still recognize the qualities---quality%1:07:00:: of a noble nature---nature%1:07:02:: and the exercise---exercise%1:04:03:: of a spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: which true men---man%1:18:00:: have always admired and which history---history%1:09:01:: never fails to honor .
Resolved that his wrongs---wrong%1:04:00:: and bereavements---bereavement%1:26:00:: in Kansas---kansas%1:15:00:: , occasioned by the violence---violence%1:04:01:: and brutality---brutality%1:07:00:: of those who were intent on the propagation---propagation%1:10:00:: of slavery---slavery%1:26:00:: in that territory---territory%1:15:00:: , call for a charitable judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: upon his recent efforts---effort%1:04:00:: in Virginia---virginia%1:15:00:: to undermine the despotism---despotism%1:26:00:: from which he had suffered , and commend his family---family%1:14:00:: to the special sympathy---sympathy%1:24:00:: and aid---aid%1:21:00:: of all who pity suffering---suffering%1:26:01:: and reverence justice---justice%1:07:00:: .
Resolved that the anti slavery---slavery%1:26:00:: sentiment---sentiment%1:09:00:: is becoming ripe for resolute action---action%1:04:02:: .
Resolved , that we find in this fearful tragedy---tragedy%1:11:00:: at Harper 's Ferry---location%1:03:00:: a reason---reason%1:16:00:: for more earnest effort---effort%1:04:00:: to remove the evil---evil%1:07:00:: of slavery---slavery%1:26:00:: from the whole land---land%1:15:02:: as speedily as possible .
On the morning---morning%1:28:00:: following the Pratt Hall---location%1:03:00:: meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: the editor---editor%1:18:00:: of the Providence Daily Journal---group%1:03:00:: wrote that although the meeting---meeting%1:14:00:: was milder and less extreme than those held in other areas---area%1:15:01:: for similar purposes---purpose%1:09:00:: , it could have been avoided completely .
The nuclear war---war%1:26:00:: is already being fought , except that the bombs---bomb%1:06:00:: are not being dropped on enemy targets---target%1:15:00:: - not yet .
It is being fought , moreover , in fairly close correspondence---correspondence%1:10:00:: with the predictions---prediction%1:09:00:: of the soothsayers---soothsayer%1:18:00:: of the think factories---think_factory%1:14:00:: .
They predicted escalation---escalation%1:04:00:: , and escalation---escalation%1:04:00:: is what we are getting .
The biggest nuclear device---device%1:06:00:: the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: has exploded measured some 15 megatons---megaton%1:23:02:: , although our B-52s---b-52%1:06:00:: are said to be carrying two 20 - megaton bombs---megaton_bomb%1:06:00:: apiece .
Some time---time%1:28:05:: ago , however , Mr. Khrushchev---person%1:03:00:: decided that when bigger bombs---bomb%1:06:00:: were made , the Soviet Union---soviet_union%1:15:00:: would make them .
He seems to have at least a few 30 - and 50 - megaton bombs---megaton_bomb%1:06:00:: on hand , since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock---stock%1:21:01:: .
And now , of course , the hue and cry---hue_and_cry%1:10:00:: for counter escalation---escalation%1:04:00:: is being raised on our side---side%1:14:00:: .
Khrushchev---person%1:03:00:: threatens us with a 100 - megaton bomb---megaton_bomb%1:06:00:: ?
So be it - then we must embark on a crash program---program%1:09:00:: for 200 - megaton bombs---megaton_bomb%1:06:00:: of the common or hydrogen---hydrogen%1:27:00:: variety , and neutron bombs---neutron_bomb%1:06:00:: , which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing---thing%1:06:00:: .
So escalation---escalation%1:04:00:: proceeds , ad infinitum or , more accurately , until the contestants---contestant%1:18:00:: begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds---proving_ground%1:06:00:: .
What is needed , Philip Morrison---person%1:03:00:: writes in The Cornell Daily Sun ( October---october%1:28:00:: 26 ) is a discontinuity---discontinuity%1:26:00:: .
The escalation---escalation%1:04:00:: must end sometime , and probably quite soon .
`` Only a discontinuity---discontinuity%1:26:00:: can end it '' , Professor Morrison---person%1:03:00:: writes .
`` The discontinuity---discontinuity%1:26:00:: can either be that of war---war%1:26:00:: to destruction---destruction%1:04:00:: , or that of diplomatic policy---policy%1:09:00:: '' .
Morrison---person%1:03:00:: points out that since our country---country%1:15:00:: is more urbanized than the Soviet Union---soviet_union%1:15:00:: or Red China---red_china%1:15:00:: , it is the most vulnerable of the great powers---great_power%1:14:00:: - Europe---europe%1:17:00:: of course must be written off out of hand .
He feels , therefore , that to seek a discontinuity---discontinuity%1:26:00:: in the arms---arms%1:06:00:: policy---policy%1:09:00:: of the United States---united_states%1:14:00:: is the least risky path---path%1:04:00:: our government---government%1:14:00:: can take .
His proposal---proposal%1:10:00:: is opposed to that of Richard Nixon---person%1:03:00:: , Governor Rockefeller---person%1:03:00:: , past chairmen---chairman%1:18:01:: Strauss---person%1:03:00:: and McCone---person%1:03:00:: of the Atomic Energy Commission---group%1:03:00:: , Dr. Edward Teller---person%1:03:00:: and those others now enjoying their hour---hour%1:28:01:: of triumph---triumph%1:12:00:: in the exacerbation---exacerbation%1:04:01:: of the cold war---cold_war%1:26:00:: .
These gentlemen---gentleman%1:18:00:: are calling for a resumption---resumption%1:04:00:: of testing---testing%1:04:00:: - in the atmosphere---atmosphere%1:15:00:: - on the greatest possible scale---scale%1:24:00:: , all in the name of national security---security%1:26:00:: .
Escalation---escalation%1:04:00:: is their first love---love%1:09:00:: and their last ; they will be faithful unto death---death%1:28:00:: .
Capable as their minds---mind%1:09:00:: may be in some directions---direction%1:15:00:: , these guardians---guardian%1:18:00:: of the nation---nation%1:14:00:: 's security---security%1:26:00:: are incapable of learning , or even of observing .
If this capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: had not failed them , they would see that their enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: has made a disastrous miscalculation---miscalculation%1:04:00:: .
He has gained only one thing---thing%1:09:01:: - he has exploded a 50 - megaton bomb---megaton_bomb%1:06:00:: and he probably has rockets---rocket%1:06:01:: with sufficient thrust---thrust%1:19:00:: to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges---range%1:15:01:: .
But if his purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: was to inspire terror---terror%1:12:00:: , his action---action%1:04:02:: could hardly have miscarried more obviously .
Not terror---terror%1:12:00:: , but anger---anger%1:12:00:: and resentment---resentment%1:12:00:: have been the general reaction---reaction%1:09:00:: outside the Soviet sphere---sphere%1:15:00:: .
Khrushchev---person%1:03:00:: himself is reported to be concerned by the surge---surge%1:04:00:: of animosity---animosity%1:12:00:: he has aroused , yet our own nuclear statesmen---statesman%1:18:00:: seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps---footstep%1:04:00:: .
When one powerful nation---nation%1:14:00:: strives to emulate the success---success%1:26:00:: of another , it is only natural .
Thus , when the Russians---russian%1:18:00:: sent up their first sputnik---sputnik%1:06:00:: , American chagrin---chagrin%1:12:00:: was human enough , and American determination---determination%1:07:00:: to put American satellites---satellite%1:06:00:: into orbit---orbit%1:15:00:: was perfectly understandable .
But to imitate an opponent---opponent%1:18:02:: when he has made the mistake---mistake%1:04:00:: of his life---life%1:28:01:: would be a new high---high%1:07:00:: in statesmanlike folly---folly%1:04:01:: .
When East Germans---east_german%1:18:00:: fled to the West---west%1:15:00:: by the thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: , paeans---paean%1:10:00:: of joy---joy%1:12:00:: rose from the throats---throat%1:08:00:: of Western publicists---publicist%1:18:00:: .
They are less vocal now , when it is the West Berliners---west_berliner%1:18:00:: who are migrating .
The flood---flood%1:04:01:: is not as great - only 700 a week---week%1:28:00:: according to one apparently conservative account---account%1:10:03:: - but it is symptomatic .
West Berlin---location%1:03:00:: morale---morale%1:07:00:: is low and , in age---age%1:07:00:: distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: , the situation---situation%1:26:00:: is unfavorable .
Nearly 18 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: of West Berlin---location%1:03:00:: 's 2200000 residents---resident%1:18:00:: are sixty-five or older , only 12.8 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: are under fifteen .
R. H. S. Crossman---person%1:03:00:: , M.P. , writing in The Manchester Guardian , states that departures---departure%1:04:00:: from West Berlin---location%1:03:00:: are now running at the rate---rate%1:28:00:: not of 700 , but of 1700 a week---week%1:28:00:: , and applications---application%1:10:00:: to leave have risen to 1900 a week---week%1:28:00:: .
The official statistics---statistic%1:09:00:: show that 60 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: are employed workers---worker%1:18:00:: or independent professional people---people%1:14:00:: .
Whole families---family%1:14:02:: are moving and removal firms---removal_firm%1:14:00:: are booked for months---month%1:28:00:: ahead .
The weekly loss---loss%1:21:01:: is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals---arrival%1:18:00:: each week from West Germany---location%1:03:00:: , but the hard truth---truth%1:09:00:: , says Crossman---person%1:03:00:: , is that `` The closing off---closing_off%1:04:00:: of East Berlin---location%1:03:00:: without interference---interference%1:10:00:: from the West---west%1:15:00:: and with the use---use%1:04:00:: only of East German , as distinct from Russian , troops---troops%1:14:00:: was a major Communist victory---victory%1:11:00:: , which dealt West Berlin---location%1:03:00:: a deadly , possibly a fatal , blow---blow%1:04:01:: .
The gallant half---half%1:23:00:: city---city%1:15:00:: is dying on its feet '' .
Another piece---piece%1:06:00:: of evidence---evidence%1:10:01:: appears in a dispatch---dispatch%1:10:00:: from Bonn---bonn%1:15:00:: in the Observer ( London---london%1:15:00:: ) .
Mark Arnold-Foster---person%1:03:00:: writes : `` People---people%1:14:00:: are leaving [ West Berlin---location%1:03:00:: ] because they think it is dying .
They are leaving so fast that the president---president%1:18:01:: of the West German Employers' Federation---location%1:03:00:: issued an appeal---appeal%1:10:00:: this week---week%1:28:00:: to factory workers---factory_worker%1:18:00:: in the West---west%1:15:00:: to volunteer for six months---month%1:28:00:: ' front-line---front_line%1:15:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: in factories---factory%1:06:00:: in West Berlin---location%1:03:00:: .
Berlin---berlin%1:15:00:: 's resilience---resilience%1:07:00:: is amazing , but if it has to hire its labor---labor%1:04:00:: in the West---west%1:15:00:: the struggle---struggle%1:04:01:: will be hard indeed '' .
The handwriting---handwriting%1:10:00:: is on the wall .
The only hope---hope%1:09:00:: for West Berlin---location%1:03:00:: lies in a compromise---compromise%1:04:00:: which will bring down the wall---wall%1:06:00:: and reunite the city---city%1:15:00:: .
State Department---state_department%1:14:00:: officials---official%1:18:01:: refusing to show their passes---pass%1:10:01:: at the boundary---boundary%1:15:00:: , and driving two blocks---block%1:15:00:: into East Berlin---location%1:03:00:: under military escort---escort%1:18:01:: , will not avail .
Tanks---tank%1:06:01:: lined up at the border---border%1:15:00:: will be no more helpful .
The materials---material%1:10:00:: for compromise---compromise%1:04:00:: are at hand : The Nation , Walter Lippmann---person%1:03:00:: and other sober commentators---commentator%1:18:01:: ( see Alan Clark---person%1:03:00:: on p. 367 ) have spelled them out again and again .
A compromise---compromise%1:04:00:: will leave both sides---side%1:14:00:: without the glow---glow%1:26:00:: of triumph---triumph%1:12:00:: , but it will save Berlin---location%1:03:00:: .
Or the city---city%1:15:00:: can be a graveyard---graveyard%1:15:00:: monument---monument%1:06:00:: to Western intransigence---intransigence%1:07:00:: , if that is what the West---west%1:15:00:: wants .
The removal---removal%1:04:00:: of Stalin---person%1:03:00:: 's body---body%1:08:00:: from the mausoleum---mausoleum%1:06:00:: he shared with Lenin---person%1:03:00:: to less distinguished quarters---quarters%1:06:00:: in the Kremlin---location%1:03:00:: wall---wall%1:06:00:: is not unprecedented in history---history%1:28:00:: .
It is , in fact , a relatively mild chastisement---chastisement%1:04:00:: of the dead---dead%1:14:00:: .
A British writer---writer%1:18:00:: , Richard Haestier---person%1:03:00:: , in a book---book%1:10:00:: , Dead Men Tell Tales , recalls that in the turmoil---turmoil%1:26:00:: preceding French Revolution---french_revolution%1:04:00:: the body---body%1:08:00:: of Henry /4---person%1:03:00:: , , who had died nearly 180 years---year%1:28:01:: earlier , was torn to pieces---piece%1:06:00:: by a mob---mob%1:14:00:: .
And in England---location%1:03:00:: , after the Restoration---restoration%1:28:00:: , the body---body%1:08:00:: of Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn---location%1:03:00:: .
The head---head%1:08:00:: was then fixed on a pole---pole%1:06:00:: at Westminster---location%1:03:00:: , and the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the body---body%1:08:00:: was buried under the gallows---gallows%1:06:00:: .
Contemplating these posthumous punishments---punishment%1:04:00:: , Stalin---person%1:03:00:: should not lose all hope---hope%1:12:00:: .
In 1899 , Parliament---group%1:03:00:: erected a statue---statue%1:06:00:: to Cromwell---person%1:03:00:: in Westminster---location%1:03:00:: , facing Whitehall---location%1:03:00:: and there , presumably , he still stands .
Nikita Khrushchev---person%1:03:00:: , however , has created yet another problem---problem%1:26:00:: for himself .
The Lenin---person%1:03:00:: tomb---tomb%1:06:00:: is obviously adequate for double occupancy---occupancy%1:04:00:: , Moscow---moscow%1:15:00:: is a crowded city---city%1:15:00:: , and the creed---creed%1:09:00:: of communism---communism%1:09:00:: deplores waste---waste%1:04:00:: .
Who will take Stalin---person%1:03:00:: 's place---place%1:26:01:: beside Lenin---person%1:03:00:: ?
There is Karl Marx---person%1:03:00:: , of course , buried in London---london%1:15:00:: .
The Macmillan---person%1:03:00:: government---government%1:14:00:: might be willing to let him go , but he has been dead seventy-eight years---year%1:28:01:: and even the Soviet morticians---mortician%1:18:00:: could not make him look presentable .
Who , then , is of sufficient stature---stature%1:26:00:: to lodge with Lenin---person%1:03:00:: ?
Who but Nikita---person%1:03:00:: himself ?
Since he has just shown who is top dog---top_dog%1:18:00:: , he may not be ready to receive this highest honor---honor%1:10:00:: in the gift---gift%1:04:00:: of the Soviet people---people%1:14:00:: .
Besides , he can hardly avoid musing on the instability---instability%1:07:01:: of death---death%1:19:00:: which , what with exhumations---exhumation%1:04:00:: and rehabilitations---rehabilitation%1:04:00:: , seems to match that of life---life%1:26:00:: .
Suppose he did lie beside Lenin---person%1:03:00:: , would it be permanent ?
If some future Khrushchev---person%1:03:00:: decided to rake up the misdeeds---misdeed%1:04:00:: of his revered predecessor---predecessor%1:18:00:: , would not the factory workers---factory_worker%1:18:00:: pass the same resolutions---resolution%1:09:01:: applauding his dispossession---dispossession%1:04:00:: ?
When a man---man%1:05:01:: is laid to rest , he is entitled to stay put .
If Nikita---person%1:03:00:: buys a small plot---plot%1:15:00:: in some modest rural cemetery---cemetery%1:15:00:: , everyone will understand .
The appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U.N.'s Acting Secretary General - at this writing , the choice appears to be certain - offers further proof that in politics---politics%1:24:00:: it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends .
The appointment---appointment%1:04:00:: of U Thant---person%1:03:00:: of Burma---burma%1:15:00:: as the U.N.'s---group%1:03:00:: Acting Secretary General---secretary_general%1:18:00:: - at this writing---writing%1:04:02:: , the choice---choice%1:04:00:: appears to be certain - offers further proof---proof%1:09:00:: that in politics---politics%1:04:00:: it is more important to have no influential enemies---enemy%1:18:00:: than to have influential friends---friend%1:18:00:: .
Mongi Slim---person%1:03:00:: of Tunisia---tunisia%1:15:00:: and Frederick Boland---person%1:03:00:: of Ireland---ireland%1:15:01:: were early favorites---favorite%1:09:00:: in the running , but France---france%1:15:00:: did n't like the former and the Soviet Union---soviet_union%1:15:00:: would have none of the latter .
With the neutralists---neutralist%1:18:00:: maintaining pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: for one of their own to succeed Mr. Hammarskjold---person%1:03:00:: , U Thant---person%1:03:00:: emerged as the only possible candidate---candidate%1:18:00:: unlikely to be waylaid by a veto---veto%1:04:00:: .
What is interesting is that his positive qualifications---qualification%1:07:00:: for the post---post%1:04:00:: were revealed only as a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of tail---tail%1:28:00:: to his candidacy---candidacy%1:04:00:: .
In all the bitter in-fighting---in-fighting%1:04:01:: , the squabbles---squabble%1:10:00:: over election---election%1:04:01:: procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: , the complicated numbers game---numbers_game%1:04:00:: that East---east%1:15:00:: and West---west%1:15:00:: played on the assistant secretaries---secretary%1:18:01:: ' theme---theme%1:10:00:: , the gentleman---gentleman%1:18:00:: from Burma---burma%1:15:00:: showed himself both as a man---man%1:18:00:: of principle---principle%1:09:01:: and a skilled diplomat---diplomat%1:18:00:: .
He has , moreover , another qualification---qualification%1:07:00:: which augurs well for the future---future%1:28:00:: .
He is a Buddhist---buddhist%1:18:00:: , which means that to him peace---peace%1:26:00:: and the sanctity---sanctity%1:07:00:: of human life---life%1:26:00:: are not only religious dogma---dogma%1:10:00:: , but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung---weltanschauung%1:09:00:: .
U Thant---person%1:03:00:: of course , will hold office---office%1:26:00:: until the spring---spring%1:28:00:: of 1963 , when Mr. Hammarskjold---person%1:03:00:: 's term---term%1:28:00:: would have come to an end---end%1:09:00:: .
Whether the compromises---compromise%1:04:00:: - on both sides---side%1:14:00:: - that made possible the interim appointment---appointment%1:04:00:: can then be repeated remains to be seen .
Mr. Khrushchev---person%1:03:00:: 's demand---demand%1:10:00:: for a troika---troika%1:06:00:: is dormant , not dead ; the West---west%1:15:00:: may or not remain satisfied with the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of neutralism---neutralism%1:10:00:: that U Thant---person%1:03:00:: represents .
In a sense , the showdown---showdown%1:10:00:: promised by Mr. Hammarskjold---person%1:03:00:: 's sudden and tragic death---death%1:11:00:: has been avoided ; no precedents---precedent%1:09:00:: have been set as yet ; structurally , the U.N.---group%1:03:00:: is still fluid , vulnerable to the pressures---pressure%1:07:00:: that its new and enlarged membership---membership%1:14:00:: are bringing to bear upon it .
But at least the pessimists---pessimist%1:18:00:: who believed that the world organization---world_organization%1:14:00:: had plunged to its death---death%1:26:00:: in that plane---plane%1:06:01:: crash---crash%1:11:00:: in the Congo---congo%1:15:00:: have been proved wrong .
No one who has studied the radical Right---right%1:14:00:: can suppose that words---words%1:10:03:: are their sole staple---staple%1:06:00:: in trade---trade%1:04:00:: .
These are mentalities---mentality%1:09:01:: which crave action---action%1:04:02:: - and they are beginning to get it , as Messrs. Salsich---person%1:03:00:: and Engh---person%1:03:00:: report on page---page%1:10:00:: 372 .
Even in areas---area%1:09:00:: where political connotations---connotation%1:10:00:: are ( deliberately ? )
left vague , the spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: of vigilantism---vigilantism%1:04:00:: is spreading .
Friends , a picture---picture%1:10:00:: magazine---magazine%1:10:00:: distributed by Chevrolet---group%1:03:00:: dealers---dealer%1:14:00:: , describes a paramilitary organization---paramilitary_organization%1:14:00:: of employees---employee%1:18:00:: of the Gulf Telephone Company---group%1:03:00:: at Foley---location%1:03:00:: , Alabama---location%1:03:00:: .
`` If the day---day%1:28:03:: should ever come that foreign invaders---invader%1:18:00:: swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast---group%1:03:00:: '' , the account---account%1:10:04:: reads , `` they can count on heavy opposition---opposition%1:04:00:: from a group---group%1:03:00:: of commando---commando%1:18:00:: trained telephone---telephone%1:10:00:: employees---employee%1:18:00:: - all girls---girl%1:18:00:: .
Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast moving Civil Defense---civil_defense%1:04:00:: outfit---outfit%1:14:00:: , 23 operators---telephone_operator%1:18:00:: and office---office%1:14:01:: personnel---personnel%1:14:00:: stand ready to move into action---action%1:04:03:: at a minute---minute%1:28:00:: 's notice---notice%1:10:02:: '' .
According to Friends , the unit---unit%1:14:00:: was organized by John Snook---person%1:03:00:: , a former World War /2 , commando---commando%1:18:00:: who is vice president---vice_president%1:18:00:: and general manager---general_manager%1:18:00:: of the telephone company---telephone_company%1:14:00:: .
The girls---girl%1:18:00:: , very fetching in their uniforms---uniform%1:06:00:: , are shown firing rockets---rocket%1:06:01:: from a launcher---launcher%1:06:00:: mounted on a dump truck---dump_truck%1:06:00:: ; they are also trained with carbines---carbine%1:06:00:: , automatic weapons---weapon%1:06:00:: , pistols---pistol%1:06:00:: , rifles---rifle%1:06:00:: and other such ladies---lady%1:18:01:: ' accessories---accessory%1:06:01:: .
This may be opera bouffe---opera_bouffe%1:10:00:: now , but it will become more serious should the cold war---cold_war%1:26:00:: mount in frenzy---frenzy%1:26:00:: .
The country---country%1:14:00:: is committed to the doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: of security---security%1:26:00:: by military means---means%1:04:00:: .
The doctrine---doctrine%1:09:00:: has never worked ; it is not working now .
The official military establishment---establishment%1:14:00:: can only threaten to use its nuclear arms---arms%1:06:00:: ; it cannot bring them into actual play---play%1:26:00:: .
A more dangerous formula---formula%1:10:01:: for national frustration---frustration%1:12:00:: cannot be imagined .
As the civic temper---temper%1:12:01:: rises , the more naive citizens---citizen%1:18:00:: begin to play soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: - but the guns---gun%1:06:00:: are real .
Soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors---traitor%1:18:00:: they are assured are in our midst---midst%1:15:00:: .
( Los Angeles---los_angeles%1:15:00:: in 1957 finally bowed to the skyscraper---skyscraper%1:06:00:: . )
And without high density---density%1:07:01:: in the core---core%1:15:00:: , rapid-transit---rapid_transit%1:06:00:: systems---system%1:14:00:: cannot be maintained economically , let alone built from scratch at today 's prices---price%1:07:00:: .
However , the building---building%1:04:00:: of freeways---freeway%1:06:00:: and garages---garage%1:06:00:: cannot continue forever .
The new interchange---interchange%1:06:00:: among the four Los Angeles---los_angeles%1:15:00:: freeways---freeway%1:06:00:: , including the grade-constructed accesses---access%1:06:00:: , occupies by itself no less than eighty acres---acre%1:23:00:: of downtown land---land%1:21:01:: , one-eighth---one-eighth%1:23:00:: of a square mile---square_mile%1:23:00:: , an area---area%1:07:00:: about the size---size%1:07:00:: of Rockefeller Center---group%1:03:00:: in New York---new_york%1:15:01:: .
It is hard to believe that this mass---mass%1:14:02:: of intertwined concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: constitutes what the law---law%1:14:00:: calls `` the highest and best use---use%1:04:00:: '' of centrally located urban land---land%1:21:01:: .
As it affects the city---city%1:15:01:: 's fiscal situation---situation%1:26:00:: , such an interchange---interchange%1:06:00:: is ruinous ; it removes forever from the tax---tax%1:21:00:: rolls---roll%1:10:00:: property---property%1:21:00:: which should be taxed to pay for the city---city%1:15:01:: services---services%1:04:00:: .
Subways---subway%1:06:00:: improved land---land%1:21:01:: values---value%1:21:00:: without taking away land---land%1:21:01:: ; freeways---freeway%1:06:00:: boost valuation---valuation%1:09:00:: less ( because the garages---garage%1:06:00:: they require are not prime buildings---building%1:06:00:: by a long shot ) , and reduce the acreage---acreage%1:07:00:: that can be taxed .
Downtown Los Angeles---los_angeles%1:15:00:: is already two-thirds---two-thirds%1:23:00:: freeway---freeway%1:06:00:: , interchange---interchange%1:06:00:: , street---street%1:06:00:: , parking lot---parking_lot%1:15:00:: and garage---garage%1:06:00:: - one of those preposterous `` if '' statistics---statistic%1:09:00:: has already come to pass .
The freeway---freeway%1:06:00:: with narrowly spaced interchanges---interchange%1:06:00:: concentrates and mitigates the access---access%1:07:00:: problem---problem%1:26:00:: , but it also acts inevitably as an artificial , isolating boundary---boundary%1:15:00:: .
City---city%1:15:01:: planners---planner%1:18:00:: do not always use this boundary---boundary%1:15:00:: as effectively as they might .
Less ambitious freeway---freeway%1:06:00:: plans---plan%1:06:00:: may be more successful - especially when the roadways---roadway%1:06:00:: and interchanges---interchange%1:06:00:: are raised , allowing for cross access---access%1:06:00:: at many points---point%1:15:00:: and providing parking areas---parking_area%1:15:00:: below the ramp---ramp%1:06:00:: .
Meanwhile , the automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: and its friend---friend%1:18:00:: the truck---truck%1:06:00:: have cost the central city---central_city%1:15:00:: some of its industrial dominance---dominance%1:26:00:: .
In ever greater numbers---number%1:23:00:: , factories---factory%1:06:00:: are locating in the suburbs---suburb%1:15:00:: or in `` industrial parks---industrial_park%1:15:00:: '' removed from the city---city%1:15:00:: 's political jurisdiction---jurisdiction%1:15:00:: .
The appeal---appeal%1:07:00:: of the suburb---suburb%1:15:00:: is particularly strong for heavy industry---industry%1:04:00:: , which must move bulky objects---object%1:03:00:: along a lengthy assembly line---assembly_line%1:06:00:: and wants enough land area---land_area%1:07:00:: to do the entire job---job%1:04:01:: on one floor---floor%1:06:01:: .
To light industry---industry%1:04:00:: , the economies---economy%1:09:01:: of being on one floor---floor%1:06:01:: are much slighter , but efficiency engineers---efficiency_engineer%1:18:00:: usually believe in them , and manufacturers---manufacturer%1:14:00:: looking for ways---way%1:04:01:: to cut costs---cost%1:21:00:: cannot be prevented from turning to efficiency engineers---efficiency_engineer%1:18:00:: .
This movement---movement%1:04:04:: of industry---industry%1:04:00:: away from the central cities---central_city%1:15:00:: is not so catastrophically new as some prophets---prophet%1:18:00:: seem to believe .
It is merely the latest example---example%1:09:00:: of the leapfrog---leapfrog%1:04:01:: growth---growth%1:22:01:: which formed the pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: of virtually all American cities---city%1:15:00:: .
The big factories---factory%1:06:00:: which are relatively near the centers---center%1:15:01:: of our cities---city%1:15:00:: - the rubber---rubber%1:27:00:: factories---factory%1:06:00:: in Akron---location%1:03:00:: , Chrysler---group%1:03:00:: 's Detroit---detroit%1:15:00:: plants---plant%1:06:01:: , U. S. Steel---group%1:03:00:: 's Pittsburgh---pittsburgh%1:15:00:: works---works%1:06:02:: - often began on these sites---site%1:15:00:: at a time when that was the edge---edge%1:15:00:: of the city---city%1:15:00:: , yet close to transport---transport%1:04:00:: ( river---river%1:17:00:: ) , storage---storage%1:04:01:: ( piers---pier%1:06:00:: ) and power---power%1:19:00:: ( river---river%1:17:00:: ) .
The `` leapfrog---leapfrog%1:04:01:: '' was a phenomenon---phenomenon%1:11:00:: of the railroad---railroad%1:06:00:: and the steam turbine---steam_turbine%1:06:00:: , and the time---time%1:28:00:: when the belts---belt%1:15:00:: of residence---residence%1:15:00:: surrounding the old factory---factory%1:06:00:: area---area%1:06:00:: were not yet blighted .
The truck---truck%1:06:00:: and the car---car%1:06:00:: gave the manufacturer---manufacturer%1:18:00:: a new degree of freedom---degree_of_freedom%1:09:00:: in selecting his plant---plant%1:06:01:: site---site%1:15:00:: .
Until internal combustion---internal_combustion%1:22:00:: became cheap , he had to be near a railroad siding---railroad_siding%1:06:00:: and a trolley line---trolley_line%1:06:00:: or an existing large community---community%1:14:00:: of lower-class homes---home%1:06:00:: .
The railroad siding---railroad_siding%1:06:00:: is still important - it is usually , though not always , true that long-haul---long_haul%1:04:00:: shipment---shipment%1:04:00:: by rail---rail%1:06:03:: is cheaper than trucking---trucking%1:04:00:: .
But anybody who promises a substantial volume---volume%1:07:03:: of business---business%1:04:01:: can get a railroad---railroad%1:06:00:: to run a short spur---spur%1:06:01:: to his plant---plant%1:06:01:: these days---day%1:28:03:: , and many businesses---business%1:14:00:: can live without the railroad---railroad%1:06:00:: .
And there are now many millions---million%1:23:00:: of workers---worker%1:18:00:: for whom the factory---factory%1:06:00:: with the big parking lot---parking_lot%1:15:00:: , which can be reached by driving across or against the usual pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: of rush hour---rush_hour%1:28:00:: traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: and grille---grille%1:06:02:: route---route%1:06:00:: bus lines---bus_line%1:06:00:: , is actually more convenient than the walk-to factory---factory%1:06:00:: .
Willow Run---group%1:03:00:: , General Electric---group%1:03:00:: 's enormous installations---installation%1:06:00:: at Louisville---location%1:03:00:: and Syracuse---location%1:03:00:: , the Pentagon---pentagon%1:06:00:: , Boeing---group%1:03:00:: in Seattle---location%1:03:00:: , Douglas---group%1:03:00:: and Lockheed---group%1:03:00:: in Los Angeles---los_angeles%1:15:00:: , the new automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: assembly---assembly%1:04:01:: plants---plant%1:06:01:: everywhere - none of these is substantially served by any sort---sort%1:09:00:: of conventional mass rapid transit---mass_rapid_transit%1:06:00:: .
They are all suburban plants---plant%1:06:01:: , relying on the roads---road%1:06:00:: to keep them supplied with workers---worker%1:18:00:: .
And wherever the new thruways---thruway%1:06:00:: go up their banks---bank%1:17:00:: are lined by neat glass---glass%1:27:00:: and metal---metal%1:27:00:: and colored brick---brick%1:06:00:: light industry---industry%1:04:00:: .
The drive---drive%1:04:00:: along Massachusetts---massachusetts%1:15:00:: ' Route 128---location%1:03:00:: , the by-pass---bypass%1:06:00:: which makes an arc---arc%1:25:00:: about twenty miles---mile%1:23:01:: from downtown Boston---boston%1:15:00:: , may be a vision---vision%1:09:03:: of the future---future%1:28:00:: .
The future---future%1:28:00:: could be worse .
The plants---plant%1:06:01:: along Route 128---location%1:03:00:: are mostly well designed and nicely set against the New England---new_england%1:15:00:: rocks---rock%1:17:01:: and trees---tree%1:20:00:: .
They can even be rather grand , like Edward Land---person%1:03:00:: 's monument---monument%1:06:00:: to the astonishing success---success%1:26:00:: of Polaroid---group%1:03:00:: .
But they deny the values---value%1:07:00:: of the city---city%1:15:00:: - the crowded , competitive , tolerant city---city%1:15:00:: , the `` melting pot---melting_pot%1:15:00:: '' which gave off so many of the most admirable American qualities---quality%1:07:00:: .
They are segregated businesses---business%1:14:00:: , combining again on one site---site%1:15:00:: the factory---factory%1:06:00:: and the office---office%1:06:00:: , drawing their work force---work_force%1:14:00:: from segregated communities---community%1:14:00:: .
It is interesting to note how many of the plants---plant%1:06:01:: on Massachusetts---massachusetts%1:15:00:: ' Route 128---location%1:03:00:: draw most of their income---income%1:21:00:: either from the government---government%1:14:00:: in non-competitive cost-plus arrangements---arrangement%1:14:00:: , or from the exploitation---exploitation%1:04:00:: of patents---patent%1:10:01:: which grant at least a partial monopoly---monopoly%1:26:01:: .
While the factories---factory%1:06:00:: were always the center---center%1:15:01:: of the labor market---labor_market%1:04:00:: , they were often on the city---city%1:15:00:: 's periphery---periphery%1:25:00:: .
In spreading the factories---factory%1:06:00:: even farther , the automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: may not have changed to any great extent---extent%1:07:00:: the growth---growth%1:22:01:: pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: of the cities---city%1:15:00:: .
Even the loss---loss%1:21:01:: of hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: business---business%1:04:02:: to the outskirt---outskirt%1:15:00:: 's motel---motel%1:06:00:: has been relatively painless ; the hotel-motel demarcation---demarcation%1:15:00:: is becoming harder to find every year .
What hurts most is the damage---damage%1:11:00:: the automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: has done to central-city---central_city%1:15:00:: retailing---retailing%1:04:00:: , especially in those cities---city%1:15:00:: where public transit---public_transit%1:06:00:: is feeble .
Some retailing---retailing%1:04:00:: , of course , always spreads with the population---population%1:14:00:: - grocery stores---grocery_store%1:06:00:: , drugstores---drugstore%1:06:00:: , local haberdasheries---haberdashery%1:06:01:: and dress shops---dress_shop%1:06:00:: , candy stores---candy_store%1:06:00:: and the like---the_like%1:09:00:: .
But whenever a major purchase---purchase%1:04:00:: was contemplated forty years---year%1:28:01:: ago - a new bedroom set---bedroom_set%1:14:00:: or a winter---winter%1:28:00:: coat---coat%1:06:00:: , an Easter---easter%1:28:00:: bonnet---bonnet%1:06:00:: , a bicycle---bicycle%1:06:00:: for Junior---junior%1:18:02:: - the family---family%1:14:02:: set off for the downtown department store---department_store%1:06:00:: , where the selection---selection%1:14:00:: would be greatest .
Department stores---department_store%1:06:00:: congregated in the `` one hundred per cent---percent%1:24:00:: location---location%1:03:00:: '' , where all the transit lines---transit_line%1:06:00:: converged .
These stores---store%1:06:00:: are still there , but the volume---volume%1:07:03:: of the `` downtown store---store%1:06:00:: '' has been on a relative decline---decline%1:22:02:: , while in many cities---city%1:15:00:: the suburban `` branch---branch%1:14:00:: '' sells more and more dry goods---drygoods%1:06:00:: .
If the retailer---retailer%1:18:00:: and hotelman---hotelman%1:18:00:: 's downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: unit---unit%1:24:00:: sales---sale%1:04:00:: have been decreasing , however , his dollar volume---dollar_volume%1:07:00:: continues to rise , and it is dollars---dollar%1:21:00:: which you put in the bank---bank%1:14:00:: .
In most discussions---discussion%1:10:02:: of this phenomenon---phenomenon%1:11:00:: , the figures---figure%1:21:00:: are substantially inflated .
No suburban shopping-center---shopping_center%1:06:00:: branch---branch%1:14:00:: - not even Hudson---hudson%1:17:00:: 's vast Northland---northland%1:15:00:: outside Detroit---detroit%1:15:00:: - does anything like the unit---unit%1:24:00:: volume---volume%1:07:03:: of business---business%1:04:01:: or carries anything like the variety---variety%1:07:00:: of merchandise---merchandise%1:06:00:: to be found in the home---home%1:15:03:: store---store%1:06:00:: .
Telephone orders---telephone_order%1:04:00:: distort the picture---picture%1:26:00:: :
the suburbanite---suburbanite%1:18:00:: naturally calls a local rather than a central city---city%1:15:00:: number---number%1:10:03:: if both are listed in an advertisement---advertisement%1:10:00:: , especially if the local call---local_call%1:10:00:: eliminates city---city%1:15:01:: sales tax---sales_tax%1:21:00:: .
The suburban branch---branch%1:14:00:: is thereby credited with a sale---sale%1:04:00:: which would have been made even if its glass---glass%1:06:00:: doors---door%1:07:00:: had never opened .
Accounting---accounting%1:09:00:: procedures---procedure%1:04:02:: which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead---overhead%1:21:00:: and warehouse---warehouse%1:06:00:: expense---expense%1:21:00:: to the main store---store%1:06:00:: make the branches---branch%1:14:00:: seem more profitable than they are .
In many cases---case%1:11:00:: that statement---statement%1:10:00:: `` We break even on our downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: operation---operation%1:04:06:: and make money---money%1:21:00:: on our branches---branch%1:14:00:: '' would be turned around if the cost analysis---cost_analysis%1:04:00:: were recalculated on terms---terms%1:26:00:: less prejudicial to the old store---store%1:06:00:: .
Fear---fear%1:12:00:: of the competition---competition%1:24:01:: - always a great motivating force---force%1:19:00:: in the American economy---economy%1:14:00:: - makes retailers---retailer%1:18:00:: who do not have suburban operations---operation%1:04:06:: exaggerate both the volume---volume%1:23:00:: and the profitability---profitability%1:07:00:: of their rival---rival%1:18:00:: 's shiny new branches---branch%1:14:00:: .
The fact---fact%1:10:01:: seems to be that very many large branch---branch%1:14:00:: stores---store%1:06:00:: are uneconomical , that the choice---choice%1:04:00:: of location---location%1:03:00:: in the suburbs---suburb%1:15:00:: is as important as it was downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: , and that even highly suburbanized cities---city%1:15:00:: will support only so many big branches---branch%1:14:00:: .
Moreover , the cost---cost%1:07:00:: of operations is always high in any new store---store%1:06:00:: , as the conservative bankers---banker%1:18:00:: who act as controllers---controller%1:18:00:: for retail giants---giant%1:14:00:: are beginning to discover .
When all has been said , however , the big branch---branch%1:14:00:: store---store%1:06:00:: remains a major break---break%1:11:00:: with history---history%1:28:00:: in the development---development%1:22:02:: of American retailing---retailing%1:04:00:: .
Just as the suburban factory---factory%1:06:00:: may be more convenient than the downtown plant---plant%1:06:01:: to the worker---worker%1:18:00:: with a car---car%1:06:00:: , the trip---trip%1:04:00:: to the shopping center---shopping_center%1:06:00:: may seem far easier than to the downtown department store---department_store%1:06:00:: , though both are the same distance---distance%1:07:00:: from home---home%1:15:04:: .
Indeed , there are some cities---city%1:15:00:: where the suburban shopping---shopping%1:04:00:: pulls customers---customer%1:18:00:: who are geographically much nearer to downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: .
Raymond Vernon---person%1:03:00:: reports---report%1:10:01:: that residents---resident%1:18:00:: of East St. Louis---location%1:03:00:: have been driving across the Mississippi---mississippi%1:17:00:: , through the heart---heart%1:15:00:: of downtown St. Louis---st._louis%1:15:00:: and out to the western suburbs---suburb%1:15:00:: for major shopping---shopping%1:04:00:: , simply because parking---parking%1:04:00:: is easier at the big branches---branch%1:14:00:: than it is in the heart---heart%1:15:00:: of town---town%1:15:00:: .
To the extent---extent%1:07:00:: that the problem---problem%1:26:00:: is merely parking---parking%1:04:00:: , an aggressive downtown management---management%1:14:00:: , like that of Lazarus Brothers---group%1:03:00:: in Columbus---columbus%1:15:00:: , Ohio---ohio%1:15:00:: , can fight back successfully by building a garage---garage%1:06:00:: on the lot---lot%1:15:00:: next door .
If the distant patron---patron%1:18:00:: of the suburban branch---branch%1:14:00:: has been frightened away from downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: by traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: problems---problem%1:26:00:: , however , the city---city%1:15:00:: store---store%1:06:00:: can only pressure the politicians---politician%1:18:01:: to do something about the highways---highway%1:06:00:: or await the completion---completion%1:04:00:: of the federal highway---highway%1:06:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: .
And if the affection---affection%1:12:00:: for the suburban branch---branch%1:14:00:: reflects a desire---desire%1:12:00:: to shop with `` nice people---people%1:14:00:: '' , rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass---mass%1:14:01:: which supports the downtown department store---department_store%1:06:00:: , the central location---location%1:03:00:: may be in serious trouble .
Today , according to land---land%1:21:01:: economist---economist%1:18:00:: Homer Hoyt---person%1:03:00:: , shopping centers---shopping_center%1:06:00:: and their associated parking lots---parking_lot%1:15:00:: cover some 46000 acres---acre%1:23:00:: of land---land%1:21:01:: , which is almost exactly the total land area---land_area%1:07:00:: in all the nation 's Central Business Districts---business_district%1:15:00:: put together .
The downtown store---store%1:06:00:: continues to offer the great inducement---inducement%1:16:00:: of variety---variety%1:14:01:: , both within its gates---gate%1:06:00:: and across the street---street%1:06:00:: , where other department stores---department_store%1:06:00:: are immediately convenient for the shopper---shopper%1:18:00:: who wants to see what is available before making up her mind .
If anything may be predicted in the quicksilver world---world%1:14:01:: of retailing---retailing%1:04:00:: , it seems likely that the suburban branch---branch%1:14:00:: will come to dominate children---child%1:18:00:: 's clothing---clothing%1:06:00:: ( taking the kid---kid%1:18:00:: downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: is too much of a production---production%1:04:00:: ) , household gadgetry---gadgetry%1:06:00:: and the discount business---discount_business%1:04:00:: in big-ticket items---item%1:06:00:: .
Department stores---department_store%1:06:00:: were built on dry goods---drygoods%1:06:00:: , especially ladies---lady%1:18:02:: ' fashions , and in this area---area%1:09:00:: , in the long run , the suburban branches---branch%1:14:00:: will be hard put to compete against downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: .
If this analysis---analysis%1:09:00:: is correct , the suburban branches---branch%1:14:00:: will turn out to be what management---management%1:14:00:: 's cost accountants---cost_accountant%1:18:00:: refuse to acknowledge , marginal operations---operation%1:04:06:: rather than major factors---factor%1:11:00:: .
Historically in America---america%1:15:00:: the appeal---appeal%1:07:00:: of cities---city%1:15:00:: has been their color---color%1:07:03:: and life---life%1:07:01:: , the variety---variety%1:14:01:: of experience---experience%1:09:01:: they offered .
`` How ya gonna keep ' em down on the farm---farm%1:06:00:: '' ?
was a question---question%1:10:00:: that had to be asked long before they saw Paree .
Though Americans---american%1:18:00:: usually lived in groups---group%1:03:00:: segregated by national origin---origin%1:07:00:: or religious belief---religious_belief%1:09:00:: , they liked to work and shop in the noise---noise%1:11:00:: and vitality---vitality%1:07:01:: of downtown---downtown%1:15:00:: .
Only a radical change---change%1:24:00:: in the nature---nature%1:07:02:: of the population---population%1:14:00:: in the central city---central_city%1:15:00:: would be likely to destroy this preference---preference%1:12:00:: - and we must now turn our attention---attention%1:09:00:: to the question---question%1:10:01:: of whether such a change---change%1:24:00:: , gloomily foreseen by so many urban diagnosticians---diagnostician%1:18:00:: , is actually upon us .
In their book---book%1:10:00:: American Skyline , Christopher Tunnard---person%1:03:00:: and Henry Hope Reed---person%1:03:00:: argue that Franklin Roosevelt---person%1:03:00:: 's New Deal---new_deal%1:10:00:: was what made the modern suburb---suburb%1:15:00:: a possibility---possibility%1:26:00:: - a fine ironical argument---argument%1:10:02:: , when you consider how suburbanites---suburbanite%1:18:00:: tend to vote .
The first superhighways---superhighway%1:06:00:: - New York---new_york%1:15:01:: 's Henry Hudson---location%1:03:00:: and Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: 's Lake Shore---location%1:03:00:: , San Francisco---san_francisco%1:15:00:: 's Bay Bridge---location%1:03:00:: and its approaches---approach%1:06:00:: , a good slice---slice%1:21:00:: of the Pennsylvania Turnpike---location%1:03:00:: - were built as part---part%1:24:00:: of the federal works program---works_program%1:09:00:: which was going to cure the depression---depression%1:26:02:: .
At the same time , Roosevelt---person%1:03:00:: 's Federal Housing Administration---federal_housing_administration%1:14:00:: , coupled with Henry Morgenthau---person%1:03:00:: 's cheap-money---cheap_money%1:21:00:: policy---policy%1:09:00:: , permitted ordinary lower-middle-class families---family%1:14:02:: to build their own homes---home%1:06:00:: .
Bankers---banker%1:18:00:: who had been reluctant to lend without better security---security%1:21:01:: than the house---house%1:06:00:: itself got that security---security%1:21:01:: from the U. S.---u.s.%1:14:00:: government---government%1:14:00:: ; householders---householder%1:18:00:: who had been unable to pick up the burden---burden%1:09:01:: of short-term high interest---interest%1:21:00:: mortgages---mortgage%1:21:00:: found they could borrow for twenty-five years---year%1:28:01:: at 4 per cent---percent%1:24:00:: , under government---government%1:14:00:: aegis---aegis%1:04:00:: .
Polyphosphates---polyphosphate%1:27:00:: gave renewed life---life%1:28:00:: to soap---soap%1:06:00:: products---product%1:06:01:: at a time---time%1:28:00:: when surfactants---surfactant%1:27:00:: were a threat---threat%1:26:00:: though expensive , and these same polyphosphates---polyphosphate%1:27:00:: spelled the decline---decline%1:22:02:: of soap---soap%1:06:00:: usage---usage%1:04:00:: when the synergism---synergism%1:22:00:: between polyphosphates---polyphosphate%1:27:00:: and synthetic detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: actives---active%1:27:00:: was recognized and exploited .
The market---market%1:14:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: for detergent builders---detergent_builder%1:27:00:: is quite diverse .
The best known field---field%1:26:00:: of application---application%1:04:02:: for builders---builder%1:27:00:: is in heavy-duty , spray-dried detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: formulations---formulation%1:27:00:: for household---household%1:14:00:: use---use%1:04:00:: .
These widely advertised products---product%1:06:01:: , which are used primarily for washing clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: , are based on high-sudsing , synthetic organic actives---active%1:27:00:: ( sodium---sodium%1:27:00:: alkylbenzenesulfonates---alkylbenzenesulfonate%1:27:00:: ) and contain up to 50 % by weight---weight%1:07:00:: of sodium tripolyphosphate---sodium_tripolyphosphate%1:27:00:: or a mixture---mixture%1:27:00:: of sodium tripolyphosphate---sodium_tripolyphosphate%1:27:00:: and tetrasodium pyrophosphate---tetrasodium_pyrophosphate%1:27:00:: .
In the household---household%1:14:00:: market---market%1:14:00:: , there are also low-sudsing detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: formulations---formulation%1:27:00:: based on nonionic actives---active%1:27:00:: with about the same amount---amount%1:03:00:: of phosphate---phosphate%1:27:00:: builder---builder%1:27:00:: ; light-duty synthetic detergents---detergent%1:27:00:: with much less builder---builder%1:27:00:: ; and the dwindling built soap powders---soap_powder%1:06:00:: as well as soap flakes---soap_flakes%1:06:00:: and granules---granule%1:17:00:: , none of which are now nationally advertised .
A well publicized entrant---entrant%1:06:00:: which has achieved success---success%1:04:00:: only recently is the built liquid detergent---liquid_detergent%1:06:00:: , with which the major problem---problem%1:26:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: is incorporation---incorporation%1:04:01:: of builder---builder%1:27:00:: and active---active%1:27:00:: into a small volume---volume%1:23:00:: using a sufficiently high builder---builder%1:27:00:: / active---active%1:27:00:: ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: .
Hard surface---surface%1:06:00:: cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: in household---household%1:14:00:: application---application%1:04:02:: is represented by two classes---class%1:14:00:: of alkaline products---product%1:06:01:: : ( 1 ) the formulations---formulation%1:27:00:: made expressly for machine---machine%1:06:00:: dishwashers---dishwasher%1:06:00:: , and ( 2 ) the general-purpose cleaners---cleaner%1:06:00:: used for walls---wall%1:06:00:: and woodwork---woodwork%1:06:00:: .
The better quality---quality%1:09:00:: products---product%1:06:01:: in both of these lines---line%1:06:08:: contain phosphate---phosphate%1:27:00:: builders---builder%1:27:00:: .
In addition , many of the hard surface---surface%1:06:00:: cleaners---cleaner%1:06:00:: used for walls---wall%1:06:00:: and woodwork---woodwork%1:06:00:: had their genesis---genesis%1:11:00:: in trisodium orthophosphate---trisodium_orthophosphate%1:27:00:: , which is still the major ingredient---ingredient%1:06:00:: of a number---number%1:07:00:: of such products---product%1:06:01:: .
Many scouring---scouring%1:04:00:: powders---powder%1:27:00:: now also contain phosphates---phosphate%1:27:00:: .
These hard surface---surface%1:06:00:: cleaners---cleaner%1:06:00:: are discussed in Chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: 28 .
Cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: or detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: action---action%1:22:00:: is entirely a matter---matter%1:09:00:: of surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: .
Wet cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: involves an aqueous medium---medium%1:15:01:: , a solid substrate---substrate%1:27:00:: , soil---soil%1:26:00:: to be removed , and the detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: or surface-active material---material%1:27:00:: .
An oversimplified differentiation---differentiation%1:09:00:: between soft - and hard surface---surface%1:06:00:: cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: lies in the magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: and kind---kind%1:09:00:: of surface---surface%1:06:00:: involved .
One gram---gram%1:23:00:: of cotton---cotton%1:27:01:: has been found to have a specific surface area---surface_area%1:07:00:: of * * f .
In contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: , a metal---metal%1:27:00:: coupon---coupon%1:09:00:: * * f in size---size%1:07:00:: would have a magnitude---magnitude%1:07:00:: from 100000---100000%1:23:00:: to a million less .
Even here there is room---room%1:26:00:: for some variation---variation%1:11:01:: , for metal---metal%1:27:00:: surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: vary in smoothness---smoothness%1:07:00:: , absorptive capacity---capacity%1:26:00:: , and chemical reactivity---reactivity%1:26:00:: .
Spring---person%1:03:00:: used a Brush---person%1:03:00:: surface---surface%1:06:00:: analyzer---analyzer%1:06:00:: in a metal---metal%1:27:00:: cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: study---study%1:04:00:: and showed considerable differences---difference%1:07:00:: in soil---soil%1:26:00:: removal---removal%1:04:00:: , depending upon surface---surface%1:06:00:: roughness---roughness%1:07:00:: .
There are considerable differences---difference%1:07:00:: between the requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: for textile---textile%1:06:00:: and hard surface---surface%1:06:00:: cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: .
Exclusive of esthetic values---value%1:07:00:: , such as high - or low foam---foam%1:17:00:: level---level%1:07:00:: , perfume---perfume%1:06:00:: content---content%1:23:00:: , etc. , the requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: for the organic active---active%1:27:00:: used in washing---washing%1:04:00:: textiles---textile%1:06:00:: are high .
No matter how they are formulated , a large number---large_number%1:23:00:: of organic actives---active%1:27:00:: are simply not suitable for this application---application%1:04:02:: , since they do not give adequate soil---soil%1:26:00:: removal---removal%1:04:00:: .
This is best demonstrated by practical washing---washing%1:04:00:: tests---test%1:09:02:: in which cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: articles---article%1:03:00:: are repeatedly washed with the same detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: formulation---formulation%1:27:00:: .
A good formulation---formulation%1:27:00:: will keep the clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: clean and white after many washings---washing%1:04:00:: ; whereas , with a poor formulation---formulation%1:27:00:: , the clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: exhibit a build-up---buildup%1:04:00:: of `` tattle-tale grey---tattletale_grey%1:07:00:: '' and dirty spots---spot%1:07:00:: - sometimes with bad results---result%1:19:00:: even after the first wash---wash%1:04:01:: .
Since practical washing procedures are both lengthy and expensive , a number of laboratory tests have been developed for the numerical evaluation of detergents---detergent%1:06:00:: .
Since practical washing---washing%1:04:00:: procedures---procedure%1:04:02:: are both lengthy and expensive , a number---number%1:07:00:: of laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: tests---test%1:09:02:: have been developed for the numerical evaluation---evaluation%1:09:00:: of detergents---detergent%1:27:00:: .
Harris has indicated that two devices , the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent---detergent%1:06:00:: testing , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics .
Harris---person%1:03:00:: has indicated that two---two%1:23:00:: devices---device%1:06:00:: , the Launder-Ometer and Terg-O-Tometer are most widely used for rapid detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: testing---testing%1:04:03:: , and he has listed the commercially available standard soiled fabrics---fabric%1:06:00:: .
Also given are several laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: wash---wash%1:04:01:: procedures---procedure%1:04:02:: in general use---use%1:04:00:: .
The soiled fabrics---fabric%1:06:00:: used for rapid testing---testing%1:04:03:: of detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: formulations---formulation%1:27:00:: are made in such a way---way%1:07:01:: that only part---part%1:17:00:: of the soil---soil%1:26:00:: is removed by even the best detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: formulation---formulation%1:27:00:: in a single wash---wash%1:04:01:: .
In this way---way%1:07:01:: , numerical values---value%1:09:00:: for the relative efficacy---efficacy%1:07:00:: of various detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: formulations---formulation%1:27:00:: can be obtained by measuring the reflectance---reflectance%1:23:00:: ( whiteness---whiteness%1:07:00:: ) of the cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: swatches---swatch%1:06:00:: before and after washing---washing%1:04:00:: .
Soil---soil%1:26:00:: redeposition---redeposition%1:22:00:: is evaluated by washing clean swatches---swatch%1:06:00:: with the dirty ones .
As is the case---case%1:26:00:: with the surface-active agent---surface-active_agent%1:27:00:: , the requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: for builders---builder%1:27:00:: to be used in detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: compositions---composition%1:27:00:: for washing---washing%1:04:00:: textiles---textile%1:06:00:: are also high .
Large numbers---large_number%1:23:00:: of potential builders---builder%1:27:00:: have been investigated , but none have been found to be as effective as the polyphosphates---polyphosphate%1:27:00:: over the relatively wide range---range%1:07:00:: of conditions---condition%1:26:00:: met in practice .
The problems---problem%1:26:00:: of hard surface---surface%1:06:00:: cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: are not nearly as complex .
In hard surface---surface%1:06:00:: cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: , the inorganic salts---salt%1:27:00:: are more important than the organic active---active%1:27:00:: .
Indeed , when the proper inorganic constituents---constituent%1:06:00:: are employed , practically any wetting---wetting%1:04:00:: or surface-active agent---surface-active_agent%1:27:00:: will do a reasonably good job---job%1:04:01:: when present in sufficient amount---amount%1:03:00:: in a hard surface---surface%1:06:00:: cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: formulation---formulation%1:27:00:: .
Hydroxides---hydroxide%1:27:00:: , orthophosphates---orthophosphate%1:27:00:: , borates---borate%1:27:00:: , carbonates---carbonate%1:27:00:: , and silicates---silicate%1:27:00:: are important inorganic ingredients---ingredient%1:06:00:: of hard surface---surface%1:06:00:: cleaners---cleaner%1:06:00:: .
In addition , the polyphosphates---polyphosphate%1:27:00:: are also used , probably acting more as peptizing agents---agent%1:27:00:: than anything else .
The importance---importance%1:07:00:: of the inorganic constituents---constituent%1:06:00:: in hard surface---surface%1:06:00:: cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: has been emphasized in a number---number%1:07:00:: of papers---papers%1:10:00:: .
Although there is no question---question%1:07:00:: but that the process---process%1:04:00:: of washing---washing%1:04:00:: fabrics---fabric%1:06:00:: involves a number---number%1:07:00:: of phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: which are related together in an extremely complicated way---way%1:26:00:: and that these phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: and their interrelations---interrelation%1:24:00:: are not well understood at the present---present%1:28:00:: , this section---section%1:10:00:: attempts to present briefly an up-to-date picture---picture%1:09:00:: of the physical chemistry---physical_chemistry%1:09:00:: of washing---washing%1:04:00:: either fabrics---fabric%1:06:00:: or hard surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: .
The purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of washing---washing%1:04:00:: is , obviously , to remove soils---soil%1:26:00:: which are arbitrarily classed in the four major categories---category%1:14:00:: given below :
Dirt---dirt%1:26:00:: , which is here defined as particulate material---material%1:27:00:: which is usually inorganic and is very often extremely finely divided so as to exhibit colloidal properties---property%1:07:00:: .
Greasy soils---soil%1:26:00:: , which are typified by hydrocarbons---hydrocarbon%1:27:00:: and fats---fat%1:27:00:: ( esters---ester%1:27:00:: of glycerol---glycerol%1:27:00:: with long chain---chain%1:17:00:: organic acids---acid%1:27:00:: ) .
Stains---stain%1:07:00:: , which include the wide variety---variety%1:14:01:: of nonparticulate materials---material%1:27:00:: which give color---color%1:07:00:: even when present in very low concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: on the soiled object---object%1:03:00:: .
Miscellaneous soils---soil%1:26:00:: , which primarily include sticky substances---substance%1:03:00:: and colorless liquids---liquid%1:27:04:: which evaporate to leave a residue---residue%1:27:00:: .
The dirt---dirt%1:26:00:: on the soiled objects---object%1:03:00:: is mechanically held by surface---surface%1:06:00:: irregularities---irregularity%1:07:04:: to some extent---extent%1:26:00:: .
However , a major factor---factor%1:11:00:: in binding dirt---dirt%1:26:00:: is the attraction---attraction%1:19:00:: between surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: that goes under the name of van der Waal 's forces---van_der_waal's_forces%1:19:00:: .
This is a theoretically complicated dipole---dipole%1:17:00:: interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: which causes any extremely small uncharged particle---particle%1:27:01:: to agglomerate with other small uncharged particles---particle%1:27:01:: , or to stick to an uncharged surface---surface%1:06:00:: .
Obviously , if colloidal particles---particle%1:27:01:: bear charges---charge%1:19:00:: of opposite sign---sign%1:24:00:: or , if one kind---kind%1:09:00:: is charged and the other kind---kind%1:09:00:: is not , the attraction---attraction%1:19:00:: will be intensified and the tendency---tendency%1:07:00:: to agglomerate will be greatly reinforced .
Likewise , a charged particle---particle%1:27:01:: will tend to stick to an uncharged surface---surface%1:06:00:: and vice versa , and a charged particle---particle%1:27:01:: will be very strongly attracted to a surface---surface%1:06:00:: exhibiting an opposite charge---charge%1:19:00:: .
In addition , dirt---dirt%1:26:00:: particles---particle%1:27:01:: can be held onto a soiled surface---surface%1:06:00:: by sticky substances---substance%1:03:00:: or by the surface tension---surface_tension%1:19:00:: of liquids---liquid%1:27:04:: , including liquid greases---grease%1:27:00:: .
Greases---grease%1:27:00:: , stains---stain%1:07:00:: , and miscellaneous soils---soil%1:26:00:: are usually sorbed onto the soiled surface---surface%1:06:00:: .
In most cases---case%1:11:00:: , these soils---soil%1:26:00:: are taken up as liquids---liquid%1:27:04:: through capillary action---capillary_action%1:19:00:: .
In an essentially static system---system%1:27:00:: , an oil---oil%1:27:00:: cannot be replaced by water---water%1:27:00:: on a surface---surface%1:06:00:: unless the interfacial tensions---interfacial_tension%1:19:00:: of the water---water%1:27:00:: phase---phase%1:26:00:: are reduced by a surface-active agent---surface-active_agent%1:27:00:: .
The washing---washing%1:04:00:: process---process%1:04:00:: whereby soils---soil%1:26:00:: are removed consists basically of applying mechanical action---action%1:22:00:: to loosen the dirt---dirt%1:26:00:: particles---particle%1:27:01:: and dried matter---matter%1:03:00:: in the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: which helps to float off the debris---debris%1:27:00:: and acts , to some extent---extent%1:26:00:: , as a dissolving---dissolving_agent%1:27:00:: and solvating---solvating_agent%1:27:00:: agent .
Greasy soils---soil%1:26:00:: are hardly removed by washing---washing%1:04:00:: in plain water---water%1:27:00:: ; and natural waters---water%1:27:00:: , in addition , often contain impurities---impurity%1:27:00:: such as calcium---calcium%1:27:00:: salts---salt%1:27:00:: which can react with soils---soil%1:26:00:: to make them more difficult to remove .
Therefore , detergents---detergent%1:27:00:: are used .
The detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: active---active%1:27:00:: is that substance---substance%1:03:00:: which primarily acts to remove greasy soils---soil%1:26:00:: .
The other constituents---constituent%1:06:00:: in a built detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: assist in this and in the removal---removal%1:04:00:: of dirty stains---stain%1:07:00:: and the hydrophilic sticky or dried soils---soil%1:26:00:: .
As is well known , detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: actives---active%1:27:00:: belong to the chemical class---class%1:14:00:: consisting of moderately high molecular weight---molecular_weight%1:07:00:: and highly polar molecules---molecule%1:27:00:: which exhibit the property---property%1:07:00:: of forming micelles---micelle%1:17:00:: in solution---solution%1:27:00:: .
Physicochemical investigations---investigation%1:09:00:: of anionic surfactants---surfactant%1:27:00:: , including the soaps---soap%1:06:00:: , have shown that there is little polymerization---polymerization%1:22:00:: or agglomeration---agglomeration%1:14:00:: of the chain---chain%1:17:00:: anions---anion%1:17:00:: below a certain region---region%1:15:00:: of concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: called the critical micelle---micelle%1:17:00:: concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: .
( 1 ) Below the critical micelle---micelle%1:17:00:: concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: , monomers---monomer%1:27:00:: and some dimers---dimer%1:27:00:: are present .
( 2 ) In the critical micelle---micelle%1:17:00:: region---region%1:15:00:: , there is a rapid agglomeration---agglomeration%1:14:00:: or polymerization---polymerization%1:22:00:: to give the micelles---micelle%1:17:00:: , which have a degree---degree%1:07:00:: of polymerization---polymerization%1:22:00:: averaging around 60 - 80 .
( 3 ) For anionics---anionic%1:27:00:: , these micelles---micelle%1:17:00:: appear to be roughly spherical assemblages---assemblage%1:06:00:: in which the hydrocarbon---hydrocarbon%1:27:00:: tails---tail%1:25:00:: come together so that the polar groups---group%1:27:00:: ( the ionized ends---end%1:15:02:: ) face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase---phase%1:26:00:: .
Obviously hydrophobic ( oleophilic ) substances---substance%1:03:00:: such as greases---grease%1:27:00:: , oils---oil%1:27:00:: , or particles---particle%1:27:01:: having a greasy or oily surface---surface%1:06:00:: are more at home in the center---center%1:15:01:: of a micelle---micelle%1:17:00:: than in the aqueous phase---phase%1:26:00:: .
Micelles---micelle%1:17:00:: can imbibe and hold a considerable amount---amount%1:03:00:: of oleophilic substances---substance%1:03:00:: so that the micelle---micelle%1:17:00:: volume---volume%1:23:00:: may be increased as much as approximately two-fold .
Although the matter---matter%1:09:00:: has not been unequivocally demonstrated , the available data---data%1:14:00:: show that micelles---micelle%1:17:00:: in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency---detergency%1:07:00:: process---process%1:04:00:: .
Related to micelle---micelle%1:17:00:: formation---formation%1:04:01:: is the technologically important ability---ability%1:07:00:: of detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: actives---active%1:27:00:: to congregate at oil water interfaces---oil-water_interface%1:17:00:: in such a manner---manner%1:07:02:: that the polar ( or ionized ) end---end%1:15:02:: of the molecule---molecule%1:27:00:: is directed towards the aqueous phase---phase%1:26:00:: and the hydrocarbon---hydrocarbon%1:27:00:: chain---chain%1:17:00:: towards the oily phase---phase%1:26:00:: .
In the cleaning---cleaning%1:04:00:: process---process%1:04:00:: , sorbed greasy soils---soil%1:26:00:: become coated in this manner---manner%1:07:02:: with an oriented film---film%1:06:00:: of surfactant---surfactant%1:27:00:: .
Then during washing---washing%1:04:00:: , the greasy soil---soil%1:26:00:: rolls back at the edges---edge%1:15:00:: so that emulsified droplets---droplet%1:23:00:: can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil---oil%1:27:00:: mass---mass%1:07:00:: , with the aid---aid%1:04:00:: of mechanical action---action%1:22:00:: , and enter the aqueous phase---phase%1:26:00:: .
Obviously , a substance---substance%1:03:00:: which is permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface---surface%1:06:00:: in place of the soil---soil%1:26:00:: will tend to accelerate this process---process%1:04:00:: and effectively push off the greasy soil---soil%1:26:00:: .
Substances---substance%1:03:00:: other than detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: actives---active%1:27:00:: also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media---medium%1:15:01:: onto surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: of other contiguous condensed phases---phase%1:26:00:: .
This is particularly true of highly charged ions---ion%1:17:00:: , especially those ions---ion%1:17:00:: which fall into the class---class%1:14:00:: of polyelectrolytes---polyelectrolyte%1:27:00:: .
Whereas the usual organic surface-active agent---surface-active_agent%1:27:00:: is strongly sorbed at oil-water interfaces---oil-water_interface%1:17:00:: , the highly charged ions---ion%1:17:00:: are most strongly sorbed at interfaces---interface%1:06:00:: between water---water%1:27:00:: and insoluble materials---material%1:27:00:: exhibiting an ionic structure---structure%1:07:00:: ( see Table---table%1:14:00:: 26 - 2 on p.---page%1:10:00:: 1678 ) .
Thus , for aqueous media---medium%1:15:01:: , we can think of the idealized organic active---active%1:27:00:: as an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent---surface-active_agent%1:27:00:: , and of an idealized builder---builder%1:27:00:: as a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent---surface-active_agent%1:27:00:: .
From the equilibrium---equilibrium%1:22:00:: sorption---sorption%1:22:00:: data---data%1:14:00:: which are available , it seems logical to expect that polyphosphate---polyphosphate%1:27:00:: ions---ion%1:17:00:: would be strongly sorbed on the surface---surface%1:06:00:: of the dirt---dirt%1:26:00:: ( especially clay---clay%1:27:00:: soils---soil%1:26:00:: ) so as to give it a greatly increased negative charge---negative_charge%1:19:00:: .
The charged particles---particle%1:27:01:: then repel each other and are also repelled from the charged surface---surface%1:06:00:: , which almost invariably bears a negative charge---negative_charge%1:19:00:: under washing---washing%1:04:00:: conditions---condition%1:26:00:: .
The negatively charged dirt---dirt%1:26:00:: particles---particle%1:27:01:: then leave the surface---surface%1:06:00:: and go into the aqueous phase---phase%1:26:00:: .
This hypothesis---hypothesis%1:09:00:: is evolved in analogy---analogy%1:04:00:: to the demonstrated action---action%1:22:00:: of organic actives---active%1:27:00:: in detergency---detergency%1:07:00:: .
It does not consider the kinetic effects---effect%1:19:00:: of the phosphate---phosphate%1:27:00:: builders---builder%1:27:00:: on sorption---sorption%1:22:00:: desorption---desorption%1:22:00:: phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: which will be discussed later ( see pp.---page%1:10:00:: 1746 - 1748 ) .
The crude picture---picture%1:09:00:: of the detergency---detergency%1:07:00:: process---process%1:04:00:: thus far developed can be represented as : * * f The influence---influence%1:19:00:: of mechanical action---action%1:22:00:: on the particles---particle%1:27:01:: of free soil---soil%1:26:00:: may be compared to that of kinetic energy---kinetic_energy%1:19:00:: on a molecular scale---scale%1:24:00:: .
Freed soil---soil%1:26:00:: must be dispersed and protected against flocculation---flocculation%1:22:00:: .
Cleaned cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: must be protected against the redeposition---redeposition%1:22:00:: of dispersed soil---soil%1:26:00:: .
It is evident that the requirements---requirement%1:09:01:: imposed by these effects---effect%1:19:00:: upon any one detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: constituent---constituent%1:06:00:: acting alone are severe .
Upon consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: of the variety---variety%1:14:01:: of soils---soil%1:26:00:: and fabrics---fabric%1:06:00:: normally encountered in the washing---washing%1:04:00:: process---process%1:04:00:: , it is little wonder---wonder%1:09:00:: that the use---use%1:04:00:: of a number---number%1:07:00:: of detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: constituents---constituent%1:06:00:: having `` synergistic '' properties---property%1:07:00:: has gained widespread acceptance---acceptance%1:04:00:: .
In the over-all process---process%1:04:00:: , it is difficult to assign a `` pure '' role---role%1:07:00:: to each constituent---constituent%1:06:00:: of a built detergent---detergent%1:27:00:: formulation---formulation%1:27:00:: ; and , indeed , there is no more reason---reason%1:16:00:: to separate the interrelated roles---role%1:07:00:: of the active---active%1:27:00:: , builder---builder%1:27:00:: , antiredeposition---antiredeposition%1:22:00:: agent---agent%1:27:00:: , etc. than there is to assign individual actions---action%1:22:00:: to each of the numerous isomers---isomer%1:27:00:: making up a given commercial organic active---active%1:27:00:: .
During the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the summer---summer%1:28:00:: my scholarly mania---mania%1:16:00:: for making plaster casts---plaster_cast%1:06:00:: and spatter---spatter%1:04:00:: prints---print%1:06:00:: of Catskill---location%1:03:00:: flowers---flower%1:20:00:: and leaves---leaf%1:20:00:: was all but surpassed by the constantly renewed impressions---impression%1:09:00:: of Jessica---person%1:03:00:: that my mind---mind%1:09:00:: served up to me for contemplation---contemplation%1:09:00:: and delight---delight%1:12:00:: .
Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: in all the preceding years---year%1:28:01:: had had the power---power%1:07:00:: to bring me closer to a knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of profound sorrow---sorrow%1:12:00:: than the breakup---breakup%1:04:00:: of camp---camp%1:14:00:: , the packing---packing%1:04:00:: away of my camp---camp%1:14:00:: uniforms---uniform%1:06:00:: , the severing---severing%1:04:00:: of ties---tie%1:06:04:: with the six or ten people---people%1:14:00:: I had grown most to love in the world---world%1:17:01:: .
In final separation---separation%1:26:00:: from them , in the railroad terminal---railroad_terminal%1:06:00:: across the river---river%1:17:00:: from New York---new_york%1:15:01:: , I would nearly cry .
My parents---parent%1:18:00:: ' welcoming arms---arm%1:08:00:: would seem woeful , inadequate , unwanted .
But that year---year%1:28:01:: was different , for just as the city---city%1:15:00:: , in the form---form%1:07:00:: of my street---street%1:06:00:: clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: , had intruded upon my mountain---mountain%1:17:00:: nights---night%1:28:00:: , so an essential part---part%1:24:00:: of the summer---summer%1:28:00:: gave promise---promise%1:09:00:: of continuing into the fall---fall%1:28:00:: : Jessica---person%1:03:00:: and I , about to be separated not by a mere footbridge---footbridge%1:06:00:: or mess-hall---mess_hall%1:06:00:: kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: but by the immense obstacle---obstacle%1:06:00:: of residing in cruelly distant boroughs---borough%1:15:00:: , had agreed to correspond .
These letters---letter%1:10:00:: became the center---center%1:09:00:: of my existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
I lived to see an envelope---envelope%1:06:01:: of hers in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: mail---mail%1:10:01:: and to lock myself in my room---room%1:06:00:: in the afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: to reread her letter---letter%1:10:00:: for the tenth time---time%1:11:00:: and finally prepare an answer---answer%1:10:00:: .
My memory---memory%1:09:00:: has catalogued for easy reference---reference%1:04:00:: and withdrawal---withdrawal%1:10:00:: the image---image%1:09:00:: of her pink , scented stationery---stationery%1:10:00:: and the unsloped , almost printed configurations---configuration%1:07:00:: of her neat , studious handwriting---handwriting%1:10:00:: with which she invited me to recall our summer---summer%1:28:00:: , so many sentences---sentence%1:10:00:: beginning with `` Remember when '' ; and others concerning camp---camp%1:14:00:: friends---friend%1:18:00:: who resided in her suburban neighborhood---neighborhood%1:14:00:: , and news---news%1:10:01:: of her commencing again her piano lessons---piano_lesson%1:04:00:: , her private school---private_school%1:14:00:: , a visit---visit%1:04:02:: to Boston---boston%1:15:00:: to see her grandparents---grandparent%1:18:00:: and an uncle---uncle%1:18:00:: who was a surgeon---surgeon%1:18:00:: returned on furlough---furlough%1:28:00:: , wounded , from the war---war%1:04:00:: in Europe---europe%1:17:00:: .
In my letters---letter%1:10:00:: I took on a personality---personality%1:07:00:: that differed from the self---self%1:09:00:: I knew in real life---real_life%1:09:00:: .
Then epistolatory me was a foreign correspondent---correspondent%1:18:00:: dispatching exciting cables---cable%1:10:00:: and communiques---communique%1:10:00:: , full of dash---dash%1:07:00:: and wit---wit%1:10:00:: and glamor---glamor%1:07:00:: , quoting from the books---book%1:10:00:: I read , imitating the grand styles---style%1:07:00:: of the authors---author%1:18:00:: recommended by a teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: in whose special , after school class---class%1:14:03:: I was enrolled .
The letters---letter%1:10:00:: took their source---source%1:15:00:: from a stream---stream%1:04:00:: of my imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: in which I was transformed into a young man---young_man%1:18:00:: not unlike my bunkmate---bunkmate%1:18:00:: Eliot Sands---person%1:03:00:: - he of the porch---porch%1:06:00:: steps---steps%1:06:00:: anecdotes---anecdote%1:10:00:: - who smoked cigarettes---cigarette%1:06:00:: , performed the tango---tango%1:04:00:: , wore fifty dollar---dollar%1:23:00:: suits---suit%1:06:00:: , and sneaked off into the dark---dark%1:28:00:: with girls---girl%1:18:02:: to do unimaginable things---thing%1:04:00:: with them .
Like Eliot---person%1:03:00:: , in my fantasies---fantasy%1:09:00:: , I had a proud bearing---bearing%1:07:00:: and , with a skill---skill%1:09:00:: that was vaguely continental , I would lead Jessica---person%1:03:00:: through an evening---evening%1:28:00:: of dancing---dancing%1:04:00:: and handsome descriptions---description%1:10:01:: of my newest exploits---exploit%1:04:00:: , would guide her gently to the night---night%1:28:00:: 's climax---climax%1:11:00:: which , in my dreams---dream%1:09:03:: , was always represented by our almost suffocating one another to death---death%1:11:00:: with deep , moist kisses---kiss%1:04:00:: burning with love---love%1:12:00:: .
The night---night%1:28:00:: after reading her letter---letter%1:10:00:: about her surgeon---surgeon%1:18:00:: uncle---uncle%1:18:00:: - it must have been late in September---september%1:28:00:: - I had a vision---vision%1:09:03:: of myself returned in ragged uniform---uniform%1:06:00:: from The Front---front%1:15:01:: , nearly dying , my head---head%1:08:00:: bandaged and bloody , and Jessica---person%1:03:00:: bending over me , the power---power%1:07:00:: of her love---love%1:12:00:: bringing me back to life---life%1:26:00:: .
For many nights---night%1:28:00:: afterward , the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of her having been so close to me in that imagined bed---bed%1:06:00:: would return and fill me with obscure and painful desires---desire%1:12:00:: , would cause me to lie awake in shame---shame%1:12:00:: , tossing with irresolution---irresolution%1:09:00:: , longing to fall into a deep sleep .
The weeks---week%1:28:00:: went by , and the longer our separation---separation%1:26:00:: grew , the more unbounded and almost unbearable my fantasies---fantasy%1:09:00:: became .
They caused my love---love%1:12:00:: for Jessica---person%1:03:00:: to become warmer and at the same time more hopeless , as if my adolescent self---self%1:09:00:: knew that only torment---torment%1:12:01:: would ever bring me the courage---courage%1:07:00:: to ask to see her again .
As it turned out , Jessica---person%1:03:00:: took matters---matter%1:09:01:: into her own hands---hands%1:04:00:: .
Having received permission---permission%1:10:00:: to give a camp---camp%1:14:00:: reunion---reunion%1:14:00:: Halloween---halloween%1:28:00:: party---party%1:14:00:: , she asked that I come and be her date---date%1:18:00:: .
I went and , mum and nervous , all but made a fool---fool%1:18:02:: of myself .
Again among those jubilantly reunited bunkmates---bunkmate%1:18:00:: , I was shy with Jessie---person%1:03:00:: and acted as I had during those early Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: mornings---morning%1:28:00:: when we all seemed to be playing for effect , to be detached and unconcerned with the girls---girl%1:18:02:: who were properly our dates---date%1:18:00:: but about whom , later , in the privacy---privacy%1:07:00:: of our bunks---bunk%1:06:00:: , we would think in terms of the most elaborate romance---romance%1:26:00:: .
I remember standing in a corner---corner%1:15:01:: , watching Jessica---person%1:03:00:: act the hostess---hostess%1:18:00:: , serving soft drinks---soft_drink%1:13:00:: to her guests---guest%1:18:00:: .
She was wearing her dark hair---hair%1:08:00:: in two , thick braids---braid%1:08:00:: to attain an `` American Girl '' effect---effect%1:07:00:: she thought was appropriate to Halloween .
Yet a moment---moment%1:28:01:: did come that night---night%1:28:00:: when the adventurous letter writer---letter_writer%1:18:00:: and fantasist---fantasist%1:18:00:: seemed to stride off my flashy pages---page%1:10:00:: , out of my mind---mind%1:09:00:: , and plant himself in reality---reality%1:26:01:: .
It was late , we were playing kissing---kissing%1:04:00:: games---game%1:04:01:: , and Jessica---person%1:03:00:: and I called on to kiss in front of the others .
We blushed and were flustered , and it turned out to be the fleetest brush---brush%1:11:00:: of lips---lip%1:08:00:: upon cheek---cheek%1:08:00:: .
The kiss---kiss%1:04:00:: outraged our friends---friend%1:18:00:: but it was done and meanwhile had released in me all the remote , exciting premonitions---premonition%1:12:00:: of lust---lust%1:12:00:: , all the mysterious sensations---sensation%1:12:00:: that I had imagined a truly consummated kiss---kiss%1:04:00:: would convey to me .
It was at that party---party%1:14:00:: that , finally overcoming my timidity---timidity%1:12:00:: , inspired by tales---tale%1:10:00:: only half understood and overheard among older boys---boy%1:18:00:: , I asked Jessie---person%1:03:00:: to spend New Year's Eve---new_year's_eve%1:28:00:: with me .
Lovingly , she accepted , and so great was my emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: that all I could think of saying was , `` You 're amazing , you know '' ?
Later , we agreed to think of how we wished to spend that night---night%1:28:00:: .
We would write to one another and make a definite plan---plan%1:09:00:: .
Among my school---school%1:14:00:: and neighborhood---neighborhood%1:14:00:: friends---friend%1:18:00:: , during the next months---month%1:28:01:: , I bragged and swaggered and pompously described my impending date---date%1:14:00:: .
But though I boasted and gave off a dapper front---front%1:09:00:: , I was beneath it all frightened .
It would be the first time---time%1:11:00:: I had ever been completely alone with a girl---girl%1:18:00:: I loved .
I had no idea---idea%1:09:00:: of what subjects---subject%1:10:00:: one discussed when alone with a girl---girl%1:18:00:: , or how one behaved :
Should I hold her hand---hand%1:08:00:: while walking or only when crossing the street---street%1:06:00:: ?
Should I bring along a corsage---corsage%1:06:00:: or send one to her ?
Was it preferable to meet her at home or in the city---city%1:15:00:: ?
Should I accompany her to the door---door%1:06:01:: of her home---home%1:06:00:: , or should I ask to be invited in ?
In or out , should I kiss her good-night---good_night%1:10:00:: ?
All this was unknown to me , and yet I had dared to ask her out for the most important night---night%1:28:00:: of the year---year%1:28:01:: !
When in one letter---letter%1:10:00:: Jessica---person%1:03:00:: informed me that her father---father%1:18:00:: did not like the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of her going out alone on New Year's Eve---new_year's_eve%1:28:00:: , I knew for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: an immense relief---relief%1:12:00:: ; but the letter---letter%1:10:00:: went on : she had cried , she had implored , she had been miserable at his refusal---refusal%1:10:00:: , and finally he had relented - and now how happy she was , how expectant !
Her optimism---optimism%1:12:00:: gave me heart---heart%1:07:01:: .
I forced confidence---confidence%1:09:00:: into myself .
I made inquiries---inquiry%1:10:01:: , I read a book---book%1:10:00:: of etiquette---etiquette%1:10:00:: .
In December---december%1:28:00:: I wrote her with authority that we would meet on the steps---steps%1:06:00:: of the Hotel Astor---location%1:03:00:: , a rendezvous---rendezvous%1:04:00:: spot---spot%1:15:01:: that I had learned was the most sophisticated .
We would attend a film---film%1:10:01:: and , later on , I stated , we might go to the Mayflower Coffee Shop---location%1:03:00:: or Child---location%1:03:00:: 's or Toffenetti---location%1:03:00:: 's for waffles---waffle%1:13:00:: .
I set the hour---hour%1:28:01:: of our meeting---meeting%1:14:01:: for seven .
At five o'clock that night---night%1:28:00:: it was already dark---dark%1:28:00:: , and behind my closed door---door%1:06:00:: I was dressing as carefully as a groom---groom%1:18:02:: .
I wore a new double-breasted brown worsted---worsted%1:06:00:: suit---suit%1:06:00:: with a faint herringbone---herringbone%1:06:00:: design---design%1:06:00:: and wide lapels---lapel%1:06:00:: like a devil---devil%1:18:00:: 's ears---ear%1:08:01:: .
My camp---camp%1:14:00:: made leather---leather%1:27:00:: wallet---wallet%1:06:00:: , bulky with twisted , raised stitches---stitch%1:06:00:: around the edges---edge%1:15:00:: , I stuffed with money---money%1:21:00:: I had been saving .
Hatless , in an overcoat---overcoat%1:06:00:: of rough blue wool---wool%1:06:00:: , I was given a proud farewell---farewell%1:10:00:: by my mother---mother%1:18:00:: and father---father%1:18:00:: , and I set out into the strangely still streets---street%1:06:00:: of Brooklyn---brooklyn%1:15:00:: .
I felt superior to the neighborhood friends I was leaving behind , felt older than my years , and was full of compliments for myself as I headed into the subway that was carrying its packs of passengers out of that dull borough and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement---excitement%1:04:00:: of Manhattan .
I felt superior to the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:14:00:: friends---friend%1:18:00:: I was leaving behind , felt older than my years---years%1:28:00:: , and was full of compliments---compliment%1:10:00:: for myself as I headed into the subway---subway%1:06:00:: that was carrying its packs---pack%1:23:00:: of passengers---passenger%1:18:00:: out of that dull borough---borough%1:15:00:: and into the unstable , tantalizing excitement---excitement%1:04:02:: of Manhattan---manhattan%1:15:00:: .
Times Square---location%1:03:00:: , when I ascended to it with my fellow subway---subway%1:06:00:: travellers---traveller%1:18:00:: ( all dressed as if for a huge wedding---wedding%1:11:00:: in a family---family%1:14:01:: of which we were all distant members---member%1:18:00:: ) , was nearly impassable , the sidewalks---sidewalk%1:06:00:: swarming with celebrants---celebrant%1:18:01:: , with bundled up sailors---sailor%1:18:01:: and soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: already hugging their girls---girl%1:18:01:: and their rationed bottles---bottle%1:06:00:: of whiskey---whiskey%1:13:00:: .
Heavy coated , severe looking policemen---policeman%1:18:00:: sat astride noble horses---horse%1:05:00:: along the curbside---curbside%1:06:00:: to prevent the revellers---reveller%1:18:00:: from spilling out in front of the crawling traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: .
The night---night%1:28:00:: was cold but the crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: kept one warm .
The giant electric signs---sign%1:06:01:: and marquees---marquee%1:06:01:: were lit up for the first time since blackout---blackout%1:26:00:: regulations---regulation%1:10:00:: had been instituted , and the atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: was alive with the feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: that victory---victory%1:11:00:: was just around the corner .
Cardboard---cardboard%1:27:00:: noisemakers---noisemaker%1:06:00:: , substitutes for the unavailable tin---tin%1:27:00:: models---model%1:09:03:: , were being hawked and bought at makeshift stands---stand%1:06:04:: every few yards---yard%1:23:00:: along Broadway---location%1:03:00:: , and one 's ears---ear%1:09:00:: were continually serenaded by the horns---horn%1:06:06:: ' rasps---rasp%1:10:00:: and bleats---bleat%1:11:00:: .
An old gentlemen---gentleman%1:18:00:: next to me held a Boy Scout---boy_scout%1:18:00:: bugle---bugle%1:06:00:: to his lips---lip%1:08:00:: and blasted away at every fourth step---step%1:04:00:: and during the interim---interim%1:28:00:: shouted out , `` V for Victory---victory%1:11:00:: '' !
His neighbors---neighbor%1:18:00:: cheered him on .
There was a great sense---sense%1:09:05:: of camaraderie---camaraderie%1:07:00:: .
Was I supposed to buy a funny hat---hat%1:06:00:: and a rattle---rattle%1:11:00:: for Jessica---person%1:03:00:: ?
It was a quarter of seven---seven%1:23:00:: when the crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: washed me up among the other gallants---gallant%1:18:01:: who had established the Astor---location%1:03:00:: steps---steps%1:06:00:: as the beach-head---beachhead%1:15:00:: from which to launch their night---night%1:28:00:: of merrymaking---merrymaking%1:04:00:: .
I looked over their faces---face%1:08:00:: and felt a twinge---twinge%1:12:00:: : they all looked so much more knowing than I .
I looked for Jessica---person%1:03:00:: to materialize out of the clogging , curdling crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: and , as the time---time%1:03:00:: passed and I waited , a fiend---fiend%1:18:00:: came to life beside me and whispered in my ear---ear%1:08:01:: : How was I planning to greet Jessica---person%1:03:00:: ?
Where exactly would we go after the movie---movie%1:10:00:: ?
Suppose the lines---line%1:14:01:: in front of the movie houses---movie_house%1:06:00:: were too long and we could n't get in ?
Suppose I had n't brought along enough money---money%1:21:00:: ?
I felt for my wallet---wallet%1:06:00:: .
Its thick , substantial outline---outline%1:15:00:: calmed me .
Suppose her father---father%1:18:00:: had changed his mind---mind%1:09:04:: and had refused to let her leave ?
Suppose at this very moment---moment%1:28:00:: her father---father%1:18:00:: was calling my house---house%1:06:00:: in an effort---effort%1:04:00:: to cancel the plans---plan%1:09:00:: ?
All about me there was a hectic interplay---interplay%1:04:00:: of meetings---meeting%1:14:01:: taking place , like abrupt , jerky scenes---scene%1:10:00:: in old silent movies---silent_movie%1:10:00:: , joyous greetings---greeting%1:10:00:: and beginnings---beginning%1:11:00:: , huggings---hugging%1:04:00:: and kissings---kissing%1:04:00:: , enthusiastic forays into the festive night---night%1:28:00:: .
Whole platoons---platoon%1:14:00:: were taking up new positions---position%1:15:00:: on the steps---steps%1:06:00:: , arriving and departing , while I stayed glued , like a signpost---signpost%1:10:00:: , to one spot---spot%1:15:01:: .
At 7 : 25 two hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: doormen---doorman%1:18:00:: came thumping down the steps---steps%1:06:00:: , carrying a saw-horse---sawhorse%1:06:00:: to be set up as a barricade---barricade%1:06:00:: in front of the haberdashery store---haberdashery_store%1:06:00:: window---window%1:06:00:: next to the entranceway---entranceway%1:06:00:: , and as I watched them in their gaudy red coats that nearly scraped the ground---ground%1:27:00:: , their golden , fringed epaulets---epaulet%1:06:00:: and spic , red visored caps---cap%1:06:00:: , I suddenly saw just over their shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: Jessica---person%1:03:00:: gracefully making her way through the crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: .
My heart---heart%1:08:00:: almost stopped beating .
Now that he knew himself to be self---self%1:09:00:: he was free to grok ever closer to his brothers---brother%1:18:02:: , merge without let .
Self---self%1:09:00:: 's integrity---integrity%1:26:00:: was and is and ever had been .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: stopped to cherish all his brother selves---self%1:18:00:: , the many threes-fulfilled on Mars---mars%1:17:00:: , corporate and discorporate , the precious few on Earth---earth%1:17:00:: - the unknown powers---power%1:10:00:: of three on Earth---earth%1:17:00:: that would be his to merge with and cherish now that at last long waiting he grokked and cherished himself .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: remained in trance---trance%1:26:00:: ; there was much to grok , loose ends---loose_end%1:04:00:: to puzzle over and fit into his growing---growing%1:22:00:: - all that he had seen and heard and been at the Archangel Foster Tabernacle---location%1:03:00:: ( not just cusp when he and Digby---person%1:03:00:: had come face to face alone ) - why Bishop Senator Boone---person%1:03:00:: made him warily uneasy , how Miss Dawn Ardent---person%1:03:00:: tasted like a water brother when she was not , the smell---smell%1:07:00:: of goodness---goodness%1:07:02:: he had incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down---jumping_up_and_down%1:04:00:: and wailing -
Jubal---person%1:03:00:: 's conversations---conversation%1:10:00:: coming and going - Jubal---person%1:03:00:: 's words---word%1:10:00:: troubled him most ; he studied them , compared them with what he had been taught as a nestling---nestling%1:05:00:: , struggling to bridge between languages---language%1:10:00:: , the one he thought with and the one he was learning to think in .
The word---word%1:10:00:: `` church '' which turned up over and over again among Jubal---person%1:03:00:: 's words---word%1:10:00:: gave him knotty difficulty---difficulty%1:09:02:: ; there was no Martian concept---concept%1:09:00:: to match it - unless one took `` church---church%1:14:00:: '' and `` worship---worship%1:04:00:: '' and `` God '' and `` congregation '' and many other words---word%1:10:00:: and equated them to the totality---totality%1:26:00:: of the only world---world%1:09:00:: he had known during growing waiting & & & then forced the concept---concept%1:09:00:: back into English---english%1:10:00:: in that phrase---phrase%1:10:00:: which had been rejected ( by each differently ) by Jubal---person%1:03:00:: , by Mahmoud---person%1:03:00:: , by Digby---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Thou art God---god%1:18:01:: '' .
He was closer to understanding it in English---english%1:10:00:: now , although it could never have the inevitability---inevitability%1:07:00:: of the Martian concept---concept%1:09:00:: it stood for .
In his mind---mind%1:09:00:: he spoke simultaneously the English---english%1:10:00:: sentence---sentence%1:10:00:: and the Martian word---word%1:10:00:: and felt closer grokking .
Repeating it like a student---student%1:18:00:: telling himself that the jewel---jewel%1:06:00:: is in the lotus---lotus%1:20:02:: he sank into nirvana---nirvana%1:26:00:: .
Before midnight---midnight%1:28:00:: he speeded his heart---heart%1:08:00:: , resumed normal breathing---breathing%1:04:00:: , ran down his check list---checklist%1:10:00:: , uncurled and sat up .
He had been weary ; now he felt light and gay and clear-headed , ready for the many actions---action%1:04:02:: he saw spreading out before him .
He felt a puppyish need---need%1:03:00:: for company---company%1:26:00:: as strong as his earlier necessity---necessity%1:26:00:: for quiet---quiet%1:26:00:: .
He stepped out into the hall---hall%1:06:03:: , was delighted to encounter a water brother .
`` Hi---hi%1:10:00:: '' !
Hello , Mike---person%1:03:00:: .
Ben---person%1:03:00:: and Stinky---person%1:03:00:: went home an hour---hour%1:28:00:: ago and people---people%1:14:00:: started going to bed '' .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: felt disappointed that Mahmoud---person%1:03:00:: had left ; he wanted to explain his new grokking .
`` I ought to be asleep , too , but I felt like a snack---snack%1:13:00:: .
`` Come on , there 's some cold chicken---chicken%1:13:00:: and we 'll see what else '' .
They went downstairs , loaded a tray---tray%1:06:00:: lavishly .
`` A fine idea---idea%1:09:00:: '' , Mike---person%1:03:00:: agreed .
`` Warm enough to swim - real Indian summer---indian_summer%1:28:00:: .
I 'll switch on the floods---flood%1:06:00:: '' .
`` Do n't bother '' , Mike---person%1:03:00:: answered .
`` I 'll carry the tray---tray%1:06:00:: '' .
He could see in almost total darkness---total_darkness%1:26:00:: .
Jubal---person%1:03:00:: said that his night-sight---night-sight%1:09:00:: probably came from the conditions---condition%1:26:00:: in which he had grown up , and Mike---person%1:03:00:: grokked this was true but grokked that there was more to it ; his foster parents---foster_parent%1:18:00:: had taught him to see .
As for the night---night%1:28:00:: being warm , he would have been comfortable naked on Mount Everest---mount_everest%1:17:00:: but his water brothers had little tolerance---tolerance%1:07:03:: for changes---change%1:24:00:: in temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: and pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: ; he was considerate of their weakness---weakness%1:07:01:: , once he learned of it .
But he was looking forward to snow---snow%1:19:00:: - seeing for himself that each tiny crystal---crystal%1:27:00:: of the water---water%1:27:00:: of life---life%1:19:00:: was a unique individual---individual%1:18:00:: , as he had read - walking barefoot , rolling in it .
In the meantime he was pleased with the warm night---night%1:28:00:: and the still more pleasing company---company%1:26:00:: of his water brother .
`` Okay , take the tray---tray%1:06:00:: .
I 'll switch on the underwater lights---light%1:06:00:: .
That 'll be plenty---plenty%1:07:00:: to eat by '' .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: liked having light---light%1:19:00:: up through the ripples---ripple%1:11:00:: ; it was a goodness---goodness%1:07:02:: , beauty---beauty%1:07:00:: .
They picnicked by the pool---pool%1:06:00:: , then lay back on the grass---grass%1:20:00:: and looked at stars---star%1:17:00:: .
`` Mike---person%1:03:00:: , there 's Mars---mars%1:17:00:: .
It is Mars---mars%1:17:00:: , is n't it ?
Or Antares---antares%1:17:00:: '' ?
`` It is Mars---mars%1:17:00:: '' .
`` Mike---person%1:03:00:: ?
What are they doing on Mars---mars%1:17:00:: '' ?
He hesitated ; the question---question%1:10:00:: was too wide for the sparse English language---english_language%1:10:00:: .
`` On the side---side%1:15:02:: toward the horizon---horizon%1:15:00:: - the southern hemisphere---southern_hemisphere%1:15:00:: - it is spring---spring%1:28:00:: ; plants---plant%1:03:00:: are being taught to grow '' .
`` Larry---person%1:03:00:: teaches plants---plant%1:03:00:: to grow .
But my people---people%1:14:00:: - Martians---martian%1:18:00:: , I mean ; I now grok you are my people---people%1:14:00:: - teach plants---plant%1:03:00:: another way---way%1:07:01:: .
In the other hemisphere---hemisphere%1:15:00:: it is growing colder and nymphs---nymph%1:05:00:: , those who stayed alive through the summer---summer%1:28:00:: , are being brought into nests---nest%1:17:00:: for quickening---quickening%1:22:00:: and more growing---growing%1:22:00:: '' .
`` Of the humans we left at the equator---equator%1:15:00:: , one has discorporated and the others are sad '' .
Yes , I heard it in the news---news%1:10:02:: `` .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: had not heard it ; he had not known it until asked .
Mr. Booker T. W. Jones Food Technician---person%1:03:00:: First Class---first_class%1:07:00:: is not sad ; the Old Ones---person%1:03:00:: have cherished him '' .
`` Yes---yes%1:10:00:: .
He had his own face---face%1:07:00:: , dark and beautiful .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: & & & do you ever get homesick ?
For Mars---mars%1:17:00:: '' ?
He rolled toward her and took her in his arms---arm%1:08:00:: .
`` Mike---mike%1:06:00:: darling '' - They kissed , and went on kissing .
That was almost worse than the first time---time%1:11:00:: '' .
`` You are all right , my brother---brother%1:18:02:: '' ?
`` Yes---yes%1:10:00:: .
Yes---yes%1:10:00:: indeed .
A long time---long_time%1:28:00:: later , by cosmic clock---clock%1:06:00:: , she said , `` Mike---person%1:03:00:: ?
`` Well & & & I 've been ready a long time---long_time%1:28:00:: - goodness , we all have , but & & & never mind , dear ; turn just a little .
As they merged , grokking together , Mike---person%1:03:00:: said softly and triumphantly : `` Thou art God---god%1:18:01:: '' .
Her answer---answer%1:10:00:: was not in words---word%1:10:00:: .
Then , as their grokking made them ever closer and Mike---person%1:03:00:: felt himself almost ready to discorporate her voice---voice%1:07:00:: called him back : `` Oh !
Thou art God---god%1:18:01:: '' !
`` We grok God---god%1:18:01:: '' .
On Mars---mars%1:17:00:: humans---human%1:05:00:: were building pressure domes---pressure_dome%1:06:00:: for the male and female party---party%1:14:02:: that would arrive by next ship---ship%1:06:00:: .
This went faster than scheduled as the Martians---martian%1:18:00:: were helpful .
Part---part%1:24:00:: of the time---time%1:28:05:: saved was spent on a preliminary estimate---estimate%1:10:00:: for a long-distance plan---plan%1:09:00:: to free bound oxygen---oxygen%1:27:00:: in the sands---sand%1:27:00:: of Mars---mars%1:17:00:: to make the planet---planet%1:17:00:: more friendly to future human generations---generation%1:14:00:: .
The Old Ones neither helped nor hindered this plan---plan%1:09:00:: ; time---time%1:28:06:: was not yet .
Their meditations---meditation%1:09:00:: were approaching a violent cusp---cusp%1:06:00:: that would shape Martian art---art%1:04:00:: for many millennia---millennium%1:28:00:: .
On Earth---earth%1:17:00:: elections---election%1:04:01:: continued and a very advanced poet---poet%1:18:00:: published a limited edition---limited_edition%1:10:00:: of verse---verse%1:10:00:: consisting entirely of punctuation marks---punctuation_mark%1:10:00:: and spaces---space%1:10:00:: ; Time magazine---group%1:03:00:: reviewed it and suggested that the Federation Assembly Daily Record---group%1:03:00:: should be translated into the medium---medium%1:10:01:: .
A colossal campaign---campaign%1:04:02:: opened to sell more sexual organs---organ%1:08:00:: of plants---plant%1:03:00:: and Mrs. Joseph Shadow of Greatness Douglas---person%1:03:00:: was quoted as saying : `` I would no more sit down without flowers---flower%1:20:00:: on my table---table%1:06:01:: than without serviettes---serviette%1:06:00:: '' .
A Tibetan swami---swami%1:18:00:: from Palermo---palermo%1:15:00:: , Sicily---sicily%1:15:00:: , announced in Beverly Hills---location%1:03:00:: a newly discovered , ancient yoga---yoga%1:09:00:: discipline---discipline%1:04:00:: for ripple---ripple%1:11:00:: breathing---breathing%1:04:00:: which increased both pranha and cosmic attraction---attraction%1:19:00:: between sexes---sex%1:14:00:: .
His chelas---chela%1:18:00:: were required to assume the matsyendra---matsyendra%1:07:00:: posture---posture%1:07:00:: dressed in hand-woven diapers---diaper%1:06:00:: while he read aloud from Rig-Veda---rig-veda%1:10:00:: and an assistant guru---guru%1:18:00:: examined their purses---purse%1:06:00:: in another room---room%1:06:00:: - nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: was stolen ; the purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: was less immediate .
The President of the United States---president_of_the_united_states%1:18:00:: proclaimed the first Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: in November---november%1:28:00:: as `` National Grandmothers ' Day '' and urged America---america%1:15:00:: to say it with flowers---flower%1:20:00:: .
A funeral parlor---funeral_parlor%1:06:00:: chain---chain%1:14:02:: was indicted for price-cutting---price_cutting%1:04:00:: .
Fosterite bishops---bishop%1:18:00:: , after secret conclave---conclave%1:14:00:: , announced the Church---church%1:14:00:: 's second Major Miracle : Supreme Bishop Digby---person%1:03:00:: had been translated bodily to Heaven and spot-promoted to Archangel---archangel%1:18:00:: , ranking with-but-after Archangel Foster---person%1:03:00:: .
The glorious news---news%1:10:01:: had been held up pending Heavenly confirmation---confirmation%1:09:00:: of the elevation---elevation%1:11:00:: of a new Supreme Bishop---person%1:03:00:: , Huey Short---person%1:03:00:: - a candidate---candidate%1:18:01:: accepted by the Boone faction---faction%1:14:01:: after lots---lot%1:06:00:: had been cast repeatedly .
L'Unita---group%1:03:00:: and Hoy---location%1:03:00:: published identical denunciations---denunciation%1:10:00:: of Short---person%1:03:00:: 's elevation---elevation%1:11:00:: , l'Osservatore Romano---group%1:03:00:: and the Christian Science Monitor---group%1:03:00:: ignored it , Times of India---group%1:03:00:: snickered at it , and the Manchester Guardian---group%1:03:00:: simply reported it - the Fosterites in England---england%1:15:00:: were few but extremely militant .
Digby---person%1:03:00:: was not pleased with his promotion---promotion%1:04:00:: .
The Man from Mars---person%1:03:00:: had interrupted him with his work---work%1:06:00:: half finished - and that stupid jackass---jackass%1:18:00:: Short---person%1:03:00:: was certain to louse it up .
Foster---person%1:03:00:: listened with angelic patience---patience%1:07:00:: until Digby---person%1:03:00:: ran down , then said , `` Listen , junior---junior%1:18:02:: , you 're an angel---angel%1:18:00:: now - so forget it .
Eternity---eternity%1:26:00:: is no time---time%1:11:00:: for recriminations---recrimination%1:10:00:: .
You too were a stupid jackass---jackass%1:18:00:: until you poisoned me .
Now that Short---person%1:03:00:: is Supreme Bishop---person%1:03:00:: he 'll do all right , he can n't help it .
Same as with the Popes---pope%1:18:00:: .
Check with one of them , go ahead - there 's no professional jealousy---jealousy%1:12:00:: here '' .
Digby---person%1:03:00:: calmed down , but made one request---request%1:10:00:: .
Foster---person%1:03:00:: shook his halo---halo%1:07:00:: .
Oh , you can submit a requisition---requisition%1:10:00:: for a miracle---miracle%1:11:01:: if you want to make a fool---fool%1:18:00:: of yourself .
But , I'm telling you , it 'll be turned down - you do n't understand the System---system%1:14:00:: yet .
The Martians---martian%1:18:00:: have their own setup---setup%1:06:00:: , different from ours , and as long as they need him , we can n't touch him .
They run their show their way---way%1:07:01:: - the Universe---universe%1:17:00:: has variety---variety%1:07:00:: , something for everybody - a fact---fact%1:09:01:: you field---field%1:15:01:: workers---worker%1:18:00:: often miss '' .
`` You mean this punk---punk%1:18:00:: can brush me aside and I 've got to hold still for it '' ?
`` I held still for the same thing---thing%1:11:00:: , did n't I ?
Now look , there 's work---work%1:04:00:: to be done and lots---lots%1:23:00:: of it .
The Boss---boss%1:18:01:: wants performance---performance%1:04:00:: , not gripes---gripe%1:10:00:: .
If you need a Day off---day_off%1:28:00:: to calm down , duck over to the Muslim Paradise and take it .
Otherwise , straighten your halo---halo%1:07:00:: , square your wings---wing%1:05:00:: , and dig in .
The sooner you act like an angel---angel%1:18:00:: the quicker you 'll feel angelic .
Get Happy , junior---junior%1:18:02:: '' !
Digby---person%1:03:00:: heaved a deep ethereal sigh---sigh%1:10:00:: .
Jubal---person%1:03:00:: did not hear of Digby---person%1:03:00:: 's disappearance---disappearance%1:04:00:: when it was announced , and , when he did , while he had a fleeting suspicion---suspicion%1:09:01:: , he dismissed it ; if Mike---person%1:03:00:: had had a finger in it , he had gotten away with it - and what happened to supreme bishops---bishop%1:18:00:: worried Jubal---person%1:03:00:: not at all as long as he was n't bothered .
His household---household%1:14:00:: had gone through an upset---upset%1:26:00:: .
Jubal---person%1:03:00:: deduced what had happened but did not know with whom - and did n't want to inquire .
Mike---person%1:03:00:: was of legal age---legal_age%1:28:00:: and presumed able to defend himself in the clinches---clinch%1:04:00:: .
Anyhow , it was high time---high_time%1:28:00:: the boy---boy%1:18:00:: was salted .
Jubal---person%1:03:00:: could n't reconstruct the crime---crime%1:04:00:: from the way---way%1:07:01:: the girls---girl%1:18:00:: behaved because patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: kept shifting - ABC vs D , then BCD vs A & & & or AB vs CD , or AD vs CB , through all ways---way%1:07:01:: that four women---woman%1:18:00:: can gang up on each other .
This continued most of the week---week%1:28:00:: following that ill-starred trip---trip%1:04:00:: to church---church%1:04:00:: , during which period---period%1:28:00:: Mike---person%1:03:00:: stayed in his room---room%1:06:00:: and usually in a trance---trance%1:26:00:: so deep that Jubal---person%1:03:00:: would have pronounced him dead had he not seen it before .
Jubal---person%1:03:00:: would not have minded it if service---service%1:04:01:: had not gone to pieces .
The girls---girl%1:18:00:: seemed to spend half---half%1:23:00:: their time---time%1:28:05:: tiptoeing in `` to see if Mike---person%1:03:00:: was all right '' and they were too preoccupied to cook , much less be secretaries---secretary%1:18:00:: .
Even rock-steady Anne---person%1:03:00:: - Hell , Anne---person%1:03:00:: was the worst !
Absent-minded , subject to unexplained tears---tears%1:04:00:: .
Jubal---person%1:03:00:: would have bet his life---life%1:26:00:: that if Anne---person%1:03:00:: were to witness the Second Coming---second_coming%1:11:00:: , she would memorize date---date%1:28:00:: , time---time%1:28:03:: , personae---persona%1:09:00:: , events---event%1:03:00:: , and barometric pressure---barometric_pressure%1:19:00:: without batting her calm blue eyes---eye%1:08:00:: .
Franklin D. Lee---person%1:03:00:: proved a man---man%1:18:00:: of prompt action---action%1:07:00:: when Mrs. Claire Shaefer---person%1:03:00:: , accompanied by a friend---friend%1:18:00:: , visited him in Bakersfield---location%1:03:00:: , California---california%1:15:00:: , several months---month%1:28:01:: ago as a prospective patient---patient%1:18:00:: .
`` Doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: '' Lee---person%1:03:00:: asked her to lie down on a bed---bed%1:06:00:: and remove her shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: .
Then , by squeezing her foot---foot%1:08:01:: three times---time%1:11:00:: , he came up - presto - with a different diagnosis---diagnosis%1:04:00:: with each squeeze---squeeze%1:04:00:: .
She had - he informed her - kidney---kidney%1:08:00:: trouble , liver---liver%1:08:00:: trouble , and a severe female disorder---disorder%1:26:03:: .
( He explained that he could diagnose these ailments---ailment%1:26:00:: from squeezing her foot---foot%1:08:01:: because all of the nervous system---nervous_system%1:08:00:: was connected to it . )
He knew just the thing---thing%1:04:00:: for her - a treatment---treatment%1:04:00:: from his `` cosmic light---light%1:19:00:: ozone---ozone%1:27:00:: generator---generator%1:06:00:: '' machine---machine%1:06:00:: .
As he applied the applicator---applicator%1:06:00:: extending from the machine---machine%1:06:00:: - which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes---neon_tube%1:06:00:: superimposed on a rectangular base---base%1:06:01:: - to the supposedly diseased portions---portion%1:24:00:: of Mrs. Shaefer---person%1:03:00:: 's body---body%1:08:00:: , Lee---person%1:03:00:: kept up a steady stream---stream%1:11:00:: of pseudo scientific mumbo-jumbo---mumbo_jumbo%1:10:00:: .
Yes , the ozone---ozone%1:27:00:: from his machine---machine%1:06:00:: would cure practically everything , he assured her .
Did she know , he asked , why the colors---color%1:07:00:: of the tubes---tube%1:06:00:: were important to people---people%1:14:00:: 's health---health%1:26:00:: ?
The human body---human_body%1:08:00:: - he pointed out , for example - required 33 units---unit%1:23:00:: of blue light---light%1:19:00:: .
For that reason---reason%1:16:00:: , he informed her , the Lord---lord%1:18:02:: made the sky---sky%1:17:00:: blue .
Continuing glibly in this vein---vein%1:10:00:: , he paused to comfort her :
This machine---machine%1:06:00:: will cure your cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: ridden body---body%1:08:00:: '' .
`` Cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: '' !
Mrs. Shaefer---person%1:03:00:: practically shrieked .
`` You did n't tell me I had cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: '' .
But as long as you can have treatment---treatment%1:04:00:: from my machine---machine%1:06:00:: you have nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to worry about .
Why , I once used this machine---machine%1:06:00:: to cure a woman---woman%1:18:00:: with 97 pounds---pound%1:23:09:: of cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: in her body---body%1:08:00:: '' .
He urged her to buy one of his machines---machine%1:06:00:: - for $ 300 .
When she said that she did n't have the money---money%1:21:00:: , he said that she could come in for treatment---treatment%1:04:00:: with his office---office%1:06:00:: model---model%1:09:03:: until she was ready to buy one .
He then sold her minerals---mineral%1:27:00:: to cure her kidney---kidney%1:08:00:: ailment---ailment%1:26:00:: , a can---can%1:06:00:: of sage---sage%1:13:00:: `` to make her look like a girl---girl%1:18:02:: again '' , and an application---application%1:04:03:: of plain mud---mud%1:27:00:: to take her wrinkles---wrinkle%1:25:00:: away .
Lee---person%1:03:00:: renewed his pressure---pressure%1:07:00:: on Mrs. Shaefer---person%1:03:00:: to buy his machine---machine%1:06:00:: when she visited him the next day---day%1:28:01:: .
After another treatment---treatment%1:04:00:: with the machine---machine%1:06:00:: , he told her that `` her entire body---body%1:08:00:: was shot through with tumors---tumor%1:26:00:: and cysts---cyst%1:26:00:: '' .
He then sold her some capsules---capsule%1:06:00:: that he asserted would take care of the tumors---tumor%1:26:00:: and cysts---cyst%1:26:00:: until she could collect the money---money%1:21:00:: for buying his machine---machine%1:06:00:: .
When she submitted to his treatment---treatment%1:04:00:: with the capsules---capsule%1:06:00:: , Mrs. Shaefer---person%1:03:00:: felt intense pain---pain%1:26:00:: .
Leaving Lee---person%1:03:00:: 's office---office%1:06:00:: , Mrs. Shaefer---person%1:03:00:: hurried over to her family---family%1:14:02:: physician---physician%1:18:00:: , who treated her for burned tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: .
For several days---day%1:28:00:: , she was ill as a result---result%1:11:00:: of Lee---person%1:03:00:: 's treatment---treatment%1:04:00:: .
Mrs. Shaefer---person%1:03:00:: never got around to joining the thousand or so people---people%1:14:00:: who paid Lee---person%1:03:00:: some $ 30000 for his ozone---ozone%1:27:00:: machines---machine%1:06:00:: .
For Mrs. Shaefer---person%1:03:00:: - who had been given a clean bill of health---bill_of_health%1:10:00:: by her own physician---physician%1:18:00:: at the time---time%1:11:00:: she visited Lee---person%1:03:00:: - and her friend---friend%1:18:00:: were agents---agent%1:18:02:: for the California Pure Food---group%1:03:00:: and Drug Inspection Bureau---group%1:03:00:: .
And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering---suffering%1:12:01:: when the evidence---evidence%1:10:00:: of Lee---person%1:03:00:: 's quack shenanigans---shenanigan%1:04:01:: , gathered by the tape recorder---tape_recorder%1:06:00:: under her friend---friend%1:18:00:: 's clothing---clothing%1:06:00:: , proved adequate in court---court%1:06:02:: for convicting Franklin D. Lee---person%1:03:00:: .
The charge---charge%1:10:00:: : violation---violation%1:04:03:: of the California---california%1:15:00:: Medical Practices---medical_practice%1:04:00:: Act---act%1:10:01:: by practicing medicine---medicine%1:04:00:: without a license---license%1:10:00:: and selling misbranded drugs---drug%1:06:00:: .
The sentence---sentence%1:28:00:: : 360 days---day%1:28:00:: ' confinement---confinement%1:04:00:: in the county---county%1:15:00:: jail---jail%1:06:00:: .
An isolated case---case%1:11:00:: of quackery---quackery%1:04:00:: ?
Rather , it is typical of the thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of quacks---quack%1:18:00:: who use phony therapeutic devices---device%1:06:00:: to fatten themselves on the miseries---misery%1:26:00:: of hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: of Americans---american%1:18:00:: by robbing them of millions of dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: and luring them away from legitimate , ethical medical treatment---treatment%1:04:00:: of serious diseases---disease%1:26:00:: .
The machine---machine%1:06:00:: quack---quack%1:18:00:: makes his Rube Goldberg---person%1:03:00:: devices---device%1:06:00:: out of odds and ends---odds_and_ends%1:14:00:: of metals---metal%1:27:00:: , wires---wire%1:06:00:: , and radio---radio%1:06:01:: parts---part%1:06:00:: .
With these gadgets---gadget%1:06:00:: - impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs---light_bulb%1:06:00:: , ticks---tick%1:11:00:: , and buzzes---buzz%1:11:00:: - he then carries out a vicious medical con game---con_game%1:04:00:: , capitalizing on people---people%1:14:00:: 's respect---respect%1:26:00:: for the electrical and atomic wonders---wonder%1:11:00:: of our scientific age---age%1:28:02:: .
He milks the latest scientific advances---advance%1:11:01:: , translating them into his own special Buck Rogers---person%1:03:00:: vocabulary---vocabulary%1:10:00:: to huckster his fake machines---machine%1:06:00:: as a cure-all---cure-all%1:06:00:: for everything from hay fever---hay_fever%1:26:00:: to sexual impotence---impotence%1:07:00:: and cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: .
The gadget---gadget%1:06:00:: faker---faker%1:18:00:: operates or sells his phony machines---machine%1:06:00:: for $ 5 to $ 10000 - anything the traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: will bear .
He may call himself a naprapath---naprapath%1:18:00:: , a physiotherapist---physical_therapist%1:18:00:: , an electrotherapist---electrotherapist%1:18:00:: , a naturopath---naturopath%1:18:00:: , a sanipractor , a medical cultist---cultist%1:18:00:: , a masseur---masseur%1:18:00:: , a `` doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: '' - or what have you .
Not only do these quacks---quack%1:18:00:: assume impressive titles---title%1:10:02:: , but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations---foundation%1:14:00:: - foundations---foundation%1:14:00:: which often have little more than a letterhead---letterhead%1:10:00:: existence---existence%1:26:00:: .
The medical device---device%1:06:00:: pirate---pirate%1:18:01:: of today---today%1:28:00:: , of course , is a far more sophisticated operator---operator%1:18:02:: than his predecessor---predecessor%1:18:00:: of yesteryear---yesteryear%1:28:00:: - the gallus---gallus%1:06:00:: snapping hawker---hawker%1:18:00:: of snake oil---snake_oil%1:27:00:: and other patent medicines---patent_medicine%1:06:00:: .
His plunder---plunder%1:21:00:: is therefore far higher - running into hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of millions .
According to the Food and Drug Administration---group%1:03:00:: ( FDA---group%1:03:00:: ) , `` Doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: '' Ghadiali---person%1:03:00:: , Dr. Albert Abrams---person%1:03:00:: and his clique---clique%1:14:00:: , and Dr. Wilhelm Reich---person%1:03:00:: - to name three notorious device---device%1:06:00:: quacks---quack%1:18:00:: - succeeded , respectively , in distributing 10000 , 5000 , and 2000 fake health---health%1:26:00:: machines---machine%1:06:00:: .
Authorities---authorities%1:14:00:: believe that many of the Doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: Frauds---fraud%1:18:00:: using these false health---health%1:26:00:: gadgets---gadget%1:06:00:: are still in business---business%1:04:00:: .
Look at the sums---sum%1:21:00:: paid by two device---device%1:06:00:: quack---quack%1:18:00:: victims---victim%1:18:01:: in Cleveland---cleveland%1:15:00:: .
Sarah Gross---person%1:03:00:: , a dress shop---dress_shop%1:06:00:: proprietor---proprietor%1:18:00:: , paid $ 1020 to a masseur---masseur%1:18:00:: , and Mr. A.---person%1:03:00:: , a laborer---laborer%1:18:00:: , paid $ 4200 to a chiropractor---chiropractor%1:18:00:: for treatment---treatment%1:04:00:: with two fake health---health%1:26:00:: machines---machine%1:06:00:: - the `` radioclast '' and the `` diagnometer '' .
Multiply these figures---figure%1:21:00:: by the millions---million%1:23:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: known to be conned by medical pirates---pirate%1:18:01:: annually .
You will come up with a frightening total---total%1:09:00:: .
That 's why the FDA---group%1:03:00:: , the American Medical Association---group%1:03:00:: ( AMA---group%1:03:00:: ) , and the National Better Business Bureau---person%1:03:00:: ( BBB---group%1:03:00:: ) have estimated the toll---toll%1:21:00:: of mechanical quackery---quackery%1:04:00:: to be a substantial portion---portion%1:04:00:: of the $ 610 million---million%1:23:00:: or so paid to medical charlatans---charlatan%1:18:00:: annually .
The Postmaster General---postmaster_general%1:18:00:: recently reported that mail order---mail_order%1:10:00:: frauds---fraud%1:04:00:: - among which fake therapeutic devices---device%1:06:00:: figure prominently - are at the highest level---level%1:07:00:: in history---history%1:28:00:: .
Similarly , the American Cancer Society---group%1:03:00:: ( ACS---group%1:03:00:: ) , the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation---group%1:03:00:: , and the BBB---group%1:03:00:: have each stated lately that medical quackery---quackery%1:04:00:: is at a new high---high%1:07:00:: .
For example , the BBB---group%1:03:00:: has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries---inquiry%1:10:01:: about quack devices---device%1:06:00:: and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years---year%1:28:01:: ago .
Authorities---authorities%1:14:00:: hesitate to quote exact figures---figure%1:21:00:: , however , believing that any sum---sum%1:21:00:: they come up with is only a surface manifestation---manifestation%1:11:00:: - turned up by their inevitably limited policing - of the real loot---loot%1:21:01:: of the medical racketeer---racketeer%1:18:00:: .
In this sense , authorities---authorities%1:14:00:: believe that all estimates---estimate%1:04:01:: of phony device---device%1:06:00:: quackery---quackery%1:04:00:: are conservative .
The economic toll---toll%1:07:01:: that the device---device%1:06:00:: quack---quack%1:18:00:: extracts is important , of course .
But it is our health---health%1:26:00:: - more precious than all the money---money%1:21:00:: in the world---world%1:17:01:: - that these modern witch doctors---witch_doctor%1:18:00:: with their fake therapeutic gadgets---gadget%1:06:00:: are gambling away .
By preying on the sick , by playing callously on the hopes---hope%1:12:00:: of the desperate---desperate%1:18:00:: , by causing the sufferer---sufferer%1:18:00:: to delay proper medical care---medical_care%1:04:00:: , these medical ghouls---ghoul%1:18:01:: create pain---pain%1:12:00:: and misery---misery%1:26:00:: by their very activity---activity%1:04:00:: .
Typically , Sarah Gross---person%1:03:00:: and Mr. A---person%1:03:00:: both lost more than their money---money%1:21:00:: as the result---result%1:19:00:: of their experiences---experience%1:11:00:: with their Cleveland---cleveland%1:15:00:: quacks---quack%1:18:00:: .
Sarah Gross---person%1:03:00:: found that the treatments---treatment%1:04:00:: given her for a nervous ailment---ailment%1:26:00:: by the masseur---masseur%1:18:00:: were not helping her .
As a result---result%1:19:00:: , she consulted medical authorities---authorities%1:14:00:: and learned that the devices---device%1:06:00:: her quack `` doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: '' was using were phony .
She suffered a nervous breakdown---nervous_breakdown%1:26:00:: and had to be institutionalized .
Mr. A.---person%1:03:00:: , her fellow townsman---townsman%1:18:00:: , also experienced a nervous breakdown---nervous_breakdown%1:26:00:: just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life---life%1:28:01:: savings---savings%1:21:00:: by the limited practitioner---practitioner%1:18:00:: who had been treating his wife---wife%1:18:00:: - a woman---woman%1:18:00:: suffering from an incurable disease---disease%1:26:00:: , multiple sclerosis---multiple_sclerosis%1:26:00:: - and himself .
Mr. A---person%1:03:00:: has recovered , but he is , justifiably , a bitter man---man%1:18:00:: .
`` That 's a lot---lot%1:23:00:: of hard earned money---money%1:21:00:: to lose '' , he says today---today%1:28:00:: .
`` Neither me nor my wife---wife%1:18:00:: were helped by that chiropractor---chiropractor%1:18:00:: 's treatments---treatment%1:04:00:: '' .
And there was the case---case%1:26:00:: of Tom Hepker---person%1:03:00:: , a machinist---machinist%1:18:00:: , who was referred by a friend---friend%1:18:00:: to a health---health%1:26:00:: machine---machine%1:06:00:: quack---quack%1:18:00:: who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine---machine%1:06:00:: for what Doctor Fraud---person%1:03:00:: said was a system---system%1:08:01:: full of arsenic---arsenic%1:27:01:: and strychnine---strychnine%1:27:00:: .
After his pains---pain%1:09:00:: got worse , Tom---person%1:03:00:: decided to see a real doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: of the lung---lung%1:08:00:: .
Yes , Tom---person%1:03:00:: caught it in time to stay alive .
But he 's a welfare case---welfare_case%1:18:00:: now - a human wreck---wreck%1:26:00:: - thanks to this modern witch doctor---witch_doctor%1:18:00:: .
But the machine---machine%1:06:02:: quack---quack%1:18:00:: can cause far more than just suffering---suffering%1:12:02:: .
In such diseases---disease%1:26:00:: as cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: , tuberculosis---tuberculosis%1:26:00:: , and heart disease---heart_disease%1:26:00:: , early diagnosis---diagnosis%1:04:00:: and treatment---treatment%1:04:00:: are so vital that the waste of time---waste_of_time%1:04:00:: by the patient---patient%1:18:00:: with Doctor Fraud---person%1:03:00:: 's cure-all---cure-all%1:06:00:: gadget---gadget%1:06:00:: can prove fatal .
Moreover , the diabetic---diabetic%1:18:00:: patient---patient%1:18:00:: who relies on cure---cure%1:06:00:: by the quack device---device%1:06:00:: and therefore cuts off his insulin---insulin%1:08:00:: intake---intake%1:04:00:: can be committing suicide---suicide%1:04:00:: .
In Chicago---location%1:03:00:: , some time---time%1:28:05:: ago , Mr. H.---person%1:03:00:: , age---age%1:07:00:: 27 , a diabetic---diabetic%1:18:00:: since he was six , stopped using insulin---insulin%1:08:00:: because he had bought a `` magic spike---spike%1:06:00:: '' - a glass---glass%1:27:00:: tube---tube%1:06:00:: about the size---size%1:07:00:: of a pencil---pencil%1:06:00:: filled with barium---barium%1:27:00:: chloride---chloride%1:27:00:: worth---worth%1:23:00:: a small fraction---fraction%1:23:00:: of a cent---cent%1:23:00:: - sold by the Vrilium Company---group%1:03:00:: of Chicago---location%1:03:00:: for $ 306 as a cure-all---cure-all%1:06:00:: .
`` Hang this around your neck---neck%1:08:00:: or attach it to other parts---part%1:08:01:: of your anatomy---anatomy%1:08:00:: , and its rays---ray%1:19:00:: will cure any disease---disease%1:26:00:: you have '' , said the company---company%1:14:01:: .
Mr. H.---person%1:03:00:: is dead today---today%1:28:00:: because he followed this advice---advice%1:10:00:: .
Doris Hull---person%1:03:00:: , suffering from tuberculosis---tuberculosis%1:26:00:: , was taken by her husband---husband%1:18:00:: to see Otis G. Carroll---person%1:03:00:: , a sanipractor - a licensed drugless healer---healer%1:18:00:: - in Spokane---location%1:03:00:: .
Carroll---person%1:03:00:: diagnosed Mrs. Hull---person%1:03:00:: by taking a drop---drop%1:23:00:: of blood---blood%1:08:00:: from her ear---ear%1:08:01:: and putting it on his `` radionic '' machine---machine%1:06:00:: and twirling some knobs---knob%1:06:00:: ( fee---fee%1:21:00:: $ 50 ) .
His prescription---prescription%1:10:00:: : hot and cold compresses---compress%1:06:00:: to increase her absorption---absorption%1:22:00:: of water---water%1:27:00:: .
Although she weighed only 108 pounds---pound%1:23:09:: when she visited him , Carroll---person%1:03:00:: permitted her to go on a 10 - day---day%1:28:00:: fast---fast%1:04:00:: in which she took nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but water---water%1:27:00:: .
Inevitably , Mrs. Hull---person%1:03:00:: died of starvation---starvation%1:26:00:: and tuberculosis---tuberculosis%1:26:00:: , weighing 60 pounds---pound%1:23:09:: .
Moreover , her husband---husband%1:18:00:: and child---child%1:18:01:: contracted T.B.---t.b.%1:26:00:: from her .
( Small wonder---wonder%1:11:00:: a Spokane---location%1:03:00:: jury---jury%1:14:01:: awarded the husband---husband%1:18:00:: $ 35823 for his wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's death---death%1:11:00:: . )
In California---location%1:03:00:: , a few years---year%1:28:01:: ago , a ghoul---ghoul%1:18:01:: by the name---name%1:10:00:: of H. F. Bell---person%1:03:00:: sold electric blankets---blanket%1:06:00:: as a cure---cure%1:06:00:: for cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: .
He did this by the charming practice---practice%1:04:03:: of buying up used electric blankets---blanket%1:06:00:: for $ 5 to $ 10 from survivors---survivor%1:18:02:: of patients---patient%1:18:00:: who had died , reconditioning them , and selling them at $ 185 each .
When authorities---authorities%1:14:00:: convicted him of practicing medicine---medicine%1:04:00:: without a license---license%1:10:00:: ( he got off with a suspended sentence---sentence%1:28:00:: of three years---year%1:28:01:: because of his advanced age---age%1:07:00:: of 77 ) , one---one%1:23:00:: of his victims---victim%1:18:01:: was not around to testify : He was dead of cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: .
By no means are these isolated cases---case%1:11:00:: .
`` Unfortunately '' , says Chief Postal Inspector David H. Stephens---person%1:03:00:: , who has prosecuted many device---device%1:06:00:: quacks---quack%1:18:00:: , `` the ghouls---ghoul%1:18:01:: who trade on the hopes---hope%1:12:00:: of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients---patient%1:18:00:: who are the chief witnesses---witness%1:18:01:: die before the case---case%1:04:00:: is called up in court---court%1:14:00:: '' .
Death---death%1:28:00:: !
That 's where device---device%1:06:00:: quackery---quackery%1:04:00:: can lead .
The evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: shows that fake therapeutic machines---machine%1:06:00:: , substituted for valid medical cures , have hastened the deaths---death%1:28:00:: of thousands---thousand%1:23:00:: .
Who are the victims---victim%1:18:01:: of the device---device%1:06:00:: quacks---quack%1:18:00:: ?
Authorities---authorities%1:14:00:: say that oldsters---oldster%1:18:00:: are a prime target---target%1:18:00:: .
Says Wallace F. Jannsen---person%1:03:00:: , director---director%1:18:02:: of the FDA---group%1:03:00:: 's Division of Public Information---group%1:03:00:: : `` Quacks---quack%1:18:00:: are apt to direct their appeal---appeal%1:07:00:: directly to older people---people%1:14:00:: , or to sufferers---sufferer%1:18:00:: from chronic ailments---ailment%1:26:00:: such as arthritis---arthritis%1:26:00:: , rheumatism---rheumatism%1:26:00:: , diabetes---diabetes%1:26:00:: , and cancer---cancer%1:26:00:: .
People---people%1:14:00:: who have not been able to get relief---relief%1:26:00:: from regular medical doctors---doctor%1:18:00:: are especially apt to be taken in by quacks---quack%1:18:00:: '' .
The victims---victim%1:18:01:: of the quacks---quack%1:18:00:: are frequently poor people---people%1:14:00:: , like Mr. A.---person%1:03:00:: , who scrape up their life---life%1:28:01:: savings---savings%1:21:00:: to offer as a sacrifice---sacrifice%1:04:01:: to Doctor Fraud---person%1:03:00:: 's avarice---avarice%1:04:00:: .
But they all said , `` No , your time---time%1:11:00:: will come .
Enjoy being a bride---bride%1:18:00:: while you can '' .
There was no room---room%1:23:00:: for company---company%1:18:00:: in the tiny Weaning House ( where the Albright---person%1:03:00:: boys---boy%1:18:03:: always took their brides---bride%1:18:00:: , till they could get a house---house%1:06:00:: and a farm---farm%1:06:00:: of their own ) .
So when the Big House filled up and ran over , the sisters-in-law---sister-in-law%1:18:00:: found beds---bed%1:06:00:: for everyone in their own homes---home%1:06:00:: .
And there was still not anything that Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: could do .
So Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: gave up asking , and accepted her reprieve---reprieve%1:26:00:: .
Without saying so , she was really grateful ; for to attend the dying was something she had never experienced , and certainly had not imagined when she thought of the duties---duty%1:04:00:: she would have as Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: 's wife---wife%1:18:00:: .
She had made curtains---curtain%1:06:00:: for all the windows---window%1:06:00:: of her little house---house%1:06:00:: , and she had kept it spotless and neat , shabby as it was , and cooked good meals---meal%1:13:00:: for Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: .
She had done all the things---thing%1:04:00:: she had promised herself she would do , but she had not thought of this .
People---people%1:14:00:: died , she would have said , in hospitals---hospital%1:06:00:: , or in cars---car%1:06:00:: on the highway---highway%1:06:00:: at night---night%1:28:00:: .
Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: was gone all day---day%1:28:02:: now , not coming in for dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: and sometimes not for supper---supper%1:13:00:: .
When they first married he had been working in the fields---field%1:15:00:: all day---day%1:28:02:: , and she would get in the car---car%1:06:00:: and drive to wherever he was working , to take him a fresh hot meal---meal%1:13:00:: .
Now---now%1:28:00:: there was no work---work%1:04:01:: in the fields---field%1:15:00:: , nor would there be till it rained , and she did not know where he went .
Not that she complained , or had any cause---cause%1:10:00:: to .
Four---four%1:23:00:: or five---five%1:23:00:: of the cousins---cousin%1:18:00:: from East Texas---location%1:03:00:: were about his age---age%1:07:00:: , so naturally they ran around together .
There was no reason---reason%1:16:00:: for her to ask what they did .
Thus a new pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: of days---day%1:28:02:: began to develop , for Granny Albright---person%1:03:00:: did not die .
She lay still on the bed---bed%1:06:00:: , her head---head%1:08:00:: hardly denting the pillow---pillow%1:06:00:: ; sometimes she opened her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and looked around , and sometimes she took a little milk---milk%1:13:01:: or soup---soup%1:13:00:: .
They stopped expecting her to die the next minute---minute%1:28:00:: , but only in the next day---day%1:28:01:: or two .
Those who had driven hundreds---hundred%1:23:00:: of miles---mile%1:23:01:: for the burial---burial%1:11:00:: would not go home , for she might die any time---time%1:11:00:: ; but they might as well unpack their suitcases---suitcase%1:06:00:: , for she might linger on .
So the pattern---pattern%1:04:00:: was established .
When Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: had put up her breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: dishes---dish%1:06:00:: and mopped her linoleum---linoleum%1:27:00:: rugs---rug%1:06:00:: , she would go to the Big House .
Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: and the boys---boy%1:18:03:: would come by , say `` How 's Granny---granny%1:18:00:: '' ? and sit on the porch---porch%1:06:00:: a while---while%1:28:00:: .
The older men---man%1:18:00:: would be there at noon---noon%1:28:00:: , and maybe rest for a time---time%1:28:05:: before they took their guns---gun%1:06:00:: off to the creek---creek%1:17:00:: or drove down the road---road%1:06:00:: towards town---town%1:15:00:: .
The women---woman%1:18:00:: and children---child%1:18:00:: stayed at the Albrights---person%1:03:00:: ' .
The women---woman%1:18:00:: , keeping their voices---voice%1:10:00:: low as they worked around the house---house%1:06:00:: or sat in the living room---living_room%1:06:00:: , sounded like chickens---chicken%1:13:00:: shut up in a coop---coop%1:06:01:: for the night---night%1:28:00:: .
The children---child%1:18:00:: had to play away from the house---house%1:06:00:: ( in the barn---barn%1:06:00:: loft---loft%1:06:00:: or the pasture---pasture%1:15:00:: behind the barn---barn%1:06:00:: ) , to maintain a proper quietness---quietness%1:12:00:: .
Off and on , all day---day%1:28:02:: , someone---someone%1:03:00:: would be wiping at the powdery gray dust---dust%1:27:00:: that settled over everything .
The evaporative cooler---evaporative_cooler%1:06:00:: had been moved to Granny---granny%1:18:00:: 's room---room%1:06:00:: , and her door---door%1:06:00:: was kept shut ; so that the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the house---house%1:06:00:: stayed open , though there was a question---question%1:10:00:: as to whether it was hotter or cooler that way---way%1:07:01:: .
The dust---dust%1:27:00:: clogged their throats---throat%1:08:00:: , and the heat---heat%1:09:00:: parched them , so that the women---woman%1:18:00:: were always making ice water---ice_water%1:13:00:: .
They had cleaned up an old ice box---icebox%1:06:00:: and begun to buy fifty pound---pound%1:23:09:: blocks---block%1:25:01:: of ice---ice%1:27:00:: in town---town%1:15:00:: , as the electric refrigerator---electric_refrigerator%1:06:00:: came nowhere near providing enough ice---ice%1:27:00:: for the crowds---crowd%1:14:00:: who ate and drank there .
One afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: , as the women---woman%1:18:00:: sat clucking softly , a new carload---carload%1:14:00:: of people---people%1:14:00:: pulled up at the gate---gate%1:06:00:: .
It was a Cadillac , black grayed with the dust---dust%1:27:00:: of the road---road%1:06:00:: , its windows---window%1:06:01:: closed tight so you knew that the people---people%1:14:00:: who climbed out of it would be cool and unwrinkled .
They were an old fat couple---couple%1:14:00:: ( as Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: described them to herself ) , a thick middle-aged man---man%1:18:00:: , and a girl---girl%1:18:02:: about ten or twelve .
There was much embracing---embracing%1:04:00:: , much exclaiming---exclaiming%1:10:00:: .
`` Cousin Ada---person%1:03:00:: !
Cousin John---person%1:03:00:: '' !
`` Cousin Lura---person%1:03:00:: '' !
`` Cousin Howard---person%1:03:00:: '' !
`` About the same , John---person%1:03:00:: , about the same '' .
All the women---woman%1:18:00:: got up and offered their chairs---chair%1:06:00:: , and when they were all seated again , the guests---guest%1:18:00:: made their inquiries---inquiry%1:10:01:: and their explanations---explanation%1:10:00:: .
`` We were on our vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: in Canada---canada%1:15:00:: '' , Howard---person%1:03:00:: explained , in a muffled voice---voice%1:07:00:: that must have been used to booming , `` and the news---news%1:10:00:: did n't catch up with us till we were nearly home .
There was the suggestion---suggestion%1:10:00:: of ice water---ice_water%1:13:00:: , and - in spite of the protest---protest%1:10:00:: `` We 're not really thirsty '' - Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: , to escape the stuffy air---air%1:27:00:: and the smothering soft voices---voice%1:10:00:: , hurried to the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: .
She filled a big pitcher---pitcher%1:23:00:: and set it , with glasses---glass%1:06:00:: , on a tray---tray%1:06:00:: .
Carrying it to the living room---living_room%1:06:00:: , she imagined the picture---picture%1:09:00:: she made : tall and roundly slim , a bit sophisticated in her yellow sheath---sheath%1:06:01:: , with a graceful swingy walk---walk%1:07:00:: that she had learned as a twirler---twirler%1:18:01:: with the school---school%1:14:00:: band---band%1:14:00:: .
Almost immediately she was ashamed of herself for feeling vain , at such a time---time%1:11:00:: , in such a place---place%1:15:00:: , and she tossed back her long yellow hair---hair%1:08:00:: , smiling shyly as she entered the room---room%1:06:00:: .
Howard---person%1:03:00:: ( the thick middle-aged man---man%1:18:00:: ) was looking at her .
She felt the look---look%1:04:00:: and looked back because she could not help it , seeing that he was neither as old nor as thick as she had at first believed .
`` And who is this '' ? he asked , when she passed him a glass---glass%1:06:00:: .
`` Oh that 's Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: '' , Mama Albright---person%1:03:00:: said fondly .
`` She married our baby---baby%1:18:01:: boy---boy%1:18:03:: , Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: , this summer---summer%1:28:00:: '' .
`` Let 's see '' , Cousin Ada---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` He 's a right smart younger than the rest---rest%1:24:00:: '' ?
`` Oh yes '' , Mama---mama%1:18:00:: laughed .
`` He 's ten years---year%1:28:01:: younger than Ernest---person%1:03:00:: .
We did n't expect him to come along ; thought for the longest he was a tumor---tumor%1:26:00:: '' .
This joke---joke%1:10:00:: was not funny to Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: , and she blushed , as she always did ; then , hearing the muffled boom---boom%1:11:01:: of Howard---person%1:03:00:: 's laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: , blushed redder .
`` Who is Howard---person%1:03:00:: , anyway '' ? she asked Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: that night---night%1:28:00:: .
`` Oh he 's a second cousin---second_cousin%1:18:00:: or something .
He got in the oil business---oil_business%1:14:00:: out at Odessa---odessa%1:15:00:: and lucked into some money---money%1:21:02:: '' .
He 's been married and got this half grown kid---kid%1:18:00:: .
If he bothers you , do n't pay him any mind---mind%1:09:03:: .
He 's just a big windbag---windbag%1:18:00:: '' .
Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: was thinking about something else .
`` Say , did you know they 're fixing to have a two day---day%1:28:00:: antelope---antelope%1:05:00:: season---season%1:28:02:: on the Double X '' ?
He was talking about antelope---antelope%1:05:00:: again when they woke up .
`` Listen , I never had a chance---chance%1:26:00:: to kill an antelope---antelope%1:05:00:: .
There never was a season---season%1:28:02:: before , but now they want to thin 'em out on account of the drouth '' .
`` Did he ever visit here when he was a kid---kid%1:18:00:: '' ?
Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: asked .
`` Howard---person%1:03:00:: '' .
When he was a kid---kid%1:18:00:: I was n't around '' .
Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: took a gun---gun%1:06:00:: from behind the door---door%1:06:00:: , and with a quick `` Bye now '' was gone for the day---day%1:28:02:: .
Almost immediately Howard---person%1:03:00:: and his daughter---daughter%1:18:00:: Debora---person%1:03:00:: drove up in the Cadillac .
`` We 're going after ice---ice%1:27:00:: '' , Howard---person%1:03:00:: said , `` and thought maybe you 'd go along and keep us company '' .
There was really no reason---reason%1:16:00:: to refuse , and Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: had never ridden in a Cadillac .
Driving along the caliche-topped road---road%1:06:00:: to town---town%1:15:00:: , Howard---person%1:03:00:: talked .
Finally he said , `` Tell me about yourself '' , and Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: told him , because she thought herself that she had had an interesting life---life%1:10:00:: .
She was such a well-rounded teenager---teenager%1:18:00:: , having been a twirler---twirler%1:18:01:: , Future Farmers sweetheart---sweetheart%1:18:02:: , and secretary---secretary%1:18:00:: of Future Homemakers .
In her sophomore---sophomore%1:18:00:: year---year%1:14:00:: she had started going steady with Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: , who was a football player---football_player%1:18:00:: , Future Homemakers sweetheart---sweetheart%1:18:02:: , and president---president%1:18:03:: of Future Farmers .
Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: would be a senior---senior%1:18:00:: this year---year%1:28:01:: , and he planned to graduate .
But there was no need---need%1:03:00:: for Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: to go on , since all she wanted in life---life%1:09:00:: was to make a home---home%1:06:00:: for Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: and ( blushing ) raise his children---child%1:18:01:: .
Howard---person%1:03:00:: sighed .
`` You lucky kids---kid%1:18:00:: '' , he said .
`` I 'd give anything if I could have found a girl---girl%1:18:00:: like you '' .
Then he told Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: about himself .
Of course he could n't say much---much%1:23:00:: , really , because of Debora---person%1:03:00:: , but Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: could imagine what kind---kind%1:09:00:: of woman---woman%1:18:00:: his wife---wife%1:18:00:: had been and what a raw deal---raw_deal%1:11:00:: he had got .
It made her feel different about Howard---person%1:03:00:: .
She was going to tell Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: about how mistaken she had been , but he brought one of the cousins---cousin%1:18:00:: home for supper---supper%1:13:00:: , and all they did was talk about antelope---antelope%1:05:00:: .
Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: was trying to get Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: to say she would cook one if he brought it home .
`` Cook a whole antelope---antelope%1:05:00:: '' ? she exclaimed .
`` Why , I could n't even cook a piece---piece%1:06:00:: of antelope---antelope%1:05:00:: steak---steak%1:13:00:: ; I never even saw any '' .
I want to roast the whole thing , and have it for the boys---boy%1:18:03:: '' .
Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: told him he could n't do anything like that with his Grandma---grandma%1:18:00:: dying , and he said well they had to eat , did n't they , they were n't all dying .
Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: felt like going off to the bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: to cry ; but they were going up to the Big House after supper---supper%1:13:00:: , and she had to put on a clean dress---dress%1:06:00:: and fix her hair---hair%1:08:00:: a little .
Every night they all went to Mama---mama%1:18:00:: and Papa---papa%1:18:00:: Albright---person%1:03:00:: 's , and sat on the open front porch---front_porch%1:06:00:: , where they could get the breeze---breeze%1:19:00:: .
It was full-of-the-moon---full-of-the-moon%1:28:00:: ( or a little past ) , and nearly light as day---day%1:28:02:: .
They all sat around and drank ice water---ice_water%1:13:00:: , and the men---man%1:18:00:: smoked , and everybody had a good time---time%1:11:01:: .
Once in a while they said what a shame---shame%1:11:00:: it was , with Granny---granny%1:18:00:: dying , but they all agreed she would n't have wanted it any other way---way%1:07:01:: .
That night---night%1:28:00:: the older men---man%1:18:00:: got to talking about going possum---possum%1:05:01:: hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: on a moonlight---moonlight%1:19:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: .
Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: and two---two%1:23:00:: or three---three%1:23:00:: of the other boys---boy%1:18:00:: declared they had never been possum---possum%1:05:01:: hunting---hunting%1:04:01:: , and Uncle Bill Farnworth---person%1:03:00:: ( from Mama Albright---person%1:03:00:: 's side---side%1:14:00:: of the family---family%1:14:01:: ) said he would just get up from there and take them , right then .
After they had left , some of the people---people%1:14:00:: moved around , to find more comfortable places---place%1:15:00:: to sit .
There were not many chairs---chair%1:06:00:: , so that some preferred to sit on the edge---edge%1:25:00:: of the porch---porch%1:06:00:: , resting their feet---foot%1:08:01:: on the ground---ground%1:17:00:: , and others liked to sit where they could lean back against the wall---wall%1:06:00:: .
Howard---person%1:03:00:: , who had been sitting against the wall---wall%1:06:00:: , said he needed more fresh air---air%1:27:00:: , and took the spot---spot%1:15:01:: on the edge---edge%1:25:00:: of the porch---porch%1:06:00:: where Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: had been sitting .
`` You 'll be a darn sight---sight%1:23:00:: more comfortable there , Howard---person%1:03:00:: '' , Ernest---person%1:03:00:: said , laughing , and they all laughed .
Linda Kay---person%1:03:00:: felt that she was not exactly more comfortable .
Bobby Joe---person%1:03:00:: had been sitting close to her , touching her actually , and holding her hand---hand%1:08:00:: from time to time , but it seemed at once that Howard---person%1:03:00:: sat much closer .
Perhaps it was just that he had so much more flesh---flesh%1:08:02:: , so that more of it seemed to come in contact---contact%1:04:02:: with hers ; but she had never been so aware of anyone 's flesh---flesh%1:08:02:: before .
He had become the center---center%1:09:01:: of the company---company%1:14:00:: , such stories---story%1:10:03:: he had to tell .
He had sold oil---oil%1:27:00:: stock---stock%1:21:00:: to Bob Hope---person%1:03:00:: and Bing Crosby---person%1:03:00:: in person ; he had helped fight an oil-well---oil_well%1:06:00:: fire---fire%1:11:00:: that raged six days---day%1:28:02:: and nights---night%1:28:00:: .
But neither was the statement---statement%1:10:00:: empirical , for goodness---goodness%1:07:02:: was not a quality---quality%1:07:00:: like red or squeaky that could be seen or heard .
What were they to do , then , with these awkward judgments---judgment%1:04:02:: of value---value%1:07:00:: ?
To find a place---place%1:09:00:: for them in their theory---theory%1:09:00:: of knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: would require them to revise the theory---theory%1:09:00:: radically , and yet that theory---theory%1:09:00:: was what they regarded as their most important discovery---discovery%1:09:00:: .
It appeared that the theory---theory%1:09:00:: could be saved in one way---way%1:04:01:: only .
If it could be shown that judgments---judgment%1:04:02:: of good and bad were not judgments---judgment%1:04:02:: at all , that they asserted nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: true or false , but merely expressed emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: like `` Hurrah '' or `` Fiddlesticks '' , then these wayward judgments---judgment%1:04:02:: would cease from troubling and weary heads---head%1:09:00:: could be at rest .
This is the course---course%1:14:00:: the positivists---positivist%1:18:00:: took .
They explained value---value%1:07:00:: judgments---judgment%1:04:02:: by explaining them away .
Now I do not think their view---view%1:09:02:: will do .
But before discussing it , I should like to record one vote---vote%1:04:00:: of thanks---thanks%1:10:00:: to them for the clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: with which they have stated their case---case%1:10:01:: .
It has been said of John Stuart Mill---person%1:03:00:: that he wrote so clearly that he could be found out .
This theory---theory%1:09:00:: has been put so clearly and precisely that it deserves criticism---criticism%1:09:00:: of the same kind---kind%1:09:00:: , and this I will do my best to supply .
The theory---theory%1:09:00:: claims to show by analysis---analysis%1:10:00:: that when we say , `` That is good '' , we do not mean to assert a character---character%1:09:00:: of the subject---subject%1:10:01:: of which we are thinking .
Let us work through an example---example%1:09:00:: , and the simpler and commoner the better .
There is perhaps no value statement---value_statement%1:10:00:: on which people---people%1:14:00:: would more universally agree than the statement---statement%1:10:00:: that intense pain---pain%1:26:00:: is bad .
Let us take a set---set%1:14:00:: of circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: in which I happen to be interested on the legislative side---side%1:14:00:: and in which I think every one of us might naturally make such a statement---statement%1:10:00:: .
We come upon a rabbit---rabbit%1:05:00:: that has been caught in one of the brutal traps---trap%1:06:00:: in common use---use%1:04:00:: .
There are signs---sign%1:10:05:: that it has struggled for days---day%1:28:00:: to escape and that in a frenzy---frenzy%1:26:00:: of hunger---hunger%1:26:00:: , pain---pain%1:26:00:: , and fear---fear%1:12:00:: , it has all but eaten off its own leg---leg%1:08:01:: .
The attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: failed : the animal---animal%1:03:00:: is now dead .
As we think of the long and excruciating pain---pain%1:26:00:: it must have suffered , we are very likely to say : `` It was a bad thing---thing%1:26:00:: that the little animal---animal%1:03:00:: should suffer so '' .
The positivist---positivist%1:18:00:: tells us that when we say this we are only expressing our present emotion---emotion%1:12:00:: .
I hold , on the contrary , that we mean to assert something of the pain---pain%1:26:00:: itself , namely , that it was bad - bad when and as it occurred .
Consider what follows from the positivist---positivist%1:18:00:: view---view%1:09:02:: .
On that view---view%1:09:02:: , nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: good or bad happened in the case---case%1:11:00:: until I came on the scene---scene%1:15:00:: and made my remark---remark%1:10:00:: .
For what I express in my remark---remark%1:10:00:: is something going on in me at the time---time%1:28:00:: , and that of course did not exist until I did come on the scene---scene%1:15:00:: .
The pain---pain%1:26:00:: of the rabbit---rabbit%1:05:00:: was not itself bad ; nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: evil was happening when that pain---pain%1:26:00:: was being endured ; badness---badness%1:07:00:: , in the only sense---sense%1:10:00:: in which it is involved at all , waited for its appearance---appearance%1:11:00:: till I came and looked and felt .
Now that this is at odds with our meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: may be shown as follows .
Let us put to ourselves the hypothesis---hypothesis%1:10:00:: that we had not come on the scene---scene%1:15:00:: and that the rabbit---rabbit%1:05:00:: never was discovered .
Are we prepared to say that in that case---case%1:26:00:: nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: bad occurred in the sense---sense%1:10:00:: in which we said it did ?
Indeed we should say , on the contrary , that the accident---accident%1:11:00:: of our later discovery---discovery%1:04:00:: made no difference---difference%1:07:00:: whatever to the badness---badness%1:07:00:: of the animal---animal%1:03:00:: 's pain---pain%1:26:00:: , that it would have been every whit---whit%1:23:00:: as bad whether a chance passer-by---passerby%1:18:00:: happened later to discover the body---body%1:08:00:: and feel repugnance---repugnance%1:12:00:: or not .
If so , then it is clear that in saying the suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: was bad we are not expressing our feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: only .
We are saying that the pain---pain%1:26:00:: was bad when and as it occurred and before anyone took an attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: toward it .
The first argument---argument%1:10:02:: is thus an ideal experiment---experiment%1:04:00:: in which we use the method---method%1:09:00:: of difference---difference%1:07:00:: .
It removes our present expression---expression%1:10:00:: and shows that the badness---badness%1:07:00:: we meant would not be affected by this , whereas on positivist grounds---ground%1:16:00:: it should be .
The second argument---argument%1:10:02:: applies the method---method%1:09:00:: in the reverse way---way%1:07:01:: .
It ideally removes the past event---event%1:03:00:: , and shows that this would render false what we mean to say , whereas on positivist grounds---ground%1:16:00:: it should not .
Let us suppose that the animal---animal%1:03:00:: did not in fact fall into the trap---trap%1:06:00:: and did not suffer at all , but that we mistakenly believe it did , and say as before that its suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: was an evil thing---thing%1:26:00:: .
On the positivist theory---theory%1:09:00:: , everything I sought to express by calling it evil in the first case---case%1:11:00:: is still present in the second .
In the only sense---sense%1:10:00:: in which badness---badness%1:07:00:: is involved at all , whatever was bad in the first case---case%1:11:00:: is still present in its entirety---entirety%1:26:00:: , since all that is expressed in either case---case%1:11:00:: is a state---state%1:03:00:: of feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: , and that feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: is still there .
And our question---question%1:10:00:: is , is such an implication---implication%1:09:01:: consistent with what we meant ?
If anyone asked us , after we made the remark---remark%1:10:00:: that the suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: was a bad thing---thing%1:26:00:: , whether we should think it relevant to what we said to learn that the incident---incident%1:11:00:: had never occurred and no pain---pain%1:26:00:: had been suffered at all , we should say that it made all the difference---difference%1:11:00:: in the world , that what we were asserting to be bad was precisely the suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: we thought had occurred back there , that if this had not occurred , there was nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: left to be bad , and that our assertion---assertion%1:10:00:: was in that case---case%1:11:00:: mistaken .
The suggestion---suggestion%1:10:00:: that in saying something evil had occurred we were after all making no mistake---mistake%1:09:00:: , because we had never meant anyhow to say anything about the past suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: , seems to me merely frivolous .
If we did not mean to say this , why should we be so relieved on finding that the suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: had not occurred ?
On the theory---theory%1:09:00:: before us , such relief---relief%1:12:00:: would be groundless , for in that suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: itself there was nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: bad at all , and hence in its nonoccurrence---nonoccurrence%1:26:00:: there would be nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to be relieved about .
The positivist theory---theory%1:09:00:: would here distort our meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: beyond recognition---recognition%1:09:00:: .
So far as I can see , there is only one way out---way_out%1:06:00:: for the positivist---positivist%1:18:00:: .
He holds that goodness---goodness%1:07:02:: and badness---badness%1:07:00:: lie in feelings---feeling%1:03:00:: of approval---approval%1:12:00:: or disapproval---disapproval%1:12:00:: .
And there is a way---way%1:04:01:: in which he might hold that badness---badness%1:07:00:: did in this case---case%1:26:00:: precede our own feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: of disapproval---disapproval%1:12:00:: without belonging to the pain---pain%1:26:00:: itself .
The pain---pain%1:26:00:: in itself was neutral ; but unfortunately the rabbit---rabbit%1:05:00:: , on no grounds---ground%1:16:00:: at all , took up toward this neutral object---object%1:09:01:: an attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of disapproval---disapproval%1:12:00:: and that made it for the first time , and in the only intelligible sense---sense%1:10:00:: , bad .
This way---way%1:04:01:: of escape---escape%1:04:01:: is theoretically possible , but since it has grave difficulties---difficulty%1:07:00:: of its own and has not , so far as I know , been urged by positivists---positivist%1:18:00:: , it is perhaps best not to spend time---time%1:28:05:: over it .
I come now to a third argument---argument%1:10:02:: , which again is very simple .
When we come upon the rabbit---rabbit%1:05:00:: and make our remark---remark%1:10:00:: about its suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: being a bad thing---thing%1:26:00:: , we presumably make it with some feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: ; the positivists---positivist%1:18:00:: are plainly right in saying that such remarks---remark%1:10:00:: do usually express feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: .
But suppose that a week---week%1:28:00:: later we revert to the incident---incident%1:11:00:: in thought---thought%1:09:01:: and make our statement---statement%1:10:00:: again .
And suppose that the circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: have now so changed that the feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: with which we made the remark---remark%1:10:00:: in the first place has faded .
The pathetic evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: is no longer before us ; and we are now so fatigued in body---body%1:08:00:: and mind---mind%1:09:00:: that feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: is , as we say , quite dead .
In these circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: , since what was expressed by the remark---remark%1:10:00:: when first made is , on the theory---theory%1:09:00:: before us , simply absent , the remark---remark%1:10:00:: now expresses nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
It is as empty as the word---word%1:10:00:: `` Hurrah '' would be when there was no enthusiasm---enthusiasm%1:12:00:: behind it .
When we repeat the remark---remark%1:10:00:: that such suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: was a bad thing---thing%1:26:00:: , the feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: with which we made it last week---week%1:28:00:: may be at or near the vanishing point---vanishing_point%1:15:00:: , but if we were asked whether we meant to say what we did before , we should certainly answer Yes .
We should say that we made our point---point%1:09:02:: with feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: the first time---time%1:11:00:: and little or no feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: the second time---time%1:11:00:: , but that it was the same point---point%1:09:02:: we were making .
And if we can see that what we meant to say remains the same , while the feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: varies from intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: to near zero , it is not the feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: that we primarily meant to express .
I come now to a fourth consideration---consideration%1:09:00:: .
We all believe that toward acts---act%1:03:00:: or effects---effect%1:19:00:: of a certain kind---kind%1:09:00:: one attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: is fitting and another not ; but on the theory---theory%1:09:00:: before us such a belief---belief%1:09:01:: would not make sense .
Broad---person%1:03:00:: and Ross---person%1:03:00:: have lately contended that this fitness---fitness%1:07:00:: is one of the main facts---fact%1:10:01:: of ethics---ethics%1:16:00:: , and I suspect they are right .
But that is not exactly my point---point%1:10:01:: .
My point---point%1:10:01:: is this :
whether there is such fitness---fitness%1:07:00:: or not , we all assume that there is , and if we do , we express in moral judgments---judgment%1:09:04:: more than the subjectivists---subjectivist%1:18:00:: say we do .
In his novel---novel%1:10:00:: The House of the Dead , Dostoevsky---person%1:03:00:: tells of his experiences---experience%1:09:01:: in a Siberian---location%1:03:00:: prison camp---prison_camp%1:06:01:: .
Whatever the unhappy inmates---inmate%1:18:02:: of such camps---camp%1:06:02:: are like today---today%1:28:00:: , Dostoevsky---person%1:03:00:: 's companions---companion%1:18:00:: were about as grim a lot---lot%1:14:00:: as can be imagined .
`` I have heard stories---story%1:10:03:: '' , he writes , `` of the most terrible , the most unnatural actions---action%1:04:02:: , of the most monstrous murders---murder%1:04:00:: , told with the most spontaneous , childishly merry laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: '' .
Most of us would say that in this delight---delight%1:12:00:: at the killing---killing%1:11:00:: of others or the causing of suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: there is something very unfitting .
If we were asked why we thought so , we should say that these things---thing%1:04:00:: involve great evil---evil%1:04:00:: and are wrong , and that to take delight---delight%1:12:00:: in what is evil---evil%1:04:00:: or wrong is plainly unfitting .
Now---now%1:28:00:: on the subjectivist---subjectivist%1:18:00:: view---view%1:09:02:: , this answer---answer%1:10:01:: is ruled out .
For before someone---someone%1:03:00:: takes up an attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: toward death---death%1:28:00:: , suffering---suffering%1:26:00:: , or their infliction---infliction%1:04:01:: , they have no moral quality---quality%1:07:00:: at all .
There is therefore nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: about them to which an attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of approval---approval%1:12:00:: or condemnation---condemnation%1:04:00:: could be fitting .
They are in themselves neutral , and , so far as they get a moral quality---quality%1:07:00:: , they get it only through being invested with it by the attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: of the onlooker---onlooker%1:18:00:: .
But if that is true , why is any attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: more fitting than any other ?
Would applause---applause%1:10:00:: , for example , be fitting if , apart from the applause---applause%1:10:00:: , there were nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: good to applaud ?
Would condemnation---condemnation%1:04:00:: be fitting if , independently of the condemnation---condemnation%1:04:00:: , there were nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: bad to condemn ?
In such a case---case%1:26:00:: , any attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: would be as fitting or unfitting as any other , which means that the notion---notion%1:09:00:: of fitness---fitness%1:07:00:: has lost all point---point%1:10:01:: .
If goodness---goodness%1:07:02:: and badness---badness%1:07:00:: lie in attitudes---attitude%1:09:00:: only and hence are brought into being---being%1:26:00:: by them , those men---man%1:18:00:: who greeted death---death%1:28:00:: and misery---misery%1:26:00:: with childishly merry laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: are taking the only sensible line---line%1:09:01:: .
If there is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: evil in these things---thing%1:04:00:: , if they get their moral complexion---complexion%1:07:00:: only from our feeling---feeling%1:03:00:: about them , why should n't they be greeted with a cheer---cheer%1:10:00:: ?
To greet them with repulsion---repulsion%1:12:00:: would turn what before was neutral into something bad ; it would needlessly bring badness---badness%1:07:00:: into the world---world%1:17:01:: ; and even on subjectivist---subjectivist%1:18:00:: assumptions---assumption%1:10:00:: that does not seem very bright .
On the other hand , to greet them with delight---delight%1:12:00:: would convert what before was neutral into something good ; it would bring goodness---goodness%1:07:02:: into the world---world%1:17:01:: .
Television---television%1:10:00:: has yet to work out a living arrangement---living_arrangement%1:09:00:: with jazz , which comes to the medium---medium%1:10:01:: more as an uneasy guest---guest%1:18:00:: than as a relaxed member---member%1:18:00:: of the family---family%1:14:02:: .
There seems to be an unfortunate assumption---assumption%1:09:00:: that an hour---hour%1:28:00:: of Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: style---style%1:07:00:: jazz in prime---prime_time%1:28:00:: evening---evening%1:28:00:: time , for example , could not be justified without the trimmings---trimming%1:04:00:: of a portentous documentary---documentary%1:10:00:: .
At least this seemed to be the working hypothesis---hypothesis%1:10:00:: for `` Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: and All That Jazz '' , presented on NBC---group%1:03:00:: - TV---tv%1:10:00:: Nov.---nov%1:28:00:: 26 .
The program---program%1:10:01:: came out of the NBC---group%1:03:00:: Special Projects---project%1:04:00:: department---department%1:14:00:: , and was slotted in the Du Pont Show of the Week---week%1:28:00:: series---series%1:10:01:: .
Perhaps Special Projects---project%1:04:00:: necessarily thinks along documentary---documentary%1:10:00:: lines---line%1:09:01:: .
If so , it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show---show%1:04:00:: to a different department---department%1:14:00:: - one with enough confidence---confidence%1:09:00:: in the musical material---material%1:27:00:: to cut down on the number---number%1:23:00:: of performers---performer%1:18:00:: and give them a little room---room%1:26:00:: to display their talents---talent%1:09:00:: .
As a matter of fact , this latter approach---approach%1:04:02:: has already been tried , and with pleasing results---result%1:11:00:: .
A few years---year%1:28:01:: ago a `` Timex---group%1:03:00:: All Star---star%1:18:01:: Jazz Show---show%1:04:00:: '' offered a broad range---range%1:07:00:: of styles---style%1:07:00:: , ranging from Lionel Hampton---person%1:03:00:: 's big band---big_band%1:14:00:: to the free-wheeling Dukes of Dixieland---group%1:03:00:: .
An enthusiastic audience---audience%1:14:00:: confirmed the `` live '' character---character%1:09:00:: of the hour---hour%1:28:00:: , and provided the interaction---interaction%1:04:00:: between musician---musician%1:18:01:: and hearer---hearer%1:18:00:: which almost always seems to improve the quality---quality%1:07:00:: of performance---performance%1:10:00:: .
About that same time---time%1:11:00:: John Crosby---person%1:03:00:: 's TV---tv%1:10:00:: series---series%1:10:01:: on the popular arts---art%1:04:00:: proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space---breathing_space%1:28:00:: is one of the most sensible things---thing%1:04:00:: a producer---producer%1:18:02:: can do .
In an hour---hour%1:28:00:: remembered for its almost rudderless movement---movement%1:04:00:: , a score---score%1:14:00:: of jazz luminaries---luminary%1:18:00:: went before the cameras---camera%1:06:01:: for lengthy periods---period%1:28:00:: .
The program---program%1:10:01:: had been arranged to permit the establishment---establishment%1:04:00:: of a mood---mood%1:26:00:: of intense concentration---concentration%1:09:00:: on the music---music%1:04:00:: .
Cameras---camera%1:06:01:: stared at soloists---soloist%1:18:00:: ' faces---face%1:08:00:: in extreme closeups---closeup%1:06:00:: , then considerately pulled back for full views---view%1:04:00:: of ensemble---ensemble%1:14:02:: work---work%1:04:00:: .
`` Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: and All That Jazz '' could not be faulted on the choice---choice%1:09:00:: of artists---artist%1:18:00:: .
Some of the in-person performers---performer%1:18:00:: were Jack Teagarden---person%1:03:00:: , Gene Krupa---person%1:03:00:: , Bud Freeman---person%1:03:00:: , Pee Wee Russell---person%1:03:00:: , Johnny St. Cyr---person%1:03:00:: , Joe Sullivan---person%1:03:00:: , Red Allen---person%1:03:00:: , Lil Armstrong---person%1:03:00:: , Blossom Seeley---person%1:03:00:: .
The jazz buff---buff%1:18:00:: could hardly ask for more .
Furthermore , Garry Moore---person%1:03:00:: makes an ideal master of ceremonies---master_of_ceremonies%1:18:00:: .
( He played host---host%1:18:01:: at the Timex---group%1:03:00:: show---show%1:04:00:: already mentioned . )
One of the script---script%1:10:00:: 's big problems---problem%1:26:00:: was how to blend pictures---picture%1:10:00:: and music---music%1:10:00:: of the past---past%1:28:00:: with live performances---performance%1:10:00:: by musicians---musician%1:18:01:: of today---today%1:28:00:: .
NBC---group%1:03:00:: had gathered a lot of historical material---material%1:10:00:: which it was eager to share .
For example , there was sheet music---sheet_music%1:10:00:: with the word---word%1:10:00:: `` jazz '' in the title---title%1:10:00:: , to illustrate how a word---word%1:10:00:: of uncertain origin---origin%1:15:00:: took hold .
Samples---sample%1:09:00:: zoomed into closeup---closeup%1:06:00:: range---range%1:07:00:: in regular succession---succession%1:04:00:: , like telephone poles---telephone_pole%1:06:00:: passing on the highway---highway%1:06:00:: , while representative music---music%1:10:00:: reinforced the mood---mood%1:26:00:: of the late teens---teens%1:28:00:: and 1920 's .
However well chosen and cleverly arranged , such memorabilia---memorabilia%1:10:00:: unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption---interruption%1:04:00:: than an auxiliary---auxiliary%1:18:00:: to the evening---evening%1:28:00:: 's main business---business%1:09:00:: , which ( considering the talent---talent%1:09:00:: at hand ) should probably have been the gathering---gathering%1:04:01:: of fresh samples---sample%1:09:00:: of the Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: style---style%1:07:00:: .
Another source---source%1:15:00:: of NBC---group%1:03:00:: pride---pride%1:12:01:: was its rare film clip---film_clip%1:10:00:: of Bix Beiderbecke---person%1:03:00:: , but this view---view%1:09:01:: of the great trumpeter---trumpeter%1:18:00:: flew by so fast that a prolonged wink---wink%1:28:00:: would have blotted out the entire glimpse---glimpse%1:04:00:: .
Similarly , in presenting still photographs---photograph%1:06:00:: of early jazz groups---jazz_group%1:14:00:: , the program---program%1:10:01:: allowed no time---time%1:28:05:: for a close perusal---perusal%1:10:00:: .
`` Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: and All That Jazz '' may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan---fan%1:18:00:: nor the inquisitive newcomer---newcomer%1:18:00:: .
By trying to be both a serious survey---survey%1:10:00:: of a bygone era---era%1:28:00:: and a showcase---showcase%1:26:00:: for today---today%1:28:00:: 's artists---artist%1:18:00:: , the program---program%1:10:01:: turned out to be a not quite perfect example---example%1:09:00:: of either .
Still , the network---network%1:06:01:: 's willingness---willingness%1:07:00:: to experiment in this musical field---field%1:09:00:: is to be commended , and future essays---essay%1:04:00:: happily anticipated .
Even Joan Sutherland---person%1:03:00:: may not have anticipated the tremendous reception---reception%1:10:01:: she received from the Metropolitan Opera audience---audience%1:14:00:: attending her debut---debut%1:04:00:: as Lucia---person%1:03:00:: in Donizetti---person%1:03:00:: 's `` Lucia di Lammermoor '' Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: .
The crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: staged its own mad scene---scene%1:15:00:: in salvos---salvo%1:04:00:: of cheers---cheer%1:10:00:: and applause---applause%1:10:00:: and finally a standing ovation---standing_ovation%1:10:00:: as Miss Sutherland---person%1:03:00:: took curtain call---curtain_call%1:10:00:: after curtain call---curtain_call%1:10:00:: following a fantastic `` Mad Scene '' created on her own and with the help---help%1:04:00:: of the composer---composer%1:18:00:: and the other performers---performer%1:18:00:: .
Her entrance---entrance%1:04:00:: in Scene 2 , Act 1 , brought some disconcerting applause---applause%1:10:00:: even before she had sung a note---note%1:10:04:: .
Thereafter the audience---audience%1:14:00:: waxed applause---applause%1:10:00:: happy , but discriminating operagoers---operagoer%1:18:00:: reserved judgment---judgment%1:09:04:: as her singing---singing%1:04:00:: showed signs---sign%1:10:05:: of strain---strain%1:19:00:: , her musicianship---musicianship%1:09:00:: some questionable procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: and her acting---acting%1:04:00:: uncomfortable stylization---stylization%1:04:00:: .
As she gained composure---composure%1:07:00:: during the second act---act%1:10:00:: , her technical resourcefulness---resourcefulness%1:07:00:: emerged stronger , though she had already revealed a trill---trill%1:10:00:: almost unprecedented in years---year%1:28:01:: of performances---performance%1:10:00:: of `` Lucia '' .
She topped the sextet---sextet%1:10:00:: brilliantly .
Each high note---note%1:10:04:: had the crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: in ecstasy---ecstasy%1:26:00:: so that it stopped the show---show%1:04:00:: midway in the `` Mad Scene '' , but the real reason---reason%1:10:01:: was a realization---realization%1:04:00:: of the extraordinary performance---performance%1:10:00:: unfolding at the moment---moment%1:28:00:: .
Miss Sutherland---person%1:03:00:: appeared almost as another person---person%1:03:00:: in this scene---scene%1:10:00:: : A much more girlish Lucia---person%1:03:00:: , a sensational coloratura---coloratura%1:18:00:: who ran across stage---stage%1:06:00:: while singing---singing%1:04:00:: , and an actress---actress%1:18:00:: immersed in her role---role%1:09:00:: .
What followed the outburst---outburst%1:10:00:: brought almost breathless silence---silence%1:07:00:: as Miss Sutherland---person%1:03:00:: revealed her mastery---mastery%1:09:00:: of a voice---voice%1:10:00:: probably unique among sopranos---soprano%1:18:00:: today---today%1:28:00:: .
This big , flexible voice---voice%1:10:00:: with uncommon range---range%1:07:00:: has been superbly disciplined .
Nervousness---nervousness%1:12:00:: at the start must have caused the blemishes---blemish%1:07:00:: of her first scene---scene%1:10:00:: , or she may warm up slowly .
In the fullness---fullness%1:07:02:: of her vocal splendor---splendor%1:07:00:: , however , she could sing the famous scene---scene%1:10:00:: magnificently .
Many years---year%1:28:01:: have passed since a Metropolitan audience---audience%1:14:00:: heard anything comparable .
Her debut---debut%1:04:00:: over , perhaps the earlier scenes---scene%1:10:00:: will emerge equally fine .
The performance---performance%1:10:00:: also marked the debut---debut%1:04:00:: of a most promising young conductor---conductor%1:18:00:: , Silvio Varviso---person%1:03:00:: .
He injected more vitality---vitality%1:07:01:: into the score---score%1:10:00:: than it has revealed in many years---year%1:28:01:: .
He may respect too much the Italian tradition---tradition%1:09:02:: of letting singers---singer%1:18:00:: hold on to their notes---note%1:10:04:: , but to restrain them in a singers---singer%1:18:00:: ' opera---opera%1:10:00:: may be quite difficult .
Richard Tucker---person%1:03:00:: sang Edgardo---person%1:03:00:: in glorious voice---voice%1:10:00:: .
His bel canto---bel_canto%1:04:00:: style---style%1:10:00:: gave the performance---performance%1:10:00:: a special distinction---distinction%1:26:00:: .
The remainder---remainder%1:24:00:: of the cast---cast%1:14:00:: fulfilled its assignments---assignment%1:04:00:: no more than satisfactorily just as the old production---production%1:10:00:: and limited stage direction---stage_direction%1:10:00:: proved only serviceable .
Miss Sutherland---person%1:03:00:: first sang Lucia---person%1:03:00:: at Covent Garden---location%1:03:00:: in 1959 .
( The first Metropolitan Opera---group%1:03:00:: broadcast---broadcast%1:10:00:: on Dec.---dec%1:28:00:: 9 will introduce her as Lucia---person%1:03:00:: . )
She has since turned to Bellini---person%1:03:00:: , whose opera---opera%1:10:00:: `` Beatrice di Tenda '' in a concert---concert%1:10:00:: version---version%1:10:01:: with the American Opera Society---group%1:03:00:: introduced her to New York---new_york%1:15:01:: last season---season%1:28:02:: .
She will sing `` La Sonambula '' with it here next week---week%1:28:00:: .
Anyone for musical Ping-pong---ping-pong%1:04:00:: ?
It 's really quite fun - as long as you like games---game%1:04:01:: .
You will need a stereo---stereo%1:06:00:: music---music%1:09:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: , with speakers---speaker%1:06:00:: preferably placed at least seven or eight feet---foot%1:23:00:: apart , and one---one%1:23:00:: or more of the new London---london%1:15:00:: `` Phase---phase%1:28:00:: 4 '' records---record%1:06:00:: .
There are 12---12%1:23:00:: of these to choose from , all of them of popular music---popular_music%1:10:00:: except for the star release---release%1:10:00:: , Pass in Review ( SP 44001 ) .
This features the marching songs---song%1:10:00:: of several nations---nation%1:14:00:: , recorded as though the various national bands---band%1:14:02:: were marching by your reviewing stand---reviewing_stand%1:06:00:: .
Complete with crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: effects---effect%1:09:00:: , interruptions---interruption%1:04:00:: by jet planes---jet_plane%1:06:00:: , and sundry other touches---touch%1:07:01:: of realism , this disc---disc%1:06:01:: displays London---london%1:15:00:: 's new technique---technique%1:09:00:: to the best effect---effect%1:07:00:: .
All of the jackets---jacket%1:06:01:: carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation---explanation%1:10:00:: of this new recording---recording%1:04:00:: program---program%1:09:00:: .
No reference---reference%1:10:02:: is made to the possibility---possibility%1:09:03:: of recording other than popular music---popular_music%1:10:00:: in this manner---manner%1:07:02:: , and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music---serious_music%1:10:00:: .
Directionality---directionality%1:07:00:: is greatly exaggerated most of the time---time%1:11:00:: ; but when the sounds---sound%1:10:00:: of the two---two%1:23:00:: speakers---speaker%1:18:00:: are allowed to mix , there is excellent depth---depth%1:07:00:: and dimension---dimension%1:09:00:: to the music---music%1:09:00:: .
You definitely hear some of the instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: close up and others farther back , with the difference---difference%1:07:00:: in placement---placement%1:07:00:: apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: merely being louder than the ones farther back .
This is a characteristic---characteristic%1:09:00:: of good stereo---stereo%1:06:00:: recording---recording%1:06:00:: and one---one%1:23:00:: of its tremendous advantages---advantage%1:07:00:: over monaural sound---sound%1:10:00:: .
London---group%1:03:00:: explains that the very distinct directional effect---effect%1:09:00:: in the Phase---phase%1:28:00:: 4 series---series%1:14:00:: is due in large part to their novel methods---method%1:09:00:: of microphoning---microphoning%1:22:00:: and recording---recording%1:04:00:: the music---music%1:09:00:: on a number---number%1:07:00:: of separate tape---tape%1:06:01:: channels---channel%1:10:00:: .
These are then mixed by their sound---sound%1:10:00:: engineers---engineer%1:18:00:: with the active co-operation---cooperation%1:04:01:: of the musical staff---staff%1:14:01:: and combined into the final two---two%1:23:00:: channels---channel%1:10:00:: which are impressed on the record---record%1:06:00:: .
In some of the numbers---number%1:10:04:: the instrumental parts---part%1:10:00:: have even been recorded at different times---time%1:11:00:: and then later combined on the master---master%1:06:00:: tape---tape%1:06:01:: to produce special effects---special_effect%1:09:00:: .
Some clue---clue%1:10:00:: to the character---character%1:09:00:: of London---group%1:03:00:: 's approach---approach%1:04:02:: in these discs---disc%1:06:01:: may be gained immediately from the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that ten---ten%1:23:00:: of the 12 titles---title%1:10:01:: include the word---word%1:10:00:: `` percussion---percussion%1:04:01:: '' or `` percussive '' .
Drums---drum%1:06:00:: , xylophones---xylophone%1:06:00:: , castanets---castanets%1:06:00:: , and other percussive instruments---percussive_instrument%1:06:00:: are reproduced remarkably well .
Only too often , however , you have the feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: that you are sitting in a room---room%1:06:00:: with some of the instruments---instrument%1:06:00:: lined up on one wall---wall%1:06:00:: to your left---left%1:15:00:: and others facing them on the wall---wall%1:06:00:: to your right---right%1:15:00:: .
They are definitely in the same room---room%1:06:00:: with you , but your head---head%1:08:00:: starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge---edge%1:15:00:: of a tennis court---tennis_court%1:06:00:: watching a spirited volley---volley%1:04:01:: .
The Percussive Twenties---twenties%1:28:01:: ( SP 44006 ) stirs pleasant memories---memory%1:09:00:: with well-known songs---song%1:10:00:: of that day---day%1:28:03:: , and Johnny Keating---person%1:03:00:: 's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in Percussive Moods ( SP 44005 ) .
Big Band Percussion ( SP 44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs---disc%1:06:01:: - the arrangements---arrangement%1:10:00:: just did n't have so much character---character%1:07:01:: as the others .
There is an extraordinary sense---sense%1:09:05:: of presence---presence%1:09:00:: in all of these recordings---recording%1:06:00:: , apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle---middle%1:15:00:: and high frequencies---high_frequency%1:07:00:: .
The penalty---penalty%1:07:00:: for this is noticeable in the big , bold , brilliant , but brassy piano---piano%1:06:00:: sounds---sound%1:19:00:: in Melody and Percussion for Two Pianos ( SP 44007 ) .
All of the releases---release%1:06:00:: , however , are recorded at a gratifyingly high level---level%1:07:00:: , with resultant masking---masking%1:04:00:: of any surface noise---surface_noise%1:11:00:: .
Pass in Review practically guarantees enjoyment---enjoyment%1:12:00:: , and is a dramatic demonstration---demonstration%1:04:00:: of the potentialities---potentiality%1:26:00:: of any stereo---stereo%1:06:00:: music---music%1:09:00:: system---system%1:06:00:: .
Many Hollywood---hollywood%1:14:00:: films---film%1:10:01:: manage somehow to be authentic , but not realistic .
Strange , but true - authenticity---authenticity%1:07:00:: and realism often are n't related at all .
Almost every film---film%1:10:01:: bearing the imprimatur---imprimatur%1:10:00:: of Hollywood---hollywood%1:14:00:: is physically authentic - in fact , impeccably so .
In any given period piece---period_piece%1:06:00:: the costumes---costume%1:06:00:: , bric-a-brac---bric-a-brac%1:06:00:: , vehicles---vehicle%1:06:00:: , and decor---decor%1:06:00:: , bear the stamp---stamp%1:10:00:: of unimpeachable authenticity---authenticity%1:07:00:: .
The major studios---studio%1:06:00:: maintain a cadre---cadre%1:14:01:: of film---film%1:10:00:: librarians---librarian%1:18:00:: and research---research%1:04:00:: specialists---specialist%1:18:00:: who look to this matter---matter%1:09:00:: .
During the making---making%1:04:00:: recently of an important Biblical film---film%1:10:01:: , some 40 volumes---volume%1:06:00:: of research---research%1:04:00:: material---material%1:10:00:: and sketches---sketch%1:06:00:: not only of costumes---costume%1:06:00:: and interiors---interior%1:15:01:: , but of architectural developments---development%1:15:00:: , sports arenas---sports_arena%1:06:00:: , vehicles---vehicle%1:06:00:: , and other paraphernalia---paraphernalia%1:06:00:: were compiled , consulted , and complied with .
But , alas , the authenticity---authenticity%1:07:00:: seems to stop at the set---set%1:06:00:: 's edge---edge%1:15:00:: .
The drama---drama%1:10:01:: itself - and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama---drama%1:10:01:: - often has hardly any relationship---relationship%1:26:00:: with authenticity---authenticity%1:07:00:: at all .
The storyline---storyline%1:10:00:: , in sort---sort%1:09:00:: , is wildly unrealistic .
Thus , in `` The Story of Ruth '' we have Ruth---person%1:03:00:: , Naomi---person%1:03:00:: , and Boaz---person%1:03:00:: and sets---set%1:06:00:: that are meticulously authentic .
But except for a vague adherence---adherence%1:04:00:: to the basic storyline---storyline%1:10:00:: - i.e. , that Ruth---person%1:03:00:: remained with Naomi---person%1:03:00:: and finally wound up with Boaz---person%1:03:00:: - the film---film%1:10:01:: version---version%1:10:01:: has little---little%1:23:00:: to do with the Bible---bible%1:10:00:: .
And in the new `` King of Kings '' the plot---plot%1:10:00:: involves intrigues---intrigue%1:09:00:: and twists---twist%1:11:00:: and turns---turn%1:11:01:: that cannot be traced to the Gospels---gospels%1:10:00:: .
Earlier this month---month%1:28:01:: Edward R. Murrow---person%1:03:00:: , director---director%1:18:00:: of the United States Information Agency---group%1:03:00:: , came to Hollywood---hollywood%1:14:00:: and had dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: with more than 100 leaders---leader%1:18:00:: of the motion picture---motion_picture%1:10:00:: industry---industry%1:14:00:: .
He talked about unauthentic storylines---storyline%1:10:00:: too .
He intimated that they were n't doing the country---country%1:14:00:: much good---good%1:07:01:: in the Cold War---cold_war%1:26:00:: .
And to an industry---industry%1:14:00:: that prides---pride%1:12:01:: itself on authenticity---authenticity%1:07:00:: , he urged greater realism .
`` in many corners---corner%1:15:02:: of the globe---globe%1:17:00:: '' , he said , `` the major source---source%1:10:00:: of impressions---impression%1:09:00:: about this country---country%1:14:00:: are in the movies---movie%1:10:00:: they meet .
Would we want a future-day Gibbon---person%1:03:00:: or Macaulay---person%1:03:00:: recounting the saga---saga%1:10:00:: of America---america%1:15:00:: with movies---movie%1:10:00:: as his prime source---source%1:10:00:: of knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: ?
Yet for much---much%1:23:00:: of the globe---globe%1:17:00:: , Hollywood---hollywood%1:14:00:: is just that - prime , if not sole , source---source%1:10:00:: of knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: .
If a man---man%1:05:01:: totally ignorant of America---america%1:15:00:: were to judge our land---land%1:14:01:: and its civilization---civilization%1:14:00:: based on Hollywood---hollywood%1:14:00:: alone , what conclusions---conclusion%1:09:00:: do you think he might come to ?
There is a pause---pause%1:28:00:: in the merriment---merriment%1:04:00:: as your friends---friend%1:18:00:: gaze at you , wondering why you are staring , open-mouthed in amazement---amazement%1:12:00:: .
You explain , `` I have the strangest feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: of having lived through this very same event---event%1:03:00:: before .
I can n't tell when , but I'm positive I witnessed this same scene---scene%1:09:00:: of this particular gathering---gathering%1:14:00:: at some time---time%1:28:05:: in the past---past%1:28:01:: '' !
This experience---experience%1:11:00:: will have happened to many of you .
Emerson---person%1:03:00:: , in his lecture---lecture%1:10:00:: , refers to the `` startling experience---experience%1:11:00:: which almost every person---person%1:03:00:: confesses in daylight---daylight%1:19:00:: , that particular passages---passage%1:10:00:: of conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: and action---action%1:04:02:: have occurred to him in the same order---order%1:14:00:: before , whether dreaming or waking , a suspicion---suspicion%1:09:01:: that they have been with precisely these persons---person%1:03:00:: in precisely this room---room%1:06:00:: , and heard precisely this dialogue---dialogue%1:10:01:: , at some former hour---hour%1:28:01:: , they know not when '' .
Most psychiatrists---psychiatrist%1:18:00:: dismiss these instances---instance%1:11:00:: of that weird feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: as the deja vu---deja_vu%1:09:00:: ( already seen ) illusion---illusion%1:09:01:: , just as they dismiss dream previsions---prevision%1:09:01:: as coincidences---coincidence%1:11:00:: .
In this manner---manner%1:07:02:: they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation---investigation%1:09:00:: of the greater depths---depth%1:07:00:: of mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: in which all of us grope continually .
When a man---man%1:18:00:: recognizes a certain experience---experience%1:11:00:: as the exact pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: of a previous dream---dream%1:09:01:: , we have an instance---instance%1:11:00:: of deja vu---deja_vu%1:09:00:: , except for the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that he knows just why the experience---experience%1:11:00:: seems familiar .
Occasionally there are examples---example%1:09:00:: of prevision---prevision%1:09:01:: which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: .
One day---day%1:28:03:: Maeterlinck---person%1:03:00:: , coming with a friend---friend%1:18:00:: upon an event---event%1:03:00:: which he recognized as the exact pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: of a previous dream---dream%1:09:01:: , detailed the ensuing occurrences---occurrence%1:11:00:: in advance so accurately that his companion---companion%1:18:00:: was completely mystified .
Rudyard Kipling---person%1:03:00:: 's scorn---scorn%1:12:00:: for the `` jargon---jargon%1:10:00:: '' of psychical research---research%1:04:00:: was altered somewhat when he wondered `` how , or why , had I been shown an unreleased roll---roll%1:06:01:: of my life---life%1:28:01:: film---film%1:10:01:: '' ?
The famous author---author%1:18:00:: tells us of the strange incident---incident%1:11:00:: in Something About Myself .
One day---day%1:28:03:: when he attended a war---war%1:26:00:: memorial---memorial%1:10:00:: ceremony---ceremony%1:11:00:: in Westminster Abbey---group%1:03:00:: his view---view%1:04:00:: was obstructed by a stout man---man%1:18:00:: on his left---left%1:15:00:: , his attention---attention%1:09:00:: turned to the irregular pattern---pattern%1:06:00:: of the rough slab---slab%1:06:00:: flooring---flooring%1:06:00:: and someone---someone%1:03:00:: , clasping him by the arm---arm%1:08:00:: , whispered , `` I want a word---word%1:10:04:: with you , please '' .
At that moment---moment%1:28:00:: Kipling---person%1:03:00:: was overwhelmed with awed amazement---amazement%1:12:00:: , suddenly recalling that these identical details---details%1:10:00:: of scene---scene%1:15:00:: , action---action%1:04:02:: and word---word%1:10:04:: had occurred to him in a dream---dream%1:09:01:: six weeks---week%1:28:00:: earlier .
Freud---person%1:03:00:: probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding---understanding%1:09:01:: of dreams---dream%1:09:01:: , enabling us to recognize their equivalents---equivalent%1:09:00:: in our wakeful thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: .
However , readers---reader%1:18:00:: who accept Freud---person%1:03:00:: 's findings---finding%1:04:00:: and believe that he has solved completely the mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: of dreams---dream%1:09:01:: , should ponder over the following words---words%1:10:02:: in his Interpretation Of Dreams , Chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: 1 , : `` as a matter of fact no such complete solution---solution%1:10:00:: of the dream---dream%1:09:01:: has ever been accomplished in any case , and what is more , every one attempting such solution---solution%1:10:00:: has found that in most cases---case%1:11:00:: there have remained a great many components---component%1:09:00:: of the dream---dream%1:09:01:: the source---source%1:09:00:: of which he has been unable to explain , nor is the discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: closed on the subject---subject%1:10:00:: of the mantic or prophetic power---power%1:07:00:: of dreams---dream%1:09:01:: '' .
Dreams---dream%1:09:01:: present many mysteries---mystery%1:09:00:: of telepathy---telepathy%1:10:00:: , clairvoyance---clairvoyance%1:10:00:: , prevision---prevision%1:09:01:: and retrovision---retrovision%1:09:00:: .
The basic mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: of dreams---dream%1:09:01:: , which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream---dream%1:09:01:: , is in the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that they are original , visual continuities---continuity%1:26:00:: .
I recall the startling , vivid realism---realism%1:07:00:: of a dream---dream%1:09:01:: in which I lived through the horror---horror%1:12:01:: of the bombing---bombing%1:04:00:: of a little Korean town---town%1:15:00:: .
I am sure that nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence---sequence%1:07:00:: , so complete in detail , from the hodge-podge---hodgepodge%1:14:00:: of news---news%1:10:02:: pictures---picture%1:06:00:: I have seen .
And when psychology---psychology%1:09:00:: explains glibly , `` but the subconscious mind---subconscious_mind%1:09:00:: is able to produce it '' it refers to a mental region---region%1:15:00:: so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind---mind%1:09:00:: as conceivably as part---part%1:17:00:: of the individual mind---mind%1:09:00:: .
Skeptics---skeptic%1:18:00:: may deny the more startling phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: of dreams---dream%1:09:01:: as things---thing%1:11:00:: they have never personally observed , but failure---failure%1:04:00:: to wonder at their basic mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: is outright avoidance---avoidance%1:04:00:: of routine evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: .
The question---question%1:10:00:: becomes , `` What is a dream---dream%1:09:01:: '' ?
Is a dream---dream%1:09:01:: simply a mental or cerebral movie---movie%1:10:00:: ?
Every dream---dream%1:09:01:: , and this is true of a mental image---mental_image%1:09:00:: of any type---type%1:09:00:: even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent---equivalent%1:09:00:: of wakeful thought---thought%1:09:00:: , is a psychic phenomenon---psychic_phenomenon%1:10:00:: for which no explanation---explanation%1:09:00:: is available .
In most cases---case%1:11:00:: we recognize certain words---words%1:10:03:: , persons---person%1:03:00:: , animals---animal%1:03:00:: or objects---object%1:03:00:: .
But these are dreamed in original action---action%1:04:02:: , in some particular continuity---continuity%1:26:00:: which we do n't remember having seen in real life---real_life%1:09:00:: .
For instance , the dreamer---dreamer%1:18:02:: sees himself seated behind neighbor---neighbor%1:18:00:: Smith---person%1:03:00:: and , with photographic realism---realism%1:07:00:: , sees Smith---person%1:03:00:: driving the car---car%1:06:00:: ; whereas , it is a matter---matter%1:09:01:: of fact---fact%1:09:01:: that Smith---person%1:03:00:: cannot drive a car---car%1:06:00:: .
There is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to suggest that the brain---brain%1:18:00:: can alter past impressions---impression%1:09:00:: to fit into an original , realistic and unbroken continuity---continuity%1:26:00:: like we experience in dreams---dream%1:09:01:: .
The entire concept---concept%1:09:00:: of cerebral imagery---imagery%1:09:00:: as the physical basis---basis%1:09:00:: of a mental image---mental_image%1:09:00:: can find no logical support---support%1:09:00:: .
A `` mental image---mental_image%1:09:00:: '' subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language---language%1:09:01:: symbols---symbol%1:10:00:: in wakeful thought---thought%1:09:00:: , or consciously in light sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: , is actually not an image---image%1:09:00:: at all but is comprised of realities---reality%1:09:00:: , viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream---stream%1:04:00:: , but within the depths---depth%1:07:00:: of the fourth dimension---fourth_dimension%1:28:00:: .
Dreams---dream%1:09:01:: that display events---event%1:03:00:: of the future---future%1:28:00:: with photographic detail---detail%1:09:00:: call for a theory---theory%1:09:00:: explaining their basic mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: and all its components---component%1:24:00:: , including that weird feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: of deja vu---deja_vu%1:09:00:: , inevitably fantastic though that theory---theory%1:09:00:: must seem .
As in the theory---theory%1:09:00:: of perception---perception%1:09:01:: , established in psycho-physiology---psychophysiology%1:09:00:: , the eye---eye%1:08:00:: is recognized as an integral part---part%1:17:00:: of the brain---brain%1:08:00:: .
But then this theory---theory%1:09:00:: confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image---image%1:09:00:: can possibly be received by the brain---brain%1:08:00:: .
The opening paragraph---paragraph%1:10:00:: of the chapter---chapter%1:10:00:: titled The Theory Of Representative Perception , in the book---book%1:10:00:: Philosophies Of Science by Albert G. Ramsperger---person%1:03:00:: says , `` passed on to the brain---brain%1:08:00:: , and there , by some unexplained process , it causes the mind---mind%1:09:00:: to have a perception---perception%1:09:01:: '' .
But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image---image%1:09:00:: within the brain---brain%1:08:00:: ?
As retinal images---image%1:09:00:: are conceded to be an integral function---function%1:04:00:: of the brain---brain%1:08:00:: it seems logical to suppose that the nerves---nerve%1:08:00:: , between the inner brain---brain%1:08:00:: and the eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , carry the direct drive---drive%1:04:02:: for cooperation---cooperation%1:04:01:: from the various brain---brain%1:08:00:: centers---center%1:08:00:: - rather than to theorize on the transmission---transmission%1:04:01:: of an image---image%1:09:00:: which is already in required location---location%1:03:00:: .
Hereby , the external object---object%1:03:00:: viewed by the eyes---eye%1:08:00:: remains the thing---thing%1:06:00:: that is seen , not the retinal image---image%1:09:00:: , the purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation---cooperation%1:04:01:: by stirring sympathetic impulses---impulse%1:11:00:: in the other sensory centers---center%1:08:00:: , motor---motor%1:06:00:: tensions---tension%1:26:01:: , associated word---word%1:10:00:: symbols---symbol%1:10:00:: , and consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: .
Modern physics---physics%1:09:00:: has developed the theory---theory%1:09:01:: that all matter---matter%1:03:00:: consists of minute waves---wave%1:11:00:: of energy---energy%1:19:00:: .
We know that the number---number%1:23:00:: of radio---radio%1:10:00:: and television---television%1:10:00:: impulses---impulse%1:11:01:: , sound waves---sound_wave%1:11:00:: , ultra-violet---ultraviolet%1:19:00:: rays---ray%1:19:00:: , etc. , that may occupy the very same space---space%1:15:00:: , each solitary upon its own frequency---frequency%1:28:00:: , is infinite .
So we may conceive the coexistence---coexistence%1:26:00:: of the infinite number---number%1:23:00:: of universal , apparently momentary states of matter---state_of_matter%1:26:00:: , successive one after another in consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: , but permanent each on its own basic phase---phase%1:26:00:: of the progressive frequencies---frequency%1:24:00:: .
This theory---theory%1:09:01:: makes it possible for any event---event%1:03:00:: throughout eternity---eternity%1:28:00:: to be continuously available at any moment---moment%1:28:00:: to consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: .
Space---space%1:03:00:: in any form---form%1:07:01:: is completely measured by the three dimensions---dimension%1:09:01:: .
If the fourth dimension---fourth_dimension%1:28:00:: is a physical concept---concept%1:09:00:: and not purely metaphysical , through what medium---medium%1:10:00:: does it extend ?
It is not through space---space%1:03:00:: nor time---time%1:28:04:: that the time machine---time_machine%1:06:00:: most approved by science fiction---science_fiction%1:10:00:: must travel for a visit---visit%1:04:01:: to the permanent prehistoric past , or the ever existent past fantasy---fantasy%1:09:00:: future---future%1:28:00:: .
Three seconds---second%1:28:00:: flat is the usual time---time%1:28:05:: , and the space---space%1:15:00:: is crossed by moderate mileage---mileage%1:07:00:: , while the overwhelming immensity---immensity%1:07:00:: of such journeys---journey%1:04:00:: must be conceived as a static pulsation---pulsation%1:11:00:: through an enormous number---number%1:23:00:: of coexistent frequencies---frequency%1:24:00:: which perpetuate all events---event%1:03:00:: .
The body---body%1:08:00:: , senses---sense%1:09:02:: and brain---brain%1:08:00:: , in common with all matter---matter%1:03:00:: , have their counterpart---counterpart%1:09:00:: on each of a countless number---number%1:23:00:: of frequencies---frequency%1:24:00:: .
The senses---sense%1:09:02:: in each counterpart---counterpart%1:09:00:: bear the impression---impression%1:07:00:: only of phenomena---phenomenon%1:03:00:: that share its own frequency---frequency%1:24:00:: , whereas those upon all other frequencies---frequency%1:24:00:: are invisible , inaudible and intactible to them .
Consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: is the factor---factor%1:11:00:: that provides the progressive continuity---continuity%1:26:00:: to sensory impressions---impression%1:07:00:: .
When consciousness---consciousness%1:09:00:: deserts the sleeping body---body%1:08:00:: and the wakeful world---world%1:09:00:: , it continues in the myriad progressions---progression%1:14:00:: of the ever-present past---past%1:28:00:: and future---future%1:28:00:: , in a life---life%1:09:00:: as vibrant and real as the one left when the body---body%1:08:00:: tired and required sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: .
If the photographically realistic continuity---continuity%1:26:00:: of dreams---dream%1:09:01:: , however bizarre their combinations---combination%1:14:00:: , denies that it is purely a composition---composition%1:04:02:: of the brain---brain%1:08:00:: , it must be compounded from views---view%1:09:02:: of diverse realities---reality%1:09:00:: , although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life---real_life%1:09:00:: .
Dr. H. V. Hilprecht---person%1:03:00:: , Professor---professor%1:18:00:: of Assyrian---assyrian%1:10:00:: at the University of Pennsylvania---group%1:03:00:: , dreamed that a Babylonian---babylonian%1:18:00:: priest---priest%1:18:01:: , associated with the king---king%1:18:00:: Kurigalzu---person%1:03:00:: , ( 1300 B.C. . ) escorted him to the treasure---treasure%1:21:00:: chamber---chamber%1:06:00:: of the temple---temple%1:06:00:: of Bel---location%1:03:00:: , gave him six novel points---point%1:09:01:: of information---information%1:10:00:: about a certain broken relic---relic%1:06:00:: , and corrected an error---error%1:09:00:: in its identification---identification%1:04:00:: .
As a matter of fact , the incorrect classification---classification%1:04:00:: , the result---result%1:11:00:: of many weeks---week%1:28:00:: of labor---labor%1:04:00:: by Dr. Hilprecht---person%1:03:00:: , was about to be published by him the following day---day%1:28:01:: .
Some time---time%1:28:05:: later the missing part---part%1:17:00:: of the relic---relic%1:06:00:: was found and the complete inscription---inscription%1:10:00:: , together with other new evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: , fully corroborated the ancient priest---priest%1:18:01:: 's information---information%1:10:00:: .
Dr. Hilprecht---person%1:03:00:: was uncertain as to the language---language%1:09:00:: used by the ancient priest---priest%1:18:01:: in his dream---dream%1:09:01:: .
He was almost positive it was not Assyrian---assyrian%1:18:00:: nor Cassite---cassite%1:10:00:: , and imagined it must have been German---german%1:10:00:: or English---english%1:10:00:: .
We may conclude that all six points---point%1:09:01:: of information---information%1:10:00:: , ostensibly given by the dream---dream%1:09:01:: priest---priest%1:18:01:: , could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht---person%1:03:00:: 's subconscious reasoning---reasoning%1:09:00:: .
But , in denying any physical reality---reality%1:09:00:: for this dream---dream%1:09:01:: , how could the brain---brain%1:08:00:: possibly compose that realistic , vividly visual continuity---continuity%1:26:00:: uninterrupted by misty fadeout---fadeout%1:11:00:: , violent break---break%1:11:00:: or sudden substitution---substitution%1:11:00:: ?
Which theory---theory%1:09:01:: is more fantastic : 1 .
that the perfect continuity---continuity%1:26:00:: was composed from the job lot---job_lot%1:14:00:: of memory---memory%1:09:01:: impressions---impression%1:09:00:: in the professor---professor%1:18:00:: 's brain---brain%1:08:00:: , or 2 .
that the dream---dream%1:09:01:: was a reality---reality%1:09:00:: on the infinite progressions---progression%1:11:00:: of universal , gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: frequencies---frequency%1:24:00:: , across which the modern professor---professor%1:18:00:: and the priest---priest%1:18:01:: of ancient Nippur---location%1:03:00:: met ?
The degree---degree%1:26:01:: of circumstance---circumstance%1:26:01:: , the ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: of memory---memory%1:09:01:: to forgetfulness---forgetfulness%1:09:00:: , determines whether a dream---dream%1:09:01:: will be a recognized , fulfilled prevision---prevision%1:09:01:: , or the vaguely , effective source---source%1:15:00:: of the weird deja vu---deja_vu%1:09:00:: feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: .
No doubt some experiences---experience%1:11:00:: vanish so completely as to leave no trace---trace%1:10:00:: on the sleeper---sleeper%1:18:00:: 's mind---mind%1:09:01:: .
Probably less than one percent---one_percent%1:23:00:: of our previsions---prevision%1:09:01:: escape final obliteration---obliteration%1:04:00:: before we wake .
When we arrive at the events---event%1:03:00:: concerned in the vanished majority---majority%1:07:00:: , they , of course , cannot impress us as anything familiar .
Nevertheless , there are notably frequent instances---instance%1:11:00:: of deja vu---deja_vu%1:09:00:: , in which our recognition---recognition%1:09:00:: of an entirely novel event---event%1:03:00:: is a feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: of having lived through it before , a feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: which , though vague , withstands the verbal barrage---barrage%1:10:00:: from the most impressive corps---corps%1:14:01:: of psychologists---psychologist%1:18:00:: .
If deja vu---deja_vu%1:09:00:: is an illusion---illusion%1:09:00:: , then peculiarly , it is a most prevalent mental disturbance---mental_disturbance%1:26:00:: affecting even the most level-headed people---people%1:14:00:: .
Chauncey Depew---person%1:03:00:: , one-time runner-up---runner-up%1:18:00:: for the Republican Presidential nomination---nomination%1:04:00:: , was attending a convention---convention%1:14:00:: at Saratoga---location%1:03:00:: , where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt---person%1:03:00:: for Governor---governor%1:18:00:: of New York---new_york%1:15:00:: when he noticed that the temporary chairman---chairman%1:18:01:: was a man---man%1:18:00:: he had never met .
After the preliminary business---business%1:04:01:: affair---affair%1:11:00:: was finished Depew---person%1:03:00:: arose and delivered the convincing speech---speech%1:10:01:: that clinched the nomination---nomination%1:04:00:: for Roosevelt---person%1:03:00:: .
If Depew---person%1:03:00:: had told any academic psychologist---psychologist%1:18:00:: that he had a weird feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: of having lived through that identical convention---convention%1:14:00:: session---session%1:10:00:: at some time---time%1:28:05:: in the past---past%1:28:01:: , he would have been informed that he was a victim---victim%1:18:00:: of deja vu---deja_vu%1:09:00:: .
But the famous orator---orator%1:18:00:: felt more than vague recognition---recognition%1:09:00:: for the scene---scene%1:09:00:: .
One week---week%1:28:00:: before the convention---convention%1:14:00:: , Depew---person%1:03:00:: was seated on the porch---porch%1:06:00:: of a country---country%1:15:01:: home---home%1:06:00:: on the Hudson---hudson%1:17:00:: , gazing at the opposite shore---shore%1:17:00:: .
Muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: weakness---weakness%1:07:00:: is now recognized as an uncommon though serious complication---complication%1:04:00:: of steroid---steroid%1:27:00:: therapy---therapy%1:04:00:: , with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroids---corticosteroid%1:27:00:: in clinical use---use%1:04:00:: .
Although biopsies---biopsy%1:09:00:: have shown structural changes---change%1:24:00:: in some of the reported cases---case%1:11:00:: of steroid---steroid%1:27:00:: induced weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: , this case---case%1:11:00:: provides the only example---example%1:09:00:: known to us in which necropsy---necropsy%1:04:00:: afforded the opportunity---opportunity%1:26:00:: for extensive study---study%1:04:00:: of multiple muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: groups---group%1:03:00:: .
The case---case%1:11:00:: described in this paper---paper%1:10:01:: is that of an older man---man%1:18:00:: who developed disabling muscular weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: while receiving a variety---variety%1:14:01:: of steroids---steroid%1:27:00:: for a refractory anemia---anemia%1:26:00:: .
This patient---patient%1:18:00:: was a 65 - year---year%1:28:01:: old white male accountant---accountant%1:18:00:: who entered the New York Hospital---group%1:03:00:: for his fourth and terminal admission---admission%1:04:00:: on June---june%1:28:00:: 26 , 1959 , because of disabling weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: and general debility---debility%1:26:00:: .
In 1953 the patient---patient%1:18:00:: developed an unexplained anemia---anemia%1:26:00:: for which 15 blood transfusions---blood_transfusion%1:04:00:: were given over a period---period%1:28:00:: of 4 years---year%1:28:01:: .
Splenomegaly---splenomegaly%1:26:00:: was first noted in 1956 , and a sternal marrow---marrow%1:08:00:: biopsy---biopsy%1:09:00:: at that time---time%1:28:06:: showed `` scattered foci---focus%1:26:00:: of fibrosis---fibrosis%1:26:00:: '' suggestive of myelofibrosis---myelofibrosis%1:26:00:: .
No additional transfusions---transfusion%1:04:00:: were necessary after the institution---institution%1:04:00:: of prednisone---prednisone%1:27:00:: in July---july%1:28:00:: , 1957 , in an initial dose---dose%1:06:00:: of 40 mg.---mg%1:23:00:: daily with gradual tapering to 10 mg.---mg%1:23:00:: daily .
This medication---medication%1:06:00:: was continued until February---february%1:28:00:: , 1958 .
In February---february%1:28:00:: , 1958 , the patient---patient%1:18:00:: suffered a myocardial infarction---myocardial_infarction%1:26:00:: complicated by pulmonary edema---edema%1:26:00:: .
Additional findings---finding%1:04:00:: at this time---time%1:11:00:: included cardiomegaly---cardiomegaly%1:26:00:: , peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans---arteriosclerosis_obliterans%1:26:00:: , and cholelithiasis---cholelithiasis%1:26:00:: .
The hemoglobin---hemoglobin%1:27:00:: was 11.6 gm.---gm%1:23:00:: .
Therapy---therapy%1:04:00:: included digitalization---digitalization%1:04:00:: and anticoagulation---anticoagulation%1:04:00:: .
Later , chlorothiazide---chlorothiazide%1:06:00:: and salt---salt%1:13:00:: restriction---restriction%1:04:00:: became necessary to control the edema---edema%1:26:00:: of chronic congestive failure---failure%1:26:00:: .
Because of increasing anemia---anemia%1:26:00:: , triamcinolone---triamcinolone%1:27:00:: , 8 mg.---mg%1:23:00:: daily , was started on Feb.---feb%1:28:00:: 23 , 1958 , and was continued until july---july%1:28:00:: , 1958 .
In september---september%1:28:00:: , 1958 , the patient---patient%1:18:00:: developed generalized weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: and fatigue which was concurrent with exacerbation---exacerbation%1:04:01:: of his anemia---anemia%1:26:00:: ; the hemoglobin---hemoglobin%1:27:00:: was 10.6 gm.---gm%1:23:00:: .
In an attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: to reverse the downhill trend---trend%1:15:02:: by stimulating the bone marrow---bone_marrow%1:08:00:: and controlling any hemolytic component---component%1:06:00:: , triamcinolone---triamcinolone%1:27:00:: , 16 mg.---mg%1:23:00:: daily , was begun on Sept.---sept%1:14:00:: 26 , 1958 , and continued until Feb.---feb%1:28:00:: 18 , 1959 .
At first the patient---patient%1:18:00:: felt stronger , and the hemoglobin---hemoglobin%1:27:00:: rose to 13.8 gm.---gm%1:23:00:: , but on Oct.---oct%1:28:00:: 20 , 1958 , he complained of `` caving in '' in his knees---knee%1:08:00:: .
By Nov.---nov%1:28:00:: 8 , 1958 , weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: , specifically involving the pelvic and thigh---thigh%1:08:00:: musculature---musculature%1:08:00:: , was pronounced , and a common complaint---complaint%1:26:00:: was `` difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: in stepping up on to curbs---curb%1:06:00:: '' .
Prednisone---prednisone%1:27:00:: , 30 mg.---mg%1:23:00:: daily , was substituted for triamcinolone---triamcinolone%1:27:00:: from Nov.---nov%1:28:00:: 22 until Dec.---dec%1:28:00:: 1 , 1958 , without any improvement---improvement%1:26:00:: in the weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: .
Serum---serum%1:08:00:: potassium---potassium%1:27:00:: at this time---time%1:11:00:: was 3.8 mEq.---meq%1:07:00:: per liter---liter%1:23:00:: , and the hemoglobin---hemoglobin%1:27:00:: was 13.9 gm.---gm%1:23:00:: By Dec.---dec%1:28:00:: 1 , 1958 , the weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: in the pelvic and quadriceps---quadriceps%1:08:00:: muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: groups---group%1:03:00:: was appreciably worse , and it became difficult for the patient---patient%1:18:00:: to rise unaided from a sitting---sitting%1:04:00:: or reclining---reclining%1:04:00:: position---position%1:07:01:: .
Triamcinolone---triamcinolone%1:27:00:: , 16 mg.---mg%1:23:00:: daily , was resumed and maintained until Feb.---feb%1:28:00:: 18 , 1959 .
Chlorothiazide---chlorothiazide%1:06:00:: was omitted for a 2 - week---week%1:28:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: , but there was no change---change%1:24:00:: in the muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: .
At this time---time%1:11:00:: a detailed neuromuscular examination---examination%1:04:00:: revealed diffuse muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: atrophy---atrophy%1:26:00:: that was moderate in the hands---hand%1:08:00:: and feet---foot%1:08:01:: , but more marked in the shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: , hips---hip%1:08:02:: , and pelvic girdle---pelvic_girdle%1:08:00:: , with hypoactive deep tendon---tendon%1:08:00:: reflexes---reflex%1:04:00:: .
No fasciculations---fasciculation%1:26:00:: or sensory defects---defect%1:26:01:: were found .
Electromyography---electromyography%1:04:00:: revealed no evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: of lower motor neuron---motor_neuron%1:08:00:: disease---disease%1:26:00:: .
Thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: function---function%1:07:00:: tests yielded normal results---result%1:19:00:: .
The protein---protein%1:27:00:: bound iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: was 6.6 | mg.---mg%1:23:00:: % , and the radioactive iodine---iodine%1:27:00:: uptake---uptake%1:04:00:: over the thyroid gland---thyroid_gland%1:08:00:: was 46 % in 24 hours---hour%1:28:00:: , with a conversion---conversion%1:11:00:: ratio---ratio%1:24:01:: of 12 % .
A Schilling test demonstrated normal absorption---absorption%1:22:00:: of vitamin---vitamin%1:27:00:: * * f .
In February---february%1:28:00:: , 1959 , during the second admission---admission%1:04:00:: to The New York Hospital---group%1:03:00:: , a biopsy---biopsy%1:09:00:: specimen---specimen%1:09:00:: of the left gastrocnemius---gastrocnemius%1:08:00:: showed striking increase---increase%1:04:00:: in the sarcolemmal sheath---sheath%1:08:00:: nuclei---nucleus%1:08:00:: and shrunken muscle fibers---muscle_fiber%1:08:00:: in several sections---section%1:17:00:: .
Serial serum---serum%1:08:00:: potassium---potassium%1:27:00:: levels---level%1:07:00:: remained normal ; the serum---serum%1:08:00:: glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase---glutamic_oxaloacetic_transaminase%1:27:00:: was 10 units---unit%1:23:00:: per ml.---ml%1:23:00:: per min.---min%1:28:00:: .
The clinical impression---impression%1:09:00:: at this time---time%1:11:00:: was either muscular dystrophy---muscular_dystrophy%1:26:00:: or polymyositis---polymyositis%1:26:00:: .
On Feb.---feb%1:28:00:: 12 , 1959 , purified corticotropin---corticotropin%1:08:00:: ( ACTH Gel ) , 20 units---unit%1:23:00:: daily intramuscularly , was started but had to be discontinued 3 weeks---week%1:28:00:: later because of excessive fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: retention---retention%1:04:00:: .
From March---march%1:28:00:: 3 to May---may%1:28:00:: 1 , 1949 , the patient---patient%1:18:00:: was maintained on dexamethasone---dexamethasone%1:27:00:: , 3 to 6 mg.---mg%1:23:00:: daily .
In May---may%1:28:00:: 1959 , prednisone---prednisone%1:27:00:: , 30 mg.---mg%1:23:00:: daily , replaced the dexamethasone---dexamethasone%1:27:00:: .
Muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: did not improve , and the patient---patient%1:18:00:: needed first a cane---cane%1:06:01:: , then crutches---crutch%1:06:00:: .
In spite of normal thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: function---function%1:07:00:: tests , a trial---trial%1:09:00:: of propylthiouracil---propylthiouracil%1:27:00:: , 400 mg.---mg%1:23:00:: daily for one week---week%1:28:00:: , was given but served only to intensify muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: .
Repeated attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: to withdraw steroids---steroid%1:27:00:: entirely were unsuccessful because increased muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: resulted , as well as fever---fever%1:26:00:: , malaise---malaise%1:26:00:: , anorexia---anorexia%1:26:00:: , anxiety---anxiety%1:26:00:: , and an exacerbation---exacerbation%1:04:01:: of the anemia---anemia%1:26:00:: .

The surfaces---surface%1:15:00:: were coarsely and finely granular and punctuated by clear , fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: filled cysts---cyst%1:26:00:: measuring up to 3 cm.---cm%1:23:00:: in diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: .
On the surface---surface%1:15:00:: of the right kidney---kidney%1:08:00:: there were also 2 yellow , firm , friable raised areas---area%1:08:00:: measuring up to 2 cm.---cm%1:23:00:: in diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: .
Microscopically , both kidneys---kidney%1:08:00:: showed many small cortical scars---scar%1:26:00:: in which there was glomerular and interstitial fibrosis---fibrosis%1:26:00:: , tubular atrophy---atrophy%1:26:00:: , and an infiltration---infiltration%1:04:00:: of lymphocytes---lymphocyte%1:08:00:: and plasma---plasma%1:08:00:: cells---cell%1:03:00:: .

Throughout , there were marked arteriolosclerosis---arteriolosclerosis%1:26:00:: and hyalinization---hyalinization%1:26:00:: of afferent glomerular arterioles---arteriole%1:08:00:: .
These changes---change%1:19:00:: were more marked in the atrophic right kidney---kidney%1:08:00:: than in the left .
In addition , there were 2 small papillary adenomas---adenoma%1:26:00:: in the right kidney---kidney%1:08:00:: .
The bone---bone%1:27:00:: of the vertebral bodies---body%1:17:00:: , ribs---rib%1:08:01:: , and sternum---sternum%1:08:00:: was soft and was easily compressed .
The marrow---marrow%1:08:00:: of the vertebral bodies---body%1:17:00:: was pale and showed areas---area%1:08:00:: of fatty replacement---replacement%1:04:00:: .
Microscopically , there were many areas---area%1:08:00:: of hypercellularity---hypercellularity%1:26:00:: alternating with areas---area%1:08:00:: of hypocellularity---hypocellularity%1:26:00:: .
The cells---cell%1:03:00:: of the erythroid , myeloid , and megakaryocytic series---series%1:14:00:: were normal except for their numbers---number%1:23:00:: .
There was no evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: of fibrosis---fibrosis%1:26:00:: .
The muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: of the extremities---extremity%1:08:00:: , chest---chest%1:08:00:: wall---wall%1:17:00:: , neck---neck%1:08:00:: , and abdominal wall---wall%1:17:00:: were soft , pale , and atrophic .
Microscopic studies---study%1:04:00:: of the gastrocnemius---gastrocnemius%1:08:00:: , pectoralis major---pectoralis_major%1:08:00:: , transversus abdominis---transversus_abdominis%1:08:00:: , biceps brachii---biceps_brachii%1:08:00:: , and diaphragm---diaphragm%1:08:00:: showed atrophy---atrophy%1:26:00:: as well as varying degrees---degree%1:26:01:: of injury---injury%1:26:00:: ranging from swelling---swelling%1:26:00:: and vacuolization---vacuolization%1:26:00:: to focal necrosis---necrosis%1:19:00:: of the muscle fibers---muscle_fiber%1:08:00:: .
These changes---change%1:19:00:: were most marked in the gastrocnemius---gastrocnemius%1:08:00:: and biceps---biceps%1:08:00:: and less evident in the pectoralis---pectoralis%1:08:00:: , diaphragm---diaphragm%1:08:00:: , and transversus .
In the gastrocnemius---gastrocnemius%1:08:00:: and biceps---biceps%1:08:00:: there were many swollen and homogeneous necrotic fibers---fiber%1:27:00:: such as that shown in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 .
Such swollen fibers---fiber%1:27:00:: were deeply eosinophilic , contained a few pyknotic nuclei---nucleus%1:08:00:: , and showed loss---loss%1:22:00:: of cross striations---striation%1:25:00:: , obliteration---obliteration%1:04:00:: of myofibrils---myofibril%1:08:00:: , and prominent vacuolization---vacuolization%1:26:00:: .
The necrosis---necrosis%1:19:00:: often involved only a portion---portion%1:24:00:: of the length---length%1:07:00:: of a given fiber---fiber%1:27:00:: , and usually the immediately adjacent fibers---fiber%1:27:00:: were normal .
As shown in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 , the protoplasm---protoplasm%1:08:00:: of other fibers---fiber%1:27:00:: was pale , granular , or flocculated and invaded by phagocytes---phagocyte%1:08:00:: .
Inflammatory cells---cell%1:03:00:: were strikingly absent .
In association with these changes---change%1:24:00:: in the fibers---fiber%1:27:00:: , there were striking alterations---alteration%1:04:01:: in the muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: nuclei---nucleus%1:08:00:: .
These were increased both in number---number%1:23:00:: and in size---size%1:07:00:: , contained prominent nucleoli---nucleolus%1:08:00:: , and were distributed throughout the fiber---fiber%1:27:00:: ( Figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 2 - 5 ) .
In contrast---contrast%1:04:00:: to the nuclear changes---change%1:24:00:: described above , another change---change%1:24:00:: in muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: nuclei---nucleus%1:08:00:: was seen , usually occurring in fibers---fiber%1:27:00:: that were somewhat smaller than normal but that showed distinct cross striations---striation%1:25:00:: and myofibrillae---myofibrilla%1:08:00:: .
The nuclei---nucleus%1:08:00:: of these fibers---fiber%1:27:00:: , as is shown in Figures---figure%1:10:00:: 3 and 4 , showed remarkable proliferation---proliferation%1:22:00:: and were closely approximated , forming a chain---chain%1:06:00:: like structure---structure%1:08:00:: at either the center---center%1:15:00:: or the periphery---periphery%1:25:00:: of the fiber---fiber%1:27:00:: .
Individual nuclei---nucleus%1:08:00:: were usually oval to round , though occasionally elongated , and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic .
At times , clumps---clump%1:14:00:: of 10 to 15 closely packed nuclei---nucleus%1:08:00:: were also observed .
Occasionally there were small basophilic fibers---fiber%1:27:00:: that were devoid of myofibrillae---myofibrilla%1:08:00:: and contained many vesicular nuclei---nucleus%1:08:00:: with prominent nucleoli---nucleolus%1:08:00:: ( Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 5 ) .
These were thought to represent regenerating fibers---fiber%1:27:00:: .
Trichrome stains---stain%1:27:00:: failed to show fibrosis---fibrosis%1:26:00:: in the involved muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: .
In all of the sections---section%1:17:00:: examined , the arterioles---arteriole%1:08:00:: and small arteries---artery%1:08:00:: were essentially normal .
A band---band%1:10:00:: viscometer---viscometer%1:06:00:: is shown in Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 2 .
It consists of two blocks---block%1:06:00:: with flat surfaces---surface%1:06:00:: held apart by shims---shim%1:06:00:: .
There is a small well---well%1:06:03:: in the top---top%1:15:00:: in which the fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: or paste---paste%1:27:01:: to be tested is placed .
A tape---tape%1:06:00:: of cellulose acetate---cellulose_acetate%1:27:00:: is pulled between the blocks---block%1:06:00:: and the tape---tape%1:06:00:: pulls the fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: or paste---paste%1:27:01:: with it between the parallel faces---face%1:06:02:: of the blocks---block%1:06:00:: .
In normal use---use%1:04:00:: weights---weight%1:06:00:: are hung on the end---end%1:15:00:: of the tape---tape%1:06:00:: and allowed to pull the tape---tape%1:06:00:: and the material---material%1:27:00:: to be tested between the blocks---block%1:06:00:: .
After it has reached terminal velocity---terminal_velocity%1:28:00:: , the time---time%1:28:05:: for the tape---tape%1:06:00:: to travel a known distance---distance%1:07:00:: is recorded .
By the use---use%1:04:00:: of various weights---weight%1:06:00:: , data---data%1:14:00:: for a force---force%1:19:00:: rate---rate%1:28:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: graph---graph%1:10:00:: can be obtained .
The instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: used for this work---work%1:04:00:: was a slight modification---modification%1:06:00:: of that previously described .
In this test---test%1:09:02:: a * * f tape---tape%1:06:00:: was pulled between the blocks---block%1:06:00:: with a motor---motor%1:06:00:: and pulley---pulley%1:06:00:: at a rate---rate%1:28:00:: of * * f with a clearance---clearance%1:07:00:: of 0.002 '' on each side---side%1:15:00:: of the tape---tape%1:06:00:: .
This gives a rate---rate%1:28:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: of * * f .
This , however , can only be considered approximate , as the diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: of the pulley---pulley%1:06:00:: was increased by the build-up---buildup%1:04:00:: of tape---tape%1:06:00:: and the tape---tape%1:06:00:: was occasionally removed from the pulley---pulley%1:06:00:: during the runs---run%1:04:06:: .
The face---face%1:06:02:: of one block---block%1:06:00:: contained a hole---hole%1:25:00:: 1 16 '' in diameter---diameter%1:07:00:: which led to a manometer---manometer%1:06:00:: for the measurement of the normal pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: .
Although there were only four fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: tested , it was apparent that there were two distinct types---type%1:09:00:: .
Two---two%1:23:00:: of the fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: showed a high positive normal pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: when undergoing shear---shear%1:19:00:: , and two showed small negative pressures---pressure%1:19:00:: which were negligible in comparison with the amount---amount%1:07:00:: of the positive pressures---pressure%1:19:00:: generated by the other two .
Figure---figure%1:10:00:: 3 shows the data---data%1:14:00:: on a silicone---silicone%1:27:00:: fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: , labeled 12500 cps---cps%1:28:00:: which gave a high positive normal pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: .
Although the tape---tape%1:06:00:: was run for over 1 hr.---hr%1:28:00:: , a steady state---state%1:03:00:: was not reached , and it was concluded that the reason---reason%1:10:01:: for this was that the back pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: of the manometer---manometer%1:06:00:: was built up from the material---material%1:27:00:: fed from between the blocks---block%1:06:00:: and this was available at a very slow rate---rate%1:28:00:: .
A system---system%1:09:01:: had to be used which did not depend upon the feeding---feeding%1:04:00:: of the fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: into the manometer---manometer%1:06:00:: if measurements of the normal pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: were to be made in a reasonable time---time%1:28:05:: .
A back pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: was then introduced , and the rise---rise%1:04:00:: or fall---fall%1:17:00:: of the material---material%1:27:00:: in the manometer---manometer%1:06:00:: indicated which was greater , the normal pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: in the block---block%1:06:00:: or the back pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: .
By this method---method%1:09:00:: it was determined that the normal pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: exerted by a sample---sample%1:09:00:: of polybutene---polybutene%1:27:00:: ( molecular weight---molecular_weight%1:07:00:: reported to be 770 ) was over half---half%1:23:00:: an atmosphere---atmosphere%1:23:00:: .
The actual pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: was not determined because the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: was beyond the upper limit---upper_limit%1:23:00:: of the apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: on hand .
The two fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: which gave the small negative pressures---pressure%1:19:00:: were polybutenes---polybutene%1:27:00:: with molecular weights---molecular_weight%1:07:00:: which were stated to be 520 and 300 .
These are fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more Newtonian because of their lower molecular weight---molecular_weight%1:07:00:: .
The maximum suction---suction%1:19:00:: was 3.25 '' of test fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: measured from the top---top%1:15:00:: of the block---block%1:06:00:: , and steady states---state%1:03:00:: were apparently reached with these fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: .
It is presumed that this negative head---head%1:19:00:: was associated with some geometric factor---factor%1:11:00:: of the assembly---assembly%1:04:01:: , since different readings---reading%1:09:02:: were obtained with the same fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: and the only apparent difference---difference%1:07:00:: was the assembly---assembly%1:04:01:: and disassembly---disassembly%1:04:00:: of the apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: .
This negative pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: is not explained by the velocity---velocity%1:28:00:: head---head%1:19:00:: * * f since this is not sufficient to explain the readings---reading%1:09:02:: by several magnitudes---magnitude%1:24:00:: .
These experiments---experiment%1:09:00:: can be considered exploratory only .
However , they do demonstrate the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of large normal pressures---pressure%1:19:00:: in the presence---presence%1:26:00:: of flat shear---shear%1:19:00:: fields---field%1:19:00:: which were forecast by the theory---theory%1:09:01:: in the first part---part%1:24:00:: of the paper---paper%1:10:01:: .
They also give information---information%1:09:00:: which will aid in the design---design%1:04:00:: of a more satisfactory instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: for the measurement---measurement%1:04:00:: of the normal pressures---pressure%1:19:00:: .
Such an instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: would be useful for the characterization---characterization%1:10:00:: of many commercial materials---material%1:27:00:: as well as theoretical studies---study%1:04:00:: .
The elasticity---elasticity%1:07:00:: as a parameter---parameter%1:09:00:: of fluids---fluid%1:27:00:: which is not subject to simple measurement at present , and it is a parameter---parameter%1:09:00:: which is probably varying in an unknown manner---manner%1:07:02:: with many commercial materials---material%1:27:00:: .
Such an instrument---instrument%1:06:00:: is expected to be especially useful if it could be used to measure the elasticity---elasticity%1:07:00:: of heavy pastes---paste%1:27:01:: such as printing inks---printing_ink%1:27:00:: , paints---paint%1:06:00:: , adhesives---adhesive%1:27:00:: , molten plastics---plastic%1:27:00:: , and bread dough---bread_dough%1:13:00:: , for the elasticity---elasticity%1:07:00:: is related to those various properties---property%1:07:00:: termed `` length---length%1:07:00:: '' , `` shortness---shortness%1:07:03:: '' , `` spinnability---spinnability%1:07:00:: '' , etc. , which are usually judged by subjective methods---method%1:09:00:: at present .
The actual change---change%1:19:00:: * * f caused by a shear field is calculated by multiplying the pressure differential times the volume , just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head .
The actual change---change%1:24:00:: * * f caused by a shear---shear%1:19:00:: field---field%1:19:00:: is calculated by multiplying the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: differential---differential%1:09:00:: times the volume---volume%1:23:00:: , just as it is for any gravitational or osmotic pressure---osmotic_pressure%1:19:00:: head---head%1:19:00:: .
If the volume---volume%1:23:00:: is the molal volume---volume%1:23:00:: , then * * f is obtained on a molal basis---basis%1:09:00:: which is the customary terminology---terminology%1:10:00:: of the chemists---chemist%1:18:00:: .
Although the * * f calculation---calculation%1:04:00:: is obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field---gravitational_field%1:19:00:: and osmotic pressure---osmotic_pressure%1:19:00:: , it is interesting to confirm it by a method---method%1:09:00:: which can be generalized to include related effects---effect%1:19:00:: .
Consider a shear---shear%1:19:00:: field---field%1:19:00:: with a height---height%1:07:00:: of H and a cross-sectional area---area%1:07:00:: of A opposed by a manometer---manometer%1:06:00:: with a height---height%1:07:00:: of h ( referred to the same base---base%1:06:01:: as H ) and a cross-sectional area---area%1:07:00:: of a .
If * * f is the change---change%1:19:00:: per unit volume in Gibbs function caused by the shear field at constant P and T , and |r is the density of the fluid , then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height is * * f .
If * * f is the change---change%1:24:00:: per unit---unit%1:23:00:: volume---volume%1:23:00:: in Gibbs---person%1:03:00:: function---function%1:24:00:: caused by the shear---shear%1:19:00:: field---field%1:19:00:: at constant P and T , and |r is the density---density%1:07:00:: of the fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: , then the total potential energy---potential_energy%1:19:00:: of the system---system%1:27:00:: above the reference---reference%1:10:06:: height---height%1:07:00:: is * * f .
* * f is the work---work%1:19:00:: necessary to fill the manometer---manometer%1:06:00:: column---column%1:06:01:: from the reference---reference%1:10:06:: height---height%1:07:00:: to h .
The total volume---volume%1:23:00:: of the system---system%1:27:00:: above the reference---reference%1:10:06:: height---height%1:07:00:: is * * f , and h can be eliminated to obtain an equation---equation%1:10:00:: for the total potential energy---potential_energy%1:19:00:: of the system---system%1:27:00:: in terms of H .
The minimum total potential energy---potential_energy%1:19:00:: is found by taking the derivative---derivative%1:09:00:: with respect to H and equating to zero .
This gives * * f , which is the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: .
This is interesting for it combines both the thermodynamic concept---concept%1:09:00:: of a minimum Gibbs---person%1:03:00:: function---function%1:24:00:: for equilibrium---equilibrium%1:26:00:: and minimum mechanical potential energy---potential_energy%1:19:00:: for equilibrium---equilibrium%1:26:00:: .
This method---method%1:09:00:: can be extended to include the concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: differences---difference%1:07:00:: caused by shear---shear%1:19:00:: fields---field%1:19:00:: .
The relation---relation%1:03:00:: between osmotic pressure---osmotic_pressure%1:19:00:: and the Gibbs---person%1:03:00:: function---function%1:24:00:: may also be developed in an analogous way---way%1:07:01:: .
In the above development---development%1:22:02:: we have applied the thermodynamics of equilibrium---thermodynamics_of_equilibrium%1:09:00:: ( referred to by some as thermostatics---thermostatics%1:09:00:: ) to the steady state---state%1:03:00:: .
This can be justified thermodynamically in this case---case%1:26:00:: , and this will be done in a separate paper---paper%1:10:01:: which is being prepared .
This has an interesting analogy with the assumption---assumption%1:10:00:: stated by Philippoff---person%1:03:00:: that `` the deformational mechanics---mechanics%1:09:00:: of elastic solids---solid%1:26:00:: can be applied to flowing---flowing%1:11:00:: solutions---solution%1:27:00:: '' .
There is one exception---exception%1:09:00:: to the above statement---statement%1:10:00:: as has been pointed out , and that is that fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: can relax by flowing into fields---field%1:19:00:: of lower rates---rate%1:28:00:: of shear , so the statement---statement%1:10:00:: should be modified by stating that the mechanics---mechanics%1:09:00:: are similar .
If the mechanics---mechanics%1:09:00:: are similar , we can also infer that the thermodynamics---thermodynamics%1:09:00:: will also be similar .
The concept---concept%1:09:00:: of the strain---strain%1:19:00:: energy---energy%1:19:00:: as a Gibbs---person%1:03:00:: function---function%1:24:00:: difference * * f and exerting a force---force%1:19:00:: normal to the shearing face---face%1:06:02:: is compatible with the information---information%1:09:00:: obtained from optical birefringence---birefringence%1:19:00:: studies---study%1:04:00:: of fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: undergoing shear---shear%1:19:00:: .
Essentially these birefringence---birefringence%1:19:00:: studies---study%1:04:00:: show that at low rates---rate%1:28:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: a tension---tension%1:19:00:: is present at 45 ` to the direction---direction%1:24:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: , and as the rate---rate%1:28:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: increases , the direction---direction%1:24:00:: of the maximum tension---tension%1:19:00:: moves asymptotically toward the direction---direction%1:24:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: .
According to Philippoff---person%1:03:00:: , the recoverable shear---shear%1:19:00:: s is given by * * f where |c is the angle of extinction---angle_of_extinction%1:25:00:: .
From this and the force---force%1:19:00:: of deformation---deformation%1:11:00:: it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy---energy%1:19:00:: of deformation---deformation%1:11:00:: which should be equal to the * * f calculated from the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: normal to the shearing face---face%1:06:02:: .
There is another means---means%1:06:00:: which should show the direction---direction%1:24:00:: and relative value---value%1:09:00:: of the stresses---stress%1:19:00:: in viscoelastic fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: that is not mentioned as such in the literature---literature%1:10:00:: , and that is the shape---shape%1:07:00:: of the suspended drops---drop%1:25:00:: of low viscosity---viscosity%1:07:00:: fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: in shear---shear%1:19:00:: fields---field%1:19:00:: .
These droplets---droplet%1:23:00:: are distorted by the normal forces---force%1:19:00:: just as a balloon---balloon%1:06:01:: would be pulled or pressed out of shape---shape%1:07:00:: in one 's hands---hand%1:08:00:: .
These droplets---droplet%1:23:00:: appear to be ellipsoids---ellipsoid%1:25:00:: , and it is mathematically convenient to assume that they are .
If they are not ellipsoids---ellipsoid%1:25:00:: , the conclusions---conclusion%1:09:01:: will be a reasonable approximation---approximation%1:09:00:: .
The direction---direction%1:24:00:: of the tension---tension%1:19:00:: of minimum pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: is , of course , given by the direction---direction%1:24:00:: of the major axis---major_axis%1:09:00:: of the ellipsoids---ellipsoid%1:25:00:: .
Mason---person%1:03:00:: and Taylor---person%1:03:00:: both show that the major axis---major_axis%1:09:00:: of the ellipsoids---ellipsoid%1:25:00:: is at 45 ` at low rates---rate%1:28:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: and that it approaches the direction---direction%1:24:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: with increased rates---rate%1:28:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: .
( Some suspensions---suspension%1:27:00:: break up before they are near to the direction---direction%1:24:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: , and some become asymptotic to it without breakup---breakup%1:11:00:: . )
This is , of course , a similar type---type%1:09:00:: of behavior---behavior%1:07:00:: to that indicated by birefringence---birefringence%1:19:00:: studies---study%1:04:00:: .
The relative forces---force%1:19:00:: can be calculated from the various radii of curvature---radius_of_curvature%1:07:00:: if we assume : ( A ) The surface tension---surface_tension%1:19:00:: is uniform on the surface---surface%1:15:00:: of the drop---drop%1:25:00:: .
( B ) That because of the low viscosity---viscosity%1:07:00:: of the fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: , the internal pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: is the same in all directions---direction%1:24:00:: .
( C ) The kinetic effects---effect%1:19:00:: are negligible .
( D ) Since the shape---shape%1:07:00:: of the drop---drop%1:25:00:: conforms to the force---force%1:19:00:: field---field%1:19:00:: , it does not appreciably affect the distribution---distribution%1:07:00:: of forces---force%1:19:00:: in the fluid---fluid%1:27:02:: .
These are reasonable assumptions---assumption%1:09:00:: with low viscosity---viscosity%1:07:00:: fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: suspended in high viscosity---viscosity%1:07:00:: fluids---fluid%1:27:02:: which are subjected to low rates---rate%1:28:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: .
Just as the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: exerted by surface tension---surface_tension%1:19:00:: in a spherical drop---drop%1:25:00:: is * * f and the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: exerted by surface tension---surface_tension%1:19:00:: on a cylindrical shape---shape%1:07:00:: is * * f , the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: exerted by any curved surface---surface%1:15:00:: is * * f , where |g is the interfacial tension---interfacial_tension%1:19:00:: and * * f and * * f are the two radii of curvature---radius_of_curvature%1:07:00:: .
This formula---formula%1:10:00:: is given by Rumscheidt---person%1:03:00:: and Mason---person%1:03:00:: .
If a is the major axis---major_axis%1:09:00:: of an ellipsoid---ellipsoid%1:25:00:: and b and c are the other two axes---axis%1:09:00:: , the radius of curvature---radius_of_curvature%1:07:00:: in the ab plane---plane%1:25:00:: at the end---end%1:15:00:: of the axis---axis%1:09:00:: is * * f , and the difference in pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: along the a and b axes---axis%1:09:00:: is * * f .
There are no data---data%1:14:00:: published in the literature---literature%1:10:00:: on the shape---shape%1:07:00:: of low viscosity---viscosity%1:07:00:: drops---drop%1:25:00:: to confirm the above formulas---formula%1:10:00:: .
However , there are photographs---photograph%1:06:00:: of suspended drops---drop%1:25:00:: of cyclohexanol phthalate---cyclohexanol_phthalate%1:27:00:: ( viscosity---viscosity%1:07:00:: 155 poises---poise%1:23:00:: ) suspended in corn syrup---corn_syrup%1:13:00:: of 71 poises---poise%1:23:00:: in a paper---paper%1:10:01:: by Mason---person%1:03:00:: and Bartok---person%1:03:00:: .
This viscosity---viscosity%1:07:00:: of the material---material%1:27:00:: in the drops---drop%1:25:00:: is , of course , not negligible .
Measurements on the photograph---photograph%1:06:00:: in this paper---paper%1:10:01:: give * * f at the maximum rate---rate%1:28:00:: of shear---shear%1:19:00:: of * * f .
If it is assumed that the formula---formula%1:10:00:: given by Lodge---person%1:03:00:: of * * f , cosec---cosecant%1:24:00:: 2lc applies , the pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: difference along the major axes---major_axis%1:09:00:: can be calculated from the angle---angle%1:25:00:: of inclination---inclination%1:25:01:: of the major axis---major_axis%1:09:00:: , and from this the interfacial tension---interfacial_tension%1:19:00:: can be calculated .
Its value---value%1:09:00:: was * * f from the above data---data%1:14:00:: .
This appears to be high , as would be expected from the appreciable viscosity---viscosity%1:07:00:: of the material---material%1:27:00:: in the drops---drop%1:25:00:: .
It is appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic properties---property%1:07:00:: of an ideal gas---ideal_gas%1:27:00:: that are analogous to rubber-like deformation---deformation%1:11:00:: .
The internal energy---energy%1:19:00:: of an ideal gas---ideal_gas%1:27:00:: depends on temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: only and is independent of pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: or volume---volume%1:23:00:: .
In other words , if an ideal gas---ideal_gas%1:27:00:: is compressed and kept at constant temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: , the work---work%1:19:00:: done in compressing it is completely converted into heat---heat%1:19:00:: and transferred to the surrounding heat sink---heat_sink%1:06:00:: .
This means that work---work%1:19:00:: equals q which in turn equals * * f .
There is a well-known relationship---relationship%1:24:00:: between probability---probability%1:07:00:: and entropy which states that * * f , where \q is the probability---probability%1:07:00:: that state---state%1:03:00:: ( i.e. , volume---volume%1:23:00:: for an ideal gas---ideal_gas%1:27:00:: ) could be reached by chance---chance%1:19:00:: alone .
This conformational entropy is , in this case---case%1:26:00:: , equal to the usual entropy , for there are no other changes---change%1:24:00:: or other energies---energy%1:19:00:: involved .
Note that though the ideal gas---ideal_gas%1:27:00:: itself contains no additional energy---energy%1:19:00:: , the compressed gas---gas%1:26:00:: does exert an increased pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: .
The energy---energy%1:19:00:: for any isothermal work---work%1:19:00:: done by the perfect gas---perfect_gas%1:27:00:: must come as thermal energy---energy%1:19:00:: from its surroundings---surroundings%1:26:00:: .
The Russian gymnasts---gymnast%1:18:00:: beat the tar out of the American gymnasts---gymnast%1:18:00:: in the 1960 Olympics---olympics%1:11:00:: for one reason---reason%1:10:01:: - they were better .
They were better trained , better looking , better built , better disciplined - and something else - they were better dancers---dancer%1:18:00:: .
Our athletes---athlete%1:18:00:: are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance---dance%1:10:00:: .
The Russians---russian%1:18:00:: are all trained as dancers---dancer%1:18:00:: before they start to study gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: .
But why gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: at all ?
And is the sport---sport%1:04:00:: really important ?
And is the sport---sport%1:04:01:: really important ?
After all , we did pretty well in some other areas---area%1:09:00:: of the Olympics---olympics%1:11:00:: competition---competition%1:11:00:: .
It is more than just lack---lack%1:26:00:: of dance---dance%1:10:00:: training---training%1:04:00:: that is our problem---problem%1:26:00:: , for just as gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: can learn from dance---dance%1:10:00:: , dance---dance%1:10:00:: has some very important things---thing%1:09:01:: to learn from gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: .
Taking first things---thing%1:09:00:: first , let 's understand the sport---sport%1:04:01:: called gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: .
Taking first things first , let 's understand the sport---sport%1:04:00:: called gymnastics .
It is made up of tumbling---tumbling%1:04:00:: , which might be said to start with a somersault---somersault%1:04:00:: , run through such stunts---stunt%1:04:00:: as headstands---headstand%1:04:00:: , handstands---handstand%1:04:00:: , cartwheels---cartwheel%1:04:00:: , backbends---backbend%1:04:00:: , and culminate in nearly impossible combinations---combination%1:14:00:: of aerial flips---flip%1:04:03:: and twists---twist%1:04:02:: and apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: .
The apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: used by gymnasts---gymnast%1:18:00:: was once a common sight---sight%1:10:00:: in American gyms---gym%1:06:00:: , but about 1930 it was in favor of games---game%1:04:00:: .
The parallel bars---parallel_bars%1:06:00:: , horse---horse%1:06:03:: , buck---buck%1:06:01:: , springboard---springboard%1:06:00:: , horizontal bar---horizontal_bar%1:06:00:: , rings , and mats---mat%1:06:02:: formerly in the school---school%1:06:00:: gyms---gym%1:06:00:: were replaced by baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: , volleyball---volleyball%1:04:00:: , basketball---basketball%1:04:00:: and football---football%1:04:00:: .
But the Russians---russian%1:18:00:: use gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: as the first step---first_step%1:04:00:: in training for all other sports---sport%1:04:01:: because it provides training---training%1:04:00:: in every basic quality---quality%1:07:00:: except one , endurance---endurance%1:07:00:: .
But the Russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports---sport%1:04:00:: because it provides training in every basic quality except one , endurance .
The gymnast---gymnast%1:18:00:: must develop strength---strength%1:07:00:: , flexibility---flexibility%1:07:02:: , coordination---coordination%1:09:00:: , timing---timing%1:07:00:: , rhythm---rhythm%1:07:01:: , courage---courage%1:07:00:: , discipline---discipline%1:09:01:: , persistence---persistence%1:07:00:: and the desire---desire%1:12:00:: for perfection---perfection%1:26:00:: .
In short , gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: uses every part---part%1:08:01:: of the body---body%1:08:00:: and requires a great deal---great_deal%1:23:00:: of character---character%1:07:01:: as well .
The addition of endurance---endurance%1:07:00:: training---training%1:04:00:: later , when the body---body%1:08:00:: is mature enough to benefit from it without danger---danger%1:04:00:: of injury---injury%1:11:00:: , provides that final quality---quality%1:07:00:: that makes the top athlete---athlete%1:18:00:: , soldier---soldier%1:18:00:: or citizen---citizen%1:18:00:: .
Another reason---reason%1:10:01:: gymnastic study---study%1:09:03:: is valuable is that it can be started very early in life---life%1:26:02:: .
( An enterprising teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: or parent---parent%1:18:00:: could start training a healthy child---child%1:18:01:: at the age---age%1:07:00:: of seven days---day%1:28:00:: .
Most Europeans---european%1:18:00:: have been exercising newborn infants---infant%1:18:00:: for centuries---century%1:28:00:: . )
In most sports---sport%1:04:00:: , as in most walks of life---walk_of_life%1:04:00:: , the angels---angel%1:18:00:: are on the side---side%1:14:00:: of those who begin young , and the Russian competitor---competitor%1:18:00:: of 16 has at least thirteen years---year%1:28:01:: of training---training%1:04:00:: behind him .
The American---american%1:18:00:: is very lucky if he has three .
If a nation---nation%1:14:00:: wished to get a head start---head_start%1:07:00:: in physical fitness---fitness%1:26:00:: over all other nations---nation%1:14:00:: , it would start its kindergarten---kindergarten%1:14:00:: students---student%1:18:00:: on a program---program%1:09:00:: of gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: the day---day%1:28:01:: they entered and thus eliminate a large number---large_number%1:23:00:: of the problems---problem%1:26:00:: that plague American---american%1:18:00:: schools---school%1:14:00:: .
First of the problems---problem%1:26:00:: attacked would be fatigue---fatigue%1:26:00:: and emotional tension---tension%1:26:03:: , since action---action%1:26:00:: relieves both .
Oddly enough , it is proven that there would be less reading---reading%1:10:00:: difficulty---difficulty%1:07:00:: .
Certainly there would be less anxiety---anxiety%1:12:00:: , fewer accidents---accident%1:11:01:: ( it is the clumsy child---child%1:18:00:: who sustains the worst injuries---injury%1:11:00:: ) , and higher scholastic averages---average%1:09:00:: , since alert children---child%1:18:00:: work better .
Russia---russia%1:15:00:: knows this , and that is why there were over 800000 competing for places---place%1:04:00:: as candidates---candidate%1:18:00:: for the Olympic gymnastic team---team%1:14:00:: .
Eighty thousand won top honors---honor%1:10:00:: and a chance---chance%1:26:00:: to try for the team---team%1:14:00:: itself .
We could scarcely find eighty in our great land---land%1:15:02:: of over 180 million people---people%1:14:00:: .
And what has dancing---dancing%1:04:00:: to do with all this ?
A great deal---great_deal%1:23:00:: .
Russia---russia%1:15:00:: 's young gymnasts---gymnast%1:18:00:: have studied dance---dance%1:10:00:: before having the rigorous training---training%1:04:00:: on apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: .
Well stretched , trained in posture---posture%1:07:01:: and coordinated movement---movement%1:04:00:: , and wedded to rhythm---rhythm%1:07:01:: , they presented the audiences---audience%1:14:00:: in Rome---rome%1:15:00:: with one of the most beautiful sights---sight%1:10:00:: ever seen at any Olympic contest---contest%1:11:00:: .
American---american%1:18:00:: audiences---audience%1:14:01:: in particular---particular%1:09:00:: learned two valuable lessons---lesson%1:10:01:: .
They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men---man%1:18:00:: performing with incredible grace---grace%1:07:01:: .
They were further stripped of old wives' tales---old_wives'_tale%1:09:00:: by seeing the slender , lovely Russian girls---girl%1:18:00:: performing feats---feat%1:04:00:: requiring tremendous strength---strength%1:07:00:: - and with not one bulging muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: .
President Kennedy---person%1:03:00:: has asked that we become a physically fit nation---nation%1:14:00:: .
If we wait until children---child%1:18:00:: are in junior high---junior_high%1:14:00:: or high school---high_school%1:14:00:: , we will never manage it .
To be fit , one has to start early with young children---child%1:18:00:: , and today the only person---person%1:03:00:: who really reaches such children---child%1:18:00:: is the teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: of dance---dance%1:10:00:: .
If the dance---dance%1:10:00:: teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: of America---america%1:15:00:: make it their business---business%1:09:00:: to prepare their young charges---charge%1:18:00:: for the gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: that must come some day if our schools---school%1:14:00:: are really responsible , we will be that much ahead .
School teachers---school_teacher%1:18:00:: , all too unprepared for the job---job%1:04:01:: they must do , will need demonstrators---demonstrator%1:18:02:: .
There should be youngsters---youngster%1:18:00:: who know how to do a headstand---headstand%1:04:00:: , and also how to help other children---child%1:18:00:: learn it .
They should know simple exercises---exercise%1:04:02:: that could prepare less fortunate children---child%1:18:00:: for the sports---sport%1:04:00:: we will demand be taught .
Dance---dance%1:10:00:: teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: can respond to President Kennedy---person%1:03:00:: 's request---request%1:10:00:: not only through their regular dance---dance%1:10:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: , but also through the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of basic gymnastic work---work%1:04:00:: that makes for strength---strength%1:07:00:: and flexibility---flexibility%1:07:02:: .
Very little---little%1:23:00:: in today 's living---living%1:09:00:: provides the strength---strength%1:07:00:: we need , and nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: provides the flexibility---flexibility%1:07:02:: .
Dancers---dancer%1:18:00:: do have flexibility---flexibility%1:07:02:: .
They often fail , however , to develop real abdominal , back---back%1:08:00:: , chest---chest%1:08:00:: , shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: and arm---arm%1:08:00:: strength---strength%1:07:00:: .
Ask any group---group%1:03:00:: of ballerinas---ballerina%1:18:00:: to do ten push-ups---pushup%1:04:00:: or three chin-ups---chin-up%1:04:00:: and the results---result%1:11:00:: , considering the amount---amount%1:09:00:: of physical training---training%1:04:00:: they have had , will be very disappointing .
Even the boys---boy%1:18:00:: will not be outstanding in these areas---area%1:09:00:: .
This is n't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent---percent%1:24:00:: of the 11 - year---year%1:28:01:: old boys---boy%1:18:00:: in America---america%1:15:00:: cannot chin themselves once , and that English school girls---schoolgirl%1:18:00:: outdo them in almost every test---test%1:10:00:: ( even dashes---dash%1:04:01:: and endurance---endurance%1:07:00:: ) .
The only area---area%1:09:00:: in which American boys---boy%1:18:00:: hold their own is the baseball---baseball%1:06:00:: throw---throw%1:04:00:: .
For arm---arm%1:08:00:: and shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: strength---strength%1:07:00:: a chinning bar---chinning_bar%1:06:00:: is recommended .
It should be installed over a door---door%1:06:01:: that is in full view of everyone , and a chair---chair%1:06:00:: should be placed under it , a little to one side---side%1:15:02:: .
Those children---child%1:18:00:: who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin up---chin-up%1:04:00:: each time---time%1:11:00:: they pass under it .
Those who are too weak , should climb on the chair---chair%1:06:00:: and , starting at the top---top%1:15:01:: of the chin---chin%1:08:00:: , let themselves slowly down .
When they can take ten seconds---second%1:28:00:: to accomplish the descent---descent%1:04:00:: , they will have the strength---strength%1:07:00:: to chin up .
Parents---parent%1:18:00:: should be informed about this system---system%1:09:01:: and encouraged to do the same with the whole family---family%1:14:00:: at home---home%1:15:04:: .
Arm---arm%1:08:00:: , shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: , chest---chest%1:08:00:: , upper and lower back---back%1:08:00:: strength---strength%1:07:00:: will be aided with the Horse Kick .
Start on hands---hand%1:08:00:: and feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
Keeping the hands---hand%1:08:00:: in the starting position---position%1:15:00:: , run in place to a quick rhythm---rhythm%1:07:01:: .
After this has become easy , use slower and slower rhythms---rhythm%1:07:01:: , kicking higher and higher .
Follow this by crossing from one corner---corner%1:06:02:: of the room---room%1:06:00:: to the other on all fours , kicking as high as possible .
Push-ups---pushup%1:04:00:: are essential , but few have the strength---strength%1:07:00:: for them at first .
Start on the knees---knee%1:08:00:: in a large circle---circle%1:25:00:: .
Fall slowly forward onto the hands---hand%1:08:00:: and let the body---body%1:08:00:: down to rest on the floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
Do this exercise---exercise%1:04:02:: six---six%1:23:00:: times---time%1:11:00:: each class---class%1:14:03:: period---period%1:28:00:: .
As strength---strength%1:07:00:: improves start in a standing position---position%1:07:01:: with legs---leg%1:08:01:: wide apart and upper body---body%1:08:01:: bent forward .
Start by falling forward to a point---point%1:15:00:: close to the feet---foot%1:08:01:: , and , as strength---strength%1:07:00:: improves , fall farther and farther out .
Try to push back to the stand---stand%1:15:00:: position---position%1:07:01:: from the stretched position---position%1:07:01:: without any intermediate pushes---push%1:04:00:: from the hands---hand%1:08:00:: .
The push-up---pushup%1:04:00:: itself can be taught by starting at the top---top%1:15:01:: of the push-up---pushup%1:04:00:: with legs---leg%1:08:01:: spread wide .
Let the body---body%1:08:00:: down slowly , taking at least five seconds---second%1:28:00:: for the letting down---letting_down%1:04:00:: .
Five of these done daily for about a week---week%1:28:00:: will develop the strength---strength%1:07:00:: for one push-up---pushup%1:04:00:: .
Handstands---handstand%1:04:00:: come after arms---arm%1:08:00:: , chest---chest%1:08:00:: and shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: have developed at least a minimum---minimum%1:23:00:: of strength---strength%1:07:00:: .
Start with the class---class%1:14:03:: standing in a circle---circle%1:25:00:: , with weight---weight%1:07:00:: on the right foot---foot%1:08:01:: and the left extended a little way---way%1:07:02:: into the circle---circle%1:25:00:: .
At first each child---child%1:18:00:: should do a kick up---kick_up%1:04:00:: by himself so that the teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: can determine those ready to work alone , and those who need help---help%1:04:00:: .
Drop both hands---hand%1:08:00:: to the floor---floor%1:06:00:: and at the same time kick the right foot---foot%1:08:01:: up in back .
Return to the standing position---position%1:07:01:: .
Care should be taken to see that the hands---hand%1:08:00:: are placed on the floor---floor%1:06:00:: before the kick---kick%1:04:00:: starts and also that the landing foot---foot%1:08:01:: is brought as close to the hands---hand%1:08:00:: as possible .
This will prevent flat falls---fall%1:04:01:: and toe---toe%1:08:01:: injuries---injury%1:11:00:: .
Bare feet---foot%1:08:01:: are better for such work---work%1:04:00:: than any form---form%1:09:01:: of slipper---slipper%1:06:00:: .
Eventually the class---class%1:14:03:: will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: can catch the leading leg---leg%1:08:01:: .
The child---child%1:18:00:: should then bring both legs---leg%1:08:01:: together overhead , point the toes---toe%1:08:01:: and tighten the seat---seat%1:08:00:: muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: .
Be sure that the landing foot---foot%1:08:01:: is brought close to the hands---hand%1:08:00:: and that only one foot---foot%1:08:01:: lands at a time .
The backbend---backbend%1:04:00:: is of extreme importance---importance%1:07:00:: to any form---form%1:09:01:: of free gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: , and , as with all acrobatics---acrobatics%1:04:00:: , the sooner begun the better the results---result%1:19:00:: .
Have the class---class%1:14:03:: lie supine with knees---knee%1:08:00:: apart and bent .
Place flat palms---palm%1:08:00:: on either side---side%1:15:02:: of the head---head%1:08:00:: a few inches---inch%1:23:00:: away from the ears---ear%1:08:00:: , fingers---finger%1:08:00:: pointing toward the shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: .
Arch the back---back%1:08:00:: upwards to make a bridge---bridge%1:24:00:: .
Be sure the head---head%1:08:00:: drops backward so that the child---child%1:18:00:: looks at the floor---floor%1:06:00:: rather than toward the ceiling---ceiling%1:06:00:: .
As flexibility---flexibility%1:07:02:: improves , the feet---foot%1:08:01:: will move closer to the hands---hand%1:08:00:: and the bridge---bridge%1:24:00:: rise higher .
Later this can be combined with the handstand---handstand%1:04:00:: to provide a walkover---walkover%1:04:01:: .
To further increase back---back%1:08:00:: flexibility---flexibility%1:07:02:: , work on the back circle---back_circle%1:04:00:: .
Have the class---class%1:14:03:: lie prone .
Place the hands---hand%1:08:00:: in front of the chest---chest%1:08:00:: .
Keep the legs---leg%1:08:01:: straight and the toes---toe%1:08:01:: pointed .
Straighten the arms---arm%1:08:00:: slowly , this arches the back---back%1:08:00:: .
At the peak of the arch---arch%1:25:00:: , tip the head---head%1:08:00:: back and bend the knees---knee%1:08:00:: in an effort---effort%1:04:00:: to touch toes---toe%1:08:01:: to head---head%1:08:00:: .
Improvement---improvement%1:26:00:: can be measured by the lessening distance---distance%1:07:00:: between toes---toe%1:08:01:: and head---head%1:08:00:: .
The last essential---essential%1:17:00:: to the beginner---beginner%1:18:00:: 's gymnastic program---program%1:09:00:: is the somersault---somersault%1:04:00:: , or forward roll---roll%1:11:02:: .
This used to be part---part%1:24:00:: of every child---child%1:18:00:: 's bag of tricks---bag_of_tricks%1:09:00:: , but few children---child%1:18:00:: can do it today ; some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright .
For most small children---child%1:18:00:: , learning a forward roll---roll%1:11:02:: is simply a matter---matter%1:09:01:: of copying another child---child%1:18:00:: who can .
After it has been seen , have the child---child%1:18:00:: start on a mat---mat%1:06:00:: on hands---hand%1:08:00:: and knees---knee%1:08:00:: ( a thin , inexpensive mat---mat%1:06:00:: is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ) .
He places the hands---hand%1:08:00:: on either side---side%1:15:02:: of the head---head%1:08:00:: , keeping the chin---chin%1:08:00:: down on the chest---chest%1:08:00:: .
He then pushes his seat---seat%1:08:00:: into the air---air%1:15:00:: and the teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: guides it over .
One or two practice---practice%1:04:02:: runs---run%1:04:06:: should be sufficient for solo---solo%1:04:01:: .
If , however , the child---child%1:18:00:: is weak , overweight , or afraid , more help---help%1:04:00:: will be needed .
When the child---child%1:18:00:: raises his seat---seat%1:08:00:: into the air---air%1:15:00:: , the teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: takes hold under both sides---side%1:15:02:: of the pelvis---pelvis%1:08:00:: ; then no matter what happens , the child---child%1:18:00:: 's performance---performance%1:04:00:: will be controlled .
By lifting the seat---seat%1:08:00:: upwards a little , the weight---weight%1:07:00:: is taken off the neck---neck%1:08:00:: and the back---back%1:08:00:: is kept rounded .
These are beginnings---beginning%1:11:00:: , but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts---stunt%1:04:00:: that can be performed by a strong , flexible body---body%1:08:00:: ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes---extreme%1:07:00:: ) .
Even if gymnastics---gymnastics%1:04:00:: are not the ultimate goal---goal%1:09:00:: , the good tumbler---tumbler%1:18:00:: will be a better dancer---dancer%1:18:00:: , a better athlete---athlete%1:18:00:: , and a human being---human_being%1:05:00:: with a greater margin---margin%1:25:00:: of safety---safety%1:26:00:: in any activity---activity%1:04:00:: .
It is very important for parents---parent%1:18:00:: to understand that early training---training%1:04:00:: is imperative .
And dancing school---dancing_school%1:14:00:: , so helpful in artistic and psychological development---development%1:22:02:: , also contributes to this essential early training---training%1:04:00:: - and can contribute even more .
Where their sharp edges---edge%1:15:00:: seemed restless as sea---sea%1:17:00:: waves---wave%1:11:01:: thrusting themselves upward in angry motion---motion%1:11:00:: , Papa-san---person%1:03:00:: sat glacier---glacier%1:17:00:: like , his smooth solidity---solidity%1:07:02:: , his very immobility---immobility%1:26:00:: defying all the turmoil---turmoil%1:26:00:: about him .
`` Our objective---objective%1:09:00:: '' , the colonel---colonel%1:18:00:: had said that day---day%1:28:03:: of the briefing---briefing%1:10:00:: , `` is Papa-san---person%1:03:00:: '' .
There the objective---objective%1:09:00:: sat , brooding over all .
Gouge , burn , blast , insult it as they would , could anyone really take Papa-san---person%1:03:00:: ?
Between the ponderous hulk---hulk%1:18:00:: and himself , in the valley---valley%1:17:00:: over which Papa-san---person%1:03:00:: reigned , men---man%1:18:00:: had hidden high explosives---high_explosive%1:27:00:: , booby traps---booby_trap%1:06:00:: , and mines---mine%1:06:00:: .
The raped valley---valley%1:17:00:: was a pregnant womb---womb%1:08:00:: awaiting abortion---abortion%1:04:00:: .
On the forward slope---slope%1:17:00:: in front of his own post---post%1:06:01:: stretched two rows---row%1:17:00:: of barbed wire---barbed_wire%1:06:00:: .
At the slope---slope%1:17:00:: 's base---base%1:17:00:: coils---coil%1:06:00:: of concertina---concertina%1:06:01:: stretched out of eye---eye%1:08:00:: range---range%1:15:01:: like a wild tangle---tangle%1:17:00:: of children---child%1:18:00:: 's hoops---hoop%1:06:00:: , stopped simultaneously , weirdly poised as if awaiting the magic---magic%1:09:00:: of the child---child%1:18:00:: 's touch---touch%1:11:00:: to start them all rolling again .
Closer still , regular barricades---barricade%1:06:00:: of barbed wire---barbed_wire%1:06:00:: hung on timber---timber%1:06:00:: supports---support%1:06:01:: .
Was it all vain labor---labor%1:04:00:: ?
Who would clean up the mess---mess%1:26:00:: when the war---war%1:04:00:: was over ?
Smiling at his quixotic thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: , Warren---person%1:03:00:: turned back from the opening---opening%1:17:00:: and lit a cigarette---cigarette%1:06:00:: before sitting down .
Tonight a group---group%1:03:00:: of men---man%1:18:00:: , tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:01:: night---night%1:28:00:: he himself , would go out there somewhere and wait .
If he were to go with White---person%1:03:00:: , he would be out there two days---day%1:28:00:: , not just listening in the dark---dark%1:26:00:: at some point---point%1:15:00:: between here and Papa-san---person%1:03:00:: , but moving ever deeper into enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: land---land%1:15:01:: - behind Papa-san---person%1:03:00:: itself .
He had n't realized that there would be so much time---time%1:28:05:: to think , so many lulls---lull%1:28:00:: .
Somehow he had forgotten what he must have been told , that combat---combat%1:04:00:: was an intermittent activity---activity%1:04:00:: .
Now he knew that the moment---moment%1:28:00:: illuminated by the vision---vision%1:09:03:: on the train---train%1:06:00:: would have to be approached .
It could take place tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:01:: night---night%1:28:00:: , or it might occur months---month%1:28:01:: from now .
There was just too much time---time%1:28:05:: .
Time---time%1:28:05:: to become afraid .
White---person%1:03:00:: 's suggestion---suggestion%1:09:00:: flattered , but he did not like the identity---identity%1:07:00:: .
He did not spill over with hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: for the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: .
Pressing his cigarette---cigarette%1:06:00:: out in the earth---earth%1:27:00:: , Warren---person%1:03:00:: walked to the slit---slit%1:06:00:: and scanned the jagged hills .
He saw no life---life%1:19:00:: , but still stood there for a time---time%1:28:05:: peering at the unlovely hills , his gaze---gaze%1:04:00:: continually returning to Papa-san---person%1:03:00:: .
While most of his beliefs---belief%1:09:00:: were still unsettled , he knew that he did not believe in killing---killing%1:04:00:: .
He had come because he could not live out his life---life%1:28:00:: feeling that he had been a coward---coward%1:18:00:: .
There were ten men---man%1:18:03:: on the patrol---patrol%1:14:00:: which Sergeant Prevot---person%1:03:00:: led out that next night---night%1:28:00:: .
The beaming rok was carrying a thirty caliber machine gun ; another man lugged the tripod and a box---box%1:06:00:: of ammunition .
The beaming rok was carrying a thirty caliber---caliber%1:07:01:: machine gun---machine_gun%1:06:00:: ; another man---man%1:18:00:: lugged the tripod---tripod%1:06:00:: and a box---box%1:23:00:: of ammunition---ammunition%1:06:00:: .
Warren---person%1:03:00:: and White---person%1:03:00:: each carried , in addition to their own weapons---weapon%1:06:00:: and ammo---ammo%1:06:00:: , a box---box%1:23:00:: of ammo---ammo%1:06:00:: for the ROK 's machine gun---machine_gun%1:06:00:: .
Warren and White each carried , in addition to their own weapons and ammo , a box---box%1:06:00:: of ammo for the ROK 's machine gun .
Others carried extra clips---clip%1:06:00:: for the Browning Automatic Rifle , which was in the hands---hands%1:04:00:: of a little Mexican---mexican%1:18:00:: named Martinez---person%1:03:00:: .
Prevot---person%1:03:00:: had briefed the two new men---man%1:18:03:: that afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: .
`` We just sit quiet and wait '' , Prevot---person%1:03:00:: had said .
`` Be sure the man---man%1:18:00:: nearest you is awake .
If Joe---person%1:03:00:: does n't show up , we 'll all be back here at 0600 hours---hour%1:28:01:: .
Then we pull out under our mortar---mortar%1:06:00:: and artillery---artillery%1:06:00:: cover---cover%1:04:01:: , but nobody pulls out until I say so .
We bring back all dead---dead%1:14:00:: and wounded '' .
At 2130 hours---hour%1:28:01:: they had passed through the barbed wire---barbed_wire%1:06:00:: at the point---point%1:15:00:: of departure---departure%1:04:00:: .
Then began the journey---journey%1:04:00:: through their own mine fields---mine_field%1:15:00:: .
Mines---mine%1:06:00:: .
They set bouncing betties---bouncing_betty%1:06:00:: to jump and explode at testicle---testicle%1:08:00:: level---level%1:07:01:: while we more mercifully had them go off at the head---head%1:08:00:: .
Mines---mine%1:06:00:: .
The crude wooden boxes---box%1:06:00:: of the enemy---enemy%1:14:00:: , our nicely turned gray metal---metal%1:27:00:: disks---disk%1:25:00:: .
But theirs defied the detectors---detector%1:06:00:: .
Mines---mine%1:06:00:: .
A foot---foot%1:08:01:: misplaced , a leg---leg%1:08:01:: missing .
Mines---mine%1:06:00:: .
All sizes---size%1:07:01:: : big ones , some wired to set off a whole field---field%1:15:00:: , little ones , hand grenade---hand_grenade%1:06:00:: size---size%1:07:01:: .
Booby traps---booby_trap%1:06:00:: to fill the head---head%1:08:00:: with chunks---chunk%1:14:00:: of metal---metal%1:27:00:: .
Warren---person%1:03:00:: tried to shake off the jumble---jumble%1:26:00:: of his fears---fear%1:12:00:: by looking at---looking_at%1:04:00:: the sky---sky%1:17:00:: .
It was dark---dark%1:26:00:: .
Prevot---person%1:03:00:: had said that the searchlights---searchlight%1:06:00:: would be bounced off the clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: at 2230 hours---hour%1:28:01:: , `` which gives us time---time%1:28:05:: to get settled in position---position%1:04:00:: '' .
Because they were new men---man%1:18:03:: and to be sure that they did n't get lost , Prevot---person%1:03:00:: had placed Warren---person%1:03:00:: and White---person%1:03:00:: in the center---center%1:15:01:: of the patrol---patrol%1:14:00:: as it filed out .
His eyes---eye%1:08:00:: now fixed on White---person%1:03:00:: 's solid figure---figure%1:08:00:: , Warren---person%1:03:00:: could hear behind him the tread---tread%1:04:00:: of another .
He could also hear the stream---stream%1:17:00:: which he had seen from his position---position%1:15:00:: .
They were going to follow it for part---part%1:24:00:: of their journey---journey%1:04:00:: .
`` It 's safe '' , Prevot---person%1:03:00:: had said , `` and it provides cover---cover%1:04:00:: for our noise---noise%1:11:00:: '' .
Soon they were picking their way---way%1:15:00:: along the edge---edge%1:15:00:: of the stream---stream%1:17:00:: which glowed in the night---night%1:28:00:: .
On their right---right%1:15:00:: rose the embankment---embankment%1:06:00:: covered with brush---brush%1:14:00:: and trees---tree%1:20:00:: .
If a branch---branch%1:20:00:: extended out too far , each man---man%1:18:03:: held it back for the next , and if they met a low overhang---overhang%1:06:00:: , each warned the other .
If a branch extended out too far , each man---man%1:18:00:: held it back for the next , and if they met a low overhang , each warned the other .
Thus , stealthily they advanced upstream ; then they turned to the right---right%1:15:00:: , climbed the embankment---embankment%1:06:00:: , and walked into the valley---valley%1:17:00:: again .
There was no cover---cover%1:06:02:: here , only grass---grass%1:20:00:: sighing against pant-legs---pant_leg%1:06:00:: .
And with each sigh---sigh%1:10:00:: , like a whip---whip%1:06:00:: in the hand---hand%1:08:00:: of an expert---expert%1:18:00:: , the grass---grass%1:20:00:: stripped something from Warren---person%1:03:00:: .
The gentle whir---whir%1:11:00:: of each footstep---footstep%1:04:00:: left him more naked than before , until he felt his unprotected flesh---flesh%1:08:02:: tremble , chilled by each new sound---sound%1:11:00:: .
The shapes---shape%1:08:00:: of the men---man%1:18:03:: ahead of him lacked solidity---solidity%1:07:02:: , as if the whip---whip%1:06:00:: had stripped them of their very flesh---flesh%1:08:02:: .
The shapes of the men---man%1:18:00:: ahead of him lacked solidity , as if the whip had stripped them of their very flesh .
The dark forms---form%1:08:00:: moved like mourners---mourner%1:18:00:: on some nocturnal pilgrimage---pilgrimage%1:04:00:: , their dirge---dirge%1:10:00:: unsung for want---want%1:26:01:: of vocal chords---vocal_cord%1:08:00:: .
The warped , broken trees---tree%1:20:00:: in the valley---valley%1:17:00:: assumed wraith-like shapes---shape%1:07:01:: .
Clumps---clump%1:14:00:: of brush---brush%1:14:00:: that they passed were so many enchained demons---demon%1:18:00:: straining in anger---anger%1:26:00:: to tear and gnaw on his bones---bone%1:08:00:: .
Looming over all , Papa-san---person%1:03:00:: leered down at him , threatening a hundred hidden malevolencies---malevolency%1:07:00:: .
Off in the distance---distance%1:07:00:: a searchlight---searchlight%1:06:00:: flashed on , its beam---beam%1:19:00:: slashing the sky---sky%1:17:00:: .
The sharp ray---ray%1:19:00:: was absorbed by a cloud---cloud%1:17:00:: , then reflected to the earth---earth%1:17:01:: in a softer , diffused radiance---radiance%1:19:00:: .
Somewhere over there another patrol---patrol%1:14:00:: had need---need%1:26:00:: of light---light%1:19:00:: .
Warren---person%1:03:00:: thought of all the men---man%1:18:03:: out that night---night%1:28:00:: who , like himself , had left their protective ridge---ridge%1:17:00:: and - fear---fear%1:12:00:: working at their guts---guts%1:07:00:: - picked their way---way%1:15:00:: into the area---area%1:15:01:: beyond .
From the east---east%1:24:00:: to the west coast---coast%1:17:00:: of the Korean peninsula---location%1:03:00:: was a strip---strip%1:17:00:: of land---land%1:17:00:: in which fear---fear%1:12:00:: filled men---man%1:18:00:: were at that same moment---moment%1:28:00:: furtively crawling through the night---night%1:28:00:: , sitting in sweaty anticipation---anticipation%1:09:01:: of any movement---movement%1:11:00:: or sound---sound%1:11:00:: , or shouting amidst confused rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: flashes---flash%1:11:00:: and muzzle---muzzle%1:06:01:: blasts .
White---person%1:03:00:: 's arm---arm%1:08:00:: went up and Warren---person%1:03:00:: raised his own .
The patrol---patrol%1:14:00:: was stopping .
Prevot---person%1:03:00:: came up `` Take that spot---spot%1:15:01:: over there '' , he whispered , pointing to a small clump---clump%1:14:00:: of blackness---blackness%1:07:00:: .
`` Give me your machine gun---machine_gun%1:06:00:: ammo---ammo%1:06:00:: '' .
Warren---person%1:03:00:: handed him the metal box---box%1:06:00:: and Prevot---person%1:03:00:: quietly disappeared down the line---line%1:14:03:: .
Lying in the grass---grass%1:20:00:: behind the brush---brush%1:14:00:: clump---clump%1:14:00:: , Warren---person%1:03:00:: looked about .
The others likewise had hidden themselves in the grass---grass%1:20:00:: and the brush---brush%1:14:00:: .
Over his shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: he could see Prevot---person%1:03:00:: with the machine gun---machine_gun%1:06:00:: crew---crew%1:14:00:: .
Even at this short distance---distance%1:07:00:: they were only vague shapes---shape%1:08:00:: , setting up the machine gun---machine_gun%1:06:00:: on a small knoll---knoll%1:17:00:: so that it could fire above the heads---head%1:08:00:: of the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of the patrol---patrol%1:14:00:: .
Warren---person%1:03:00:: eased his rifle---rifle%1:06:00:: 's safety---safety%1:06:00:: off and gently , slowly sneaked another clip---clip%1:06:00:: of ammunition---ammunition%1:06:00:: from one of the cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: bandoleers---bandoleer%1:06:00:: that marked the upper part---part%1:24:00:: of his body---body%1:08:00:: with an X .
This he placed within quick reach---reach%1:04:00:: .
The walk---walk%1:04:00:: and his fears---fear%1:12:00:: had served to overheat him and his sweaty armpits---armpit%1:08:00:: cooled at the touch---touch%1:11:00:: of the night---night%1:28:00:: air---air%1:27:00:: .
Although the armored vest---vest%1:06:01:: fitted the upper part---part%1:24:00:: of his body---body%1:08:00:: snugly , he felt no security---security%1:26:00:: .
Figures---figure%1:08:00:: seemed to crouch in the surrounding dark---dark%1:26:00:: ; in the distance---distance%1:07:00:: he saw a band---band%1:14:01:: of men---man%1:18:00:: who seemed to advance and retreat even as he watched .
Certain this menace---menace%1:26:00:: was only imaginary , he yet stared in fascinated horror---horror%1:12:01:: , his hand---hand%1:08:00:: sticky against the stock---stock%1:06:02:: of his weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: .
He was aware of insistent inner beatings---beating%1:04:01:: , as if prisoners---prisoner%1:18:00:: within sought release---release%1:04:01:: from his rigid body---body%1:08:00:: .
Above , the glowing ivory---ivory%1:07:00:: baton---baton%1:06:00:: of their searchlight---searchlight%1:06:00:: pointed at the clouds---cloud%1:17:00:: , diluting the valley---valley%1:17:00:: 's dark---dark%1:26:00:: to a pallid light---light%1:07:01:: .
Then the figures---figure%1:25:00:: which held his attention---attention%1:09:00:: became a group---group%1:03:00:: of shattered trees---tree%1:20:00:: , standing like the grotesques---grotesque%1:06:00:: of a medieval damnation---damnation%1:10:00:: scene---scene%1:11:00:: .
Even so , he could not ease the tension---tension%1:26:01:: of his body---body%1:08:00:: ; the rough surface---surface%1:17:00:: of the earth---earth%1:17:01:: itself seemed to resist every attempt---attempt%1:04:00:: on his part---part%1:09:02:: to relax .
Sensing the unseen presence---presence%1:26:00:: of the other men---man%1:18:03:: in the patrol---patrol%1:14:00:: , he felt mutely united to these nine near strangers---stranger%1:18:00:: sharing this pinpoint---pinpoint%1:28:00:: of being---being%1:26:00:: with him .
He sensed something precious in the perilous moment---moment%1:28:00:: , something akin to the knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: gained on his bicycle---bicycle%1:06:00:: trip---trip%1:04:00:: through the French countryside---countryside%1:15:00:: , a knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: imprisoned in speechlessness---speechlessness%1:07:00:: .
In France---location%1:03:00:: he had puzzled the meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: of the great stone---stone%1:27:00:: monuments---monument%1:06:00:: men---man%1:18:00:: had thrown up to the sky---sky%1:17:00:: , and always as he wandered , he felt a stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: to their exultation---exultation%1:12:00:: .
They were poems---poem%1:10:00:: in a strange language---language%1:10:00:: , of which he could barely touch a meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: - enough to make his being---being%1:03:00:: ache with the desire---desire%1:12:00:: for the fullness---fullness%1:26:01:: he sensed there .
Brittany---location%1:03:00:: , that stone-gray mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: through which he traveled for thirty days---day%1:28:00:: , sleeping in the barns---barn%1:06:00:: of farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: or alongside roads---road%1:06:00:: , had worked some subtle change---change%1:24:00:: in him , he knew , and it was in Brittany---location%1:03:00:: that he had met Pierre---person%1:03:00:: .
Pierre---person%1:03:00:: had no hands---hand%1:08:00:: ; they had been severed at the wrists---wrist%1:08:00:: .
With leather---leather%1:27:00:: cups---cup%1:25:00:: fitted in his handlebars---handlebar%1:06:00:: , he steered his bicycle---bicycle%1:06:00:: .
He and Warren---person%1:03:00:: had traveled together for four days---day%1:28:00:: .
They visited the shipyards---shipyard%1:06:00:: at Brest---location%1:03:00:: and Pierre---person%1:03:00:: had to sign the register---register%1:10:00:: , vouching for the integrity---integrity%1:07:00:: of the visiting foreigner---foreigner%1:18:00:: .
He took the pen---pen%1:06:00:: in his stumps---stump%1:08:00:: and began to write .
Wait '' ! cried the guard---guard%1:18:03:: who ran from the hut---hut%1:06:00:: to shout to other men---man%1:18:00:: standing about outside .
They crowded the small room---room%1:06:00:: and peered over one another 's shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: to watch the handless man---man%1:18:00:: write his name---name%1:10:00:: in the book---book%1:06:00:: .
And then the questions---question%1:10:00:: came , eager , interested questions---question%1:10:00:: , and many compliments---compliment%1:10:00:: on his having overcome his infirmity---infirmity%1:26:00:: .
`` Does n't it ever bother you '' , Warren---person%1:03:00:: had asked , `` to have people---people%1:14:00:: always asking you about your hands---hand%1:08:00:: '' ?
`` Oh , the French are a very curious people---people%1:14:00:: '' , Pierre---person%1:03:00:: had laughed .
`` They are also honest seekers---seeker%1:18:00:: after truth---truth%1:26:00:: .
Now the English---person%1:03:00:: are painfully silent about my missing hands---hand%1:08:00:: .
The Americans---person%1:03:00:: , like yourself , take the fact---fact%1:09:01:: for granted , try to be helpful , but do n't ask questions---question%1:10:00:: .
I'm used to all three , but I think the French have the healthiest attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: '' .
That was the day---day%1:28:03:: that Pierre---person%1:03:00:: had told Warren---person%1:03:00:: about the Abbey of Solesmes---group%1:03:00:: .
`` You are looking tired and there you can rest---rest%1:28:00:: .
I think , too '' , he said , his dark eyes---eye%1:08:00:: mischievous , `` that you will find there some clue---clue%1:10:00:: to the secret---secret%1:10:00:: of the cathedrals---cathedral%1:06:00:: about which you have spoken '' .
Within two weeks---two_weeks%1:28:00:: Warren---person%1:03:00:: was ringing the bell---bell%1:06:00:: at the abbey---abbey%1:06:02:: gate---gate%1:06:00:: .
The monk---monk%1:18:00:: who opened the door---door%1:06:00:: immediately calmed his worries---worry%1:09:00:: about his reception---reception%1:10:01:: : `` I speak English---english%1:10:00:: '' , the old man---old_man%1:18:02:: said , `` but I do not hear it very well '' .
He smiled and stuck a large finger---finger%1:08:00:: with white hairs---hair%1:08:00:: sprouting on it into his ear---ear%1:08:00:: as though that might help .
Smiling at Warren---person%1:03:00:: 's protestations---protestation%1:10:01:: , the old monk---monk%1:18:00:: took his grip---grip%1:06:00:: from him and led him down a corridor---corridor%1:06:00:: to a small parlor---parlor%1:06:00:: .
In attempting to improve specificity---specificity%1:07:02:: of staining---staining%1:04:00:: , the fluorescein---fluorescein%1:27:00:: labeled antisera---antiserum%1:08:00:: used in both direct and indirect methods---method%1:09:00:: were treated in one of several ways---way%1:07:01:: : ( 1 ) They were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated with acetone---acetone%1:27:00:: insoluble powders---powder%1:27:00:: ( Coons---person%1:03:00:: , 1958 ) prepared from mouse---mouse%1:05:00:: liver---liver%1:08:00:: or from healthy sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: stems---stem%1:20:00:: or crown gall---crown_gall%1:26:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: produced by Agrobacterium tumefaciens---agrobacterium_tumefaciens%1:05:00:: ( E. F. Smith---person%1:03:00:: + Townsend---person%1:03:00:: ) Conn---location%1:03:00:: , on sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: stems---stem%1:20:00:: .
( 2 ) The conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: as well as the intermediate sera---serum%1:08:00:: were absorbed for 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: with 20 - 50 mg---mg%1:23:00:: of proteins---protein%1:27:00:: extracted from healthy sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: stems---stem%1:20:00:: .
The proteins---protein%1:27:00:: were extracted with 3 volumes---volume%1:23:01:: of * * f in * * f to give a nearly neutral extract---extract%1:27:00:: and precipitated by 80 % saturation---saturation%1:04:00:: with * * f .
The precipitate---precipitate%1:27:00:: was washed twice with an 80 % saturated solution---solution%1:27:00:: of * * f , dissolved in a small quantity---quantity%1:03:00:: of 0.1 M---m%1:07:00:: neutral phosphate---phosphate%1:27:00:: buffer---buffer%1:27:00:: , dialyzed against cold distilled water---distilled_water%1:27:00:: till free from ammonium ions---ammonium_ion%1:27:00:: , and lyophilized using liquid nitrogen---liquid_nitrogen%1:27:00:: .
( 3 ) In other experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: the indirect conjugate---conjugate%1:27:00:: was treated with 3 volumes---volume%1:23:01:: of ethyl acetate---ethyl_acetate%1:27:00:: as recommended by Dineen---person%1:03:00:: and Ade---person%1:03:00:: ( 1957 ) .
( 4 ) The conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: were passed through a diethylaminoethyl---diethylaminoethyl_cellulose%1:27:00:: ( DEAE - ) cellulose---cellulose%1:27:00:: column---column%1:06:02:: equilibrated with neutral phosphate---phosphate%1:27:00:: buffer---buffer%1:27:00:: ( PBS---pbs%1:27:00:: ) containing * * f potassium---potassium%1:27:00:: phosphate---phosphate%1:27:00:: and * * f .
The technique---technique%1:09:00:: of cutting---cutting%1:04:01:: sections---section%1:17:00:: was essentially the same as that described by Coons---person%1:03:00:: et al. ( 1951 ) .
Root---root%1:20:00:: and stem---stem%1:20:00:: tumors---tumor%1:26:00:: from sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: plants---plant%1:03:00:: infected with WTV were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen---liquid_nitrogen%1:27:00:: , embedded in ice---ice%1:27:00:: , and cut at 3 - 6 | m---m%1:23:00:: in a cryostat---cryostat%1:06:00:: maintained at - 16 ` to - 20 ` .
The sections---section%1:17:00:: were mounted on cold slides---slide%1:06:02:: smeared with Haupts---person%1:03:00:: ' adhesive---adhesive%1:27:00:: ( Johansen---person%1:03:00:: , 1940 ) in earlier experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: , and in later experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: with a different mixture---mixture%1:14:00:: of the same components---component%1:24:00:: reported by Schramm---person%1:03:00:: and Rottger---person%1:03:00:: ( 1959 ) .
The latter adhesive---adhesive%1:27:00:: was found to be much more satisfactory .
The sections---section%1:17:00:: were then thawed by placing a finger---finger%1:08:00:: under the slide---slide%1:06:02:: and dried under a fan---fan%1:06:00:: for 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: ; until used they were stored for as long as 2 weeks---week%1:28:00:: .
The sections---section%1:17:00:: were fixed in acetone---acetone%1:27:00:: for 15 minutes---15_minutes%1:28:00:: and dried at 37 ` for 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: .
Some of them were then covered with a drop---drop%1:23:00:: of * * f in a moist chamber---chamber%1:06:00:: at 24 ` for 30 - 40 minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
As controls---control%1:09:02:: other sections---section%1:17:00:: were similarly covered with NS .
Sections---section%1:06:00:: were then washed with PBS---pbs%1:27:00:: for 15 - 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: .
After blotting out most of the saline---saline%1:27:00:: around the sections---section%1:17:00:: , a drop---drop%1:23:00:: of * * f was layered over each of the sections---section%1:17:00:: , allowed to react for 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: , and then washed with PBS---pbs%1:27:00:: for 15 - 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: .
After blotting out most of the liquid---liquid%1:27:04:: around the sections---section%1:17:00:: , the latter were mounted in buffered glycerine---glycerine%1:27:00:: ( 7 parts---part%1:06:00:: glycerine---glycerine%1:27:00:: to 3 parts---part%1:06:00:: of PBS---pbs%1:27:00:: ) .
After drying the sections---section%1:17:00:: under the fan---fan%1:06:00:: , fixing in acetone---acetone%1:27:00:: , and drying at 37 ` as in the indirect method---method%1:09:00:: , the sections---section%1:17:00:: were treated with conjugated * * f or * * f ( undiluted unless mentioned otherwise ) for 5 - 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: .
As controls---control%1:09:02:: , other sections---section%1:17:00:: were similarly treated with * * f or conjugated antiserum---antiserum%1:08:00:: to the New York---location%1:03:00:: strain---strain%1:14:00:: of potato yellow-dwarf virus---potato_yellow-dwarf_virus%1:05:00:: ( Wolcyrz---person%1:03:00:: and Black---person%1:03:00:: , 1956 ) .
The sections---section%1:17:00:: were then washed with PBS---pbs%1:27:00:: for 15 - 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: and mounted in buffered glycerine---glycerine%1:27:00:: .
Stained or unstained sections---section%1:17:00:: were examined under dark field illumination---dark_field_illumination%1:04:00:: in a Zeiss fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: microscope---microscope%1:06:00:: equipped with a mercury---mercury%1:27:00:: vapor---vapor%1:27:01:: lamp---lamp%1:06:00:: ( Osram HBO 200 ) .
The light beam---light_beam%1:19:00:: from the lamp---lamp%1:06:00:: was filtered through a half standard thickness---thickness%1:07:01:: Corning 1840 filter---filter%1:06:00:: .
In the eyepiece---eyepiece%1:06:00:: a Wratten 2 B filter---filter%1:06:00:: was used to filter off residual ultra-violet light---ultraviolet_light%1:19:00:: .
A red filter , Zeiss barrier---barrier%1:06:00:: filter with the code---code%1:10:00:: ( Schott ) designation BG 23 , was also used in the ocular lens---lens%1:06:00:: assembly---assembly%1:06:00:: as it improved the contrast---contrast%1:09:00:: between specific and nonspecific fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: .
In the first few experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: * * f was passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and absorbed twice with 50 - 100 mg---mg%1:23:00:: sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: powder---powder%1:27:00:: .
The intermediate sera---serum%1:08:00:: were also similarly absorbed with tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: powder---powder%1:27:00:: .
Sections---section%1:06:00:: of sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: stem---stem%1:20:00:: and root---root%1:20:00:: tumors---tumor%1:26:00:: were treated with 1 : 10 solution---solution%1:27:00:: of * * f for 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: , washed in buffered saline---saline%1:27:00:: for 15 minutes---15_minutes%1:28:00:: , stained with * * f for 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: , and washed for 15 minutes---15_minutes%1:28:00:: in PBS---pbs%1:27:00:: .
Such sections---section%1:17:00:: showed bright yellow-green specific fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: in the cells---cell%1:03:00:: of the pseudophloem---pseudophloem%1:20:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: ( Lee---person%1:03:00:: and Black---person%1:03:00:: , 1955 ) .
This specific fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: was readily distinguished from the light green nonspecific fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: in consecutive sections---section%1:17:00:: stained with 1 : 10 dilution---dilution%1:27:00:: of NS and * * f or with * * f alone .
Unstained sections---section%1:17:00:: mounted in buffered glycerine---glycerine%1:27:00:: or sections---section%1:17:00:: treated only with NS or * * f did not show such green fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: .
Sections---section%1:06:00:: of crown gall---crown_gall%1:26:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: similarly stained with either * * f and * * f or NS and * * f also showed only the light green nonspecific fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: .
However , the nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:00:: by the * * f in tumor---tumor%1:26:00:: sections---section%1:17:00:: was considered bright enough to be confused with the staining---staining%1:04:00:: of small amounts---amount%1:07:00:: of WTV antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: .
Two absorptions---absorption%1:22:00:: of * * f with ethyl acetate---ethyl_acetate%1:27:00:: or two absorptions---absorption%1:22:00:: of * * f ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) , NS and * * f with crown gall---crown_gall%1:26:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: powder---powder%1:27:00:: , or mouse---mouse%1:05:00:: liver---liver%1:08:00:: powder---powder%1:27:00:: did not further improve the specificity---specificity%1:07:01:: of staining---staining%1:04:00:: .
Treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: of all the sera---serum%1:08:00:: with sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: proteins---protein%1:27:00:: greatly reduced nonspecific fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: , especially when the treated conjugate---conjugate%1:27:00:: was diluted to 1 : 2 with 0.85 % saline---saline%1:27:00:: .
In all the above procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: , when the intermediate sera---serum%1:08:00:: were diluted to 1 : 10 or 1 : 100 with 0.85 % saline---saline%1:27:00:: , the specific and nonspecific fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: were not appreciably reduced , whereas , a dilution---dilution%1:27:00:: of the intermediate sera---serum%1:08:00:: to 1 : 500 or diluting the * * f to 1 : 5 greatly reduced specific fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: .
Rinsing the sections---section%1:17:00:: with PBS---pbs%1:27:00:: before layering the intermediate sera---serum%1:08:00:: did not improve the staining---staining%1:04:00:: reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: .
In addition to other treatments---treatment%1:04:01:: , treating the sections---section%1:17:00:: with normal sheep---sheep%1:05:00:: serum---serum%1:08:00:: for half an hour---hour%1:28:00:: before layering * * f did not reduce nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:00:: .
The only treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: by which nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:00:: could be satisfactorily removed was by passing the conjugate---conjugate%1:27:00:: through a DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: column---column%1:06:02:: .
When 1 ml---ml%1:23:00:: of conjugate---conjugate%1:27:00:: was passed through a column---column%1:06:02:: ( * * f ) , the first and second milliliter---milliliter%1:23:00:: fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: collected were the most specific and gave no nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:00:: in some experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: , and very little in others .
In the latter cases---case%1:11:00:: an additional treatment of the DEAE cellulose treated * * f with 50 mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder further improved the specificity .
In the latter cases---case%1:26:00:: an additional treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: of the DEAE cellulose---cellulose%1:27:00:: treated * * f with 50 mg---mg%1:23:00:: of sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: stem---stem%1:20:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: powder---powder%1:27:00:: further improved the specificity---specificity%1:07:01:: .
After these treatments---treatment%1:04:01:: the conjugate---conjugate%1:27:00:: did not stain healthy or crown gall---crown_gall%1:26:00:: sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: tissues---tissue%1:08:00:: or stained them a very faint green which was easily distinguishable from the bright yellow-green specific staining---staining%1:04:00:: .
With this purified conjugate---conjugate%1:27:00:: the best staining---staining%1:04:00:: procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: consisted of treating the sections---section%1:17:00:: with 1 : 10 dilution---dilution%1:27:00:: of * * f for 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: , washing with PBS---pbs%1:27:00:: for 15 minutes---15_minutes%1:28:00:: , staining with * * f for 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: , and washing with PBS---pbs%1:27:00:: for 15 minutes---15_minutes%1:28:00:: .
The specificity---specificity%1:07:01:: of staining---staining%1:04:00:: in WTV tumors---tumor%1:26:00:: with * * f and * * f but not with NS and * * f or with antiserum---antiserum%1:08:00:: to potato yellow-dwarf virus---potato_yellow-dwarf_virus%1:05:00:: and * * f , and the absence---absence%1:26:00:: of such staining---staining%1:04:00:: in crown gall---crown_gall%1:26:00:: tumor---tumor%1:26:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: from sweet-clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: , indicate that an antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: of WTV was being stained .
* * f was first conjugated with 50 mg---mg%1:23:00:: of FITC per gram---gram%1:23:00:: of globulin---globulin%1:27:00:: .
This conjugate---conjugate%1:27:00:: was passed twice through Dowex-2-chloride and treated with various tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: powders---powder%1:27:00:: in the same manner---manner%1:07:02:: as described for the indirect method---method%1:09:00:: .
In all cases---case%1:11:00:: a disturbing amount---amount%1:07:00:: of nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:00:: was still present although it was still distinguishable from specific fluorescence---fluorescence%1:19:00:: .
In later experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: , * * f and * * f were prepared by conjugating 8 mg---mg%1:23:00:: of FITC per gram---gram%1:23:00:: of globulin---globulin%1:27:00:: .
These conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: * * f had much less nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:00:: than the previous conjugate---conjugate%1:27:00:: ( with 50 mg---mg%1:23:00:: FITC per gram---gram%1:23:00:: of globulin---globulin%1:27:00:: ) while the specific staining---staining%1:04:00:: was similar in both cases---case%1:11:00:: .
Nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:00:: could be satisfactorily eliminated by passing these conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: through a DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: column---column%1:06:02:: as described for * * f .
The best staining---staining%1:04:00:: procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: with this purified * * f consisted of staining with the conjugate---conjugate%1:27:00:: for 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: and washing in PBS---pbs%1:27:00:: for 15 minutes---15_minutes%1:28:00:: .
The specificity---specificity%1:07:01:: of staining---staining%1:04:00:: with * * f was established as follows : * * f specifically stained tumor---tumor%1:26:00:: sections---section%1:17:00:: but not sections---section%1:17:00:: of healthy sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: stems---stem%1:20:00:: or of crown gall---crown_gall%1:26:00:: tumor---tumor%1:26:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: from sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: .
Sections---section%1:06:00:: of tumors---tumor%1:26:00:: incited by WTV were not similarly stained with conjugated normal serum---serum%1:08:00:: or conjugated antiserum---antiserum%1:08:00:: to potato yellow-dwarf virus---potato_yellow-dwarf_virus%1:05:00:: .
After passing * * f through DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: , the titer---titer%1:07:00:: of antibodies---antibody%1:27:00:: to WTV in the specific fraction---fraction%1:27:00:: was 1 : 4 of the titer---titer%1:07:00:: before such passage---passage%1:04:00:: ( precipitin---precipitin%1:27:00:: ring---ring%1:25:00:: tests---test%1:09:02:: by R. F. Whitcomb---person%1:03:00:: ) ; but mere dilution---dilution%1:04:00:: of the conjugate---conjugate%1:27:00:: to 1 : 4 did not satisfactorily remove nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:00:: .
This indicates that increase---increase%1:22:00:: in specificity---specificity%1:07:01:: of * * f after passing it through DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: was not merely due to dilution---dilution%1:04:00:: .
Specific staining---staining%1:04:00:: by DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: treated * * f and * * f , although clearly distinguishable under the microscope---microscope%1:06:00:: from either nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:00:: or autofluorescence---autofluorescence%1:19:00:: of cells---cell%1:03:00:: , was not satisfactorily photographed to show such differences---difference%1:07:00:: in spite of many attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: with black and white and color photography---photography%1:04:00:: .
This was chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence---autofluorescence%1:19:00:: from the cells---cell%1:03:00:: .
The autofluorescence---autofluorescence%1:19:00:: from the walls---wall%1:06:00:: of the xylem---xylem%1:20:00:: cells---cell%1:03:00:: was particularly brilliant .
Results---result%1:19:00:: of specific staining---staining%1:04:00:: by the direct and the indirect methods---method%1:09:00:: were similar and showed the localization---localization%1:04:00:: of WTV antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: in certain tissues---tissue%1:08:00:: of tumors---tumor%1:26:00:: .
The virus---virus%1:05:00:: antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: was concentrated in the pseudophloem---pseudophloem%1:20:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: .
Frequently a few isolated thick walled cells---cell%1:03:00:: or , rarely , groups---group%1:03:00:: of such cells---cell%1:03:00:: in the xylem---xylem%1:20:00:: region---region%1:08:00:: , were also specifically stained , but there was no such staining---staining%1:04:01:: in epidermis---epidermis%1:08:00:: , cortex---cortex%1:08:00:: , most xylem---xylem%1:20:00:: cells---cell%1:03:00:: , ray---ray%1:20:00:: cells---cell%1:03:00:: , or pith---pith%1:20:00:: .
Within the pseudophloem---pseudophloem%1:20:00:: cells---cell%1:03:00:: the distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: of WTV antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: was irregular in the cytoplasm---cytoplasm%1:08:00:: .
No antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: was detectable in certain dark spherical areas---area%1:08:00:: in most cells---cell%1:03:00:: .
These areas---area%1:08:00:: are thought to represent the nuclei---nucleus%1:08:00:: .
In some tumor---tumor%1:26:00:: sections---section%1:17:00:: small spherical bodies---body%1:17:00:: , possibly inclusion bodies---inclusion_body%1:17:00:: ( Littau---person%1:03:00:: and Black---person%1:03:00:: , 1952 ) stained more intensely than the rest---rest%1:24:00:: of cytoplasm---cytoplasm%1:08:00:: and probably contained more antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: .
In all cases---case%1:11:00:: studied tissues---tissue%1:08:00:: of the stem---stem%1:20:00:: on which the tumor---tumor%1:26:00:: had developed did not contain detectable amounts---amount%1:07:00:: of WTV antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: .
In both the direct and indirect methods---method%1:09:00:: of staining---staining%1:04:00:: , the conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: had nonspecifically staining---staining%1:04:01:: fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: .
In the indirect method---method%1:09:00:: , this was evident from the fact---fact%1:10:01:: that tumor---tumor%1:26:00:: sections---section%1:17:00:: were stained light green even when stained with NS and * * f or with * * f only .
In the direct method---method%1:09:00:: , * * f , not further treated , stained certain tissues---tissue%1:08:00:: of healthy sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: stems---stem%1:20:00:: nonspecifically and WTV tumor---tumor%1:26:00:: sections---section%1:17:00:: were similarly stained by comparable * * f .
After * * f and * * f were passed through Dowex-2-chloride twice and treated twice with healthy sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: powder---powder%1:27:00:: , nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:01:: was greatly reduced but a disturbing amount---amount%1:07:00:: of such staining---staining%1:04:01:: was still present .
Treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: of the conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: with ethyl acetate---ethyl_acetate%1:27:00:: , and the conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: ( which had been passed through Dowex-2-chloride ) with mouse---mouse%1:05:00:: liver---liver%1:08:00:: powder---powder%1:27:00:: , sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: crown gall---crown_gall%1:26:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: powder---powder%1:27:00:: , or healthy sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: proteins---protein%1:27:00:: did not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically staining---staining%1:04:01:: substances---substance%1:03:00:: in the conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: .
Such treatments---treatment%1:04:01:: of the conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: have usually been successful in eliminating nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:01:: in several other systems---system%1:27:00:: ( Coons---person%1:03:00:: , 1958 ) .
Schramm---person%1:03:00:: and Rottger---person%1:03:00:: ( 1959 ) did not report any such nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:01:: of plant tissues---plant_tissue%1:20:00:: with fluorescein---fluorescein%1:27:00:: isocyanate---isocyanate%1:27:00:: labeled antiserum---antiserum%1:08:00:: to tobacco mosaic virus---tobacco_mosaic_virus%1:05:00:: .
The reason---reason%1:10:01:: for the failure---failure%1:11:00:: of these treatments---treatment%1:04:01:: to eliminate nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:01:: in the conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: in our system---system%1:27:00:: is not known .
In our work---work%1:04:00:: the best procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: for removing substances---substance%1:03:00:: causing nonspecific staining---staining%1:04:01:: in order to obtain specific conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: was to pass the conjugates---conjugate%1:27:00:: through a DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: column---column%1:06:02:: and in some cases---case%1:11:00:: to absorb the first and second milliliter---milliliter%1:23:00:: fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: with sweet clover---sweet_clover%1:20:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: powder---powder%1:27:00:: .
The specific staining---staining%1:04:01:: by both direct and indirect methods---method%1:09:00:: showed that WTV antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: was concentrated in the pseudophloem---pseudophloem%1:20:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: and in a few thick walled cells---cell%1:03:00:: in the xylem---xylem%1:20:00:: region---region%1:08:00:: , but was not detectable in any other tissues---tissue%1:08:00:: of the root---root%1:20:00:: and stem---stem%1:20:00:: tumors---tumor%1:26:00:: .
A study---study%1:04:00:: of the distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: of WTV antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: within the pseudophloem---pseudophloem%1:20:00:: cells---cell%1:03:00:: indicates that it is irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm---cytoplasm%1:08:00:: .
Wound tumor virus---wound_tumor_virus%1:05:00:: is a leafhopper---leafhopper%1:05:00:: transmitted virus---virus%1:05:00:: not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation---inoculation%1:04:00:: ( Black---person%1:03:00:: , 1944 ; Brakke---person%1:03:00:: et al. , 1954 ) .
The concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: and apparent localization---localization%1:04:00:: of the WTV antigen---antigen%1:27:00:: in pseudophloem---pseudophloem%1:20:00:: tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: of the tumor---tumor%1:26:00:: may indicate that the virus---virus%1:05:00:: preferentially multiplies in the phloem---phloem%1:20:00:: and may need to be directly placed in this tissue---tissue%1:08:00:: in order to infect plants---plant%1:03:00:: .
It is worth dwelling in some detail---detail%1:09:00:: on the crisis---crisis%1:11:00:: of this story---story%1:10:03:: , because it brings together a number---number%1:07:00:: of characteristic elements---element%1:09:00:: and makes of them a curious , riddling compound---compound%1:09:00:: obscurely but centrally significant for Mann---person%1:03:00:: 's work---work%1:06:00:: .
The wife---wife%1:18:00:: , Amra---person%1:03:00:: , and her lover---lover%1:18:00:: are both savagely portrayed , she as incarnate sensuality---sensuality%1:12:00:: , `` voluptuous '' and `` indolent '' , possibly `` a mischief---mischief%1:04:00:: maker---maker%1:18:00:: '' , with `` a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of luxurious cunning '' to set against her apparent simplicity---simplicity%1:07:04:: , her `` bird---bird%1:05:00:: like brain---brain%1:09:00:: '' .
La^utner---person%1:03:00:: , for his part---part%1:09:02:: , `` belonged to the present-day race---race%1:14:00:: of small artists---artist%1:18:00:: , who do not demand the utmost of themselves '' , and the bitter description---description%1:10:01:: of the type---type%1:18:00:: includes such epithets---epithet%1:10:01:: as `` wretched little poseurs---poseur%1:18:00:: '' , the devastating indictment---indictment%1:10:01:: `` they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order '' , and the somewhat extreme prophecy---prophecy%1:09:00:: , so far not fulfilled : `` They will be destroyed '' .
The trick---trick%1:04:04:: these two play upon Jacoby---person%1:03:00:: reveals their want---want%1:26:00:: not simply of decency---decency%1:07:01:: but of imagination---imagination%1:09:03:: as well .
His appearance---appearance%1:09:00:: as Lizzy---person%1:03:00:: evokes not amusement---amusement%1:12:00:: but horror---horror%1:12:00:: in the audience---audience%1:14:00:: ; it is a spectacle---spectacle%1:10:00:: absolutely painful , an epiphany---epiphany%1:11:00:: of the suffering flesh---flesh%1:08:01:: unredeemed by spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: , untouched by any spirit---spirit%1:07:03:: other than abasement---abasement%1:26:00:: and humiliation---humiliation%1:26:00:: .
At the same time the multiple transvestitism---transvestitism%1:04:00:: involved - the fat man---man%1:18:00:: as girl---girl%1:18:02:: and as baby---baby%1:18:00:: , as coquette---coquette%1:18:00:: pretending to be a baby---baby%1:18:00:: - touches for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: horrifyingly upon the secret sources---source%1:09:00:: of a life---life%1:26:02:: like Jacoby---person%1:03:00:: 's , upon the sinister dreams---dream%1:09:02:: which form the sources---source%1:09:00:: of any human life---life%1:09:00:: .
The music---music%1:10:00:: which La^utner---person%1:03:00:: has composed for this episode---episode%1:11:00:: is for the most part `` rather pretty and perfectly banal '' .
But it is characteristic of him , we are told , `` his little artifice---artifice%1:04:00:: '' , to be able to introduce `` into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece---piece%1:11:00:: of hackwork---hackwork%1:04:00:: a sudden phrase---phrase%1:10:01:: of genuine creative art---art%1:09:00:: '' .
And this occurs now , at the refrain---refrain%1:10:00:: of Jacoby---person%1:03:00:: 's song---song%1:10:00:: - at the point---point%1:15:00:: , in fact , of the name---name%1:10:00:: `` Lizzy---person%1:03:00:: '' - ; a modulation---modulation%1:10:01:: described as `` almost a stroke---stroke%1:11:01:: of genius---genius%1:09:02:: '' .
`` A miracle---miracle%1:11:00:: , a revelation---revelation%1:09:00:: , it was like a curtain---curtain%1:06:00:: suddenly torn away to reveal something nude '' .
It is this modulation---modulation%1:10:01:: which reveals to Jacoby---person%1:03:00:: his own frightful abjection---abjection%1:26:01:: and , simultaneously , his wife---wife%1:18:00:: 's infidelity---infidelity%1:07:00:: .
By the same means---means%1:04:00:: he perceives this fact---fact%1:09:01:: as having communicated itself to the audience---audience%1:14:00:: ; he collapses , and dies .
In the work---work%1:06:00:: of every artist---artist%1:18:00:: , I suppose , there may be found one or more moments---moment%1:28:00:: which strike the student---student%1:18:01:: as absolutely decisive , ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ; not less strikingly so for being mysterious , as though some deeply hidden constatation---constatation%1:09:00:: of thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: were enciphered in a single image---image%1:09:00:: , a single moment---moment%1:28:00:: .
The horrifying humor---humor%1:10:00:: , the specifically sexual embarrassment---embarrassment%1:12:00:: of the joke---joke%1:10:00:: gone wrong , the monstrous image---image%1:09:00:: of the fat man---man%1:18:00:: dressed up as a whore---whore%1:18:00:: dressing up as a baby---baby%1:18:00:: ; the epiphany---epiphany%1:11:00:: of that quivering flesh---flesh%1:08:01:: ; the bringing together around it of the secret liaison---liaison%1:10:00:: between indolent , mindless sensuality---sensuality%1:12:00:: and sharp , shrewd talent---talent%1:09:00:: , cleverness---cleverness%1:09:01:: with an occasional touch---touch%1:10:01:: of genius---genius%1:09:02:: ( which , however , does not know `` how to attack the problem---problem%1:26:00:: of suffering---suffering%1:12:02:: '' ) ; the miraculous way---way%1:07:01:: in which music---music%1:10:00:: , revelation---revelation%1:09:00:: and death---death%1:26:00:: are associated in a single instant---instant%1:28:00:: - all this seems a triumph---triumph%1:11:00:: of art---art%1:09:00:: , a rather desperate art---art%1:09:00:: , in itself ; beyond itself , also , it evokes numerous and distant resonances---resonance%1:07:00:: from the entire body---body%1:10:00:: of Mann---person%1:03:00:: 's work---work%1:06:00:: .
When I try to work out my reasons---reason%1:16:00:: for feeling that this passage---passage%1:10:00:: is of critical significance---significance%1:07:00:: , I come up with the following ideas---idea%1:09:00:: , which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay---essay%1:10:00:: .
Love---love%1:12:00:: is the crucial dilemma---dilemma%1:09:00:: of experience---experience%1:09:00:: for Mann---person%1:03:00:: 's heroes---hero%1:09:00:: .
The dramatic construction---construction%1:09:00:: of his stories---story%1:10:00:: characteristically turns on a situation---situation%1:26:00:: in which someone---someone%1:03:00:: is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love .
The release---release%1:04:01:: , the freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: , involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible ; and the motion---motion%1:04:00:: toward it brings disaster---disaster%1:11:00:: .
This prohibition---prohibition%1:10:00:: on love---love%1:12:00:: has an especially poignant relation---relation%1:03:00:: to art---art%1:06:00:: ; it is particularly the artist---artist%1:18:00:: ( Tonio Kro^ger---person%1:03:00:: , Aschenbach---person%1:03:00:: , Leverku^hn---person%1:03:00:: ) who suffers from it .
The specific analogy to the dilemma---dilemma%1:09:00:: of love---love%1:12:00:: is the problem---problem%1:26:00:: of the `` breakthrough---breakthrough%1:09:00:: '' in the realm---realm%1:26:01:: of art---art%1:06:00:: .
Again , the sufferings---suffering%1:12:02:: and disasters---disaster%1:11:00:: produced by any transgression---transgression%1:04:00:: against the commandment---commandment%1:10:00:: not to love are almost invariably associated in one way---way%1:07:01:: or another with childhood---childhood%1:28:00:: , with the figure---figure%1:06:00:: of a child---child%1:18:00:: .
Finally , the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions---notion%1:09:02:: of dressing up , cosmetics , disguise---disguise%1:07:00:: , and especially change---change%1:06:00:: of costume---costume%1:06:00:: ( or singularity---singularity%1:07:01:: of costume---costume%1:06:00:: , as with Cipolla---person%1:03:00:: ) , are characteristically associated with the catastrophes---catastrophe%1:26:00:: of Mann---person%1:03:00:: 's stories---story%1:10:00:: .
We shall return to these statements---statement%1:10:00:: and deal with them more fully as the evidence---evidence%1:09:00:: for them accumulates .
For the present---present%1:28:00:: it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure---figure%1:06:00:: of Jacoby---person%1:03:00:: , at the moment---moment%1:28:00:: of his collapse---collapse%1:11:00:: , all these elements---element%1:09:00:: come together in prophetic parody---parody%1:10:00:: .
Professionally a lawyer---lawyer%1:18:00:: , that is to say associated with dignity---dignity%1:07:00:: , reserve---reserve%1:07:01:: , discipline---discipline%1:07:00:: , with much---much%1:23:00:: that is essentially middle-class , he is compelled by an impossible love---love%1:12:00:: to exhibit himself dressed up , disguised - that is , paradoxically , revealed - as a child---child%1:18:00:: , and , worse , as a whore---whore%1:18:00:: masquerading as a child---child%1:18:00:: .
That this abandonment---abandonment%1:04:01:: takes place on a stage---stage%1:06:00:: , during an ' artistic ' performance---performance%1:04:01:: , is enough to associate Jacoby---person%1:03:00:: with art---art%1:04:00:: , and to bring down upon him the punishment---punishment%1:04:00:: for art---art%1:04:00:: ; that is , he is suspect , guilty , punishable , as is anyone in Mann---person%1:03:00:: 's stories---story%1:10:00:: who produces illusion---illusion%1:04:00:: , and this is true even though the constant elements---element%1:09:00:: of the artist---artist%1:18:00:: nature---nature%1:07:02:: , technique---technique%1:09:01:: , magic---magic%1:09:00:: , guilt---guilt%1:12:00:: and suffering---suffering%1:12:02:: , are divided in this story---story%1:10:00:: between Jacoby---person%1:03:00:: and La^utner---person%1:03:00:: .
It appears that the dominant tendency---tendency%1:09:00:: of Mann---person%1:03:00:: 's early tales---tale%1:10:00:: , however pictorial or even picturesque the surface---surface%1:06:00:: , is already toward the symbolic , the emblematic , the expressionistic .
In a certain perfectly definite way---way%1:26:00:: , the method---method%1:09:00:: and the theme---theme%1:10:00:: of his stories---story%1:10:00:: are one and the same .
Something of this can be learned from `` The Way to the Churchyard '' ( 1901 ) , an anecdote---anecdote%1:10:00:: about an old failure---failure%1:18:00:: whose fit---fit%1:26:01:: of anger---anger%1:12:00:: at a passing cyclist---cyclist%1:18:00:: causes him to die of a stroke---stroke%1:26:00:: or seizure---seizure%1:26:00:: .
There is no more `` plot---plot%1:10:00:: '' than that ; only slightly more , perhaps , than a newspaper---newspaper%1:10:00:: account---account%1:10:03:: of such an incident---incident%1:11:00:: would give .
The artistic interest---interest%1:09:00:: , then , lies in what the encounter---encounter%1:04:01:: may be made to represent , in the power---power%1:07:00:: of some central significance---significance%1:07:00:: to draw the details---detail%1:24:00:: into relevance---relevance%1:24:00:: and meaningfulness---meaningfulness%1:07:00:: .
The first sentence---sentence%1:10:00:: , with its platitudinous irony---irony%1:10:01:: , announces an emblematic intent---intent%1:10:00:: : `` The way---way%1:15:00:: to the churchyard---churchyard%1:15:00:: ran along beside the highroad---highroad%1:06:00:: , ran beside it all the way to the end---end%1:15:00:: ; that is to say , to the churchyard---churchyard%1:15:00:: '' .
And the action---action%1:10:00:: is consistently presented with regard---regard%1:09:01:: for this distinction---distinction%1:07:01:: .
The highroad---highroad%1:06:00:: , one might say at first , belongs to life---life%1:09:00:: , while the way---way%1:06:00:: to the churchyard---churchyard%1:15:00:: belongs to death---death%1:26:00:: .
As the first sentence---sentence%1:10:00:: suggests , both roads---road%1:06:00:: belong to death---death%1:26:00:: in the end .
But the highroad---highroad%1:06:00:: , according to the description---description%1:10:01:: of its traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: , belongs to life---life%1:09:00:: as it is lived in unawareness---unawareness%1:09:00:: of death---death%1:26:00:: , while the way---way%1:15:00:: to the churchyard---churchyard%1:15:00:: belongs to some other sort---sort%1:09:00:: of life---life%1:09:00:: :
a suffering form---form%1:09:01:: , an existence---existence%1:26:00:: wholly comprised in the awareness---awareness%1:09:00:: of death---death%1:19:00:: .
Thus , on the highroad---highroad%1:06:00:: , a troop---troop%1:14:00:: of soldiers---soldier%1:18:00:: `` marched in their own dust---dust%1:27:00:: and sang '' , while on the footpath---footpath%1:06:00:: one man---man%1:18:00:: walks alone .
This man---man%1:18:00:: 's isolation---isolation%1:26:00:: is not merely momentary , it is permanent .
He is a widower---widower%1:18:00:: , his three children---child%1:18:01:: are dead , he has no one left on earth---earth%1:15:00:: ; also he is a drunk---drunk%1:18:00:: , and has lost his job---job%1:04:00:: on that account .
His name---name%1:10:00:: is Praisegod Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: , and he is rather fully described as to his clothing---clothing%1:06:00:: and physiognomy---physiognomy%1:08:00:: in a way which relates him to a sinister type---type%1:18:00:: in the author---author%1:18:00:: 's repertory---repertory%1:06:00:: - he is a forerunner---forerunner%1:18:00:: of those enigmatic strangers---stranger%1:18:00:: in `` Death in Venice '' , for example , who represent some combination---combination%1:14:00:: of cadaver---cadaver%1:08:00:: , exotic , and psychopomp---psychopomp%1:18:00:: .
This strange person---person%1:03:00:: quarrels with a cyclist---cyclist%1:18:00:: because the latter is using the path---path%1:06:00:: rather than the highroad---highroad%1:06:00:: .
The cyclist---cyclist%1:18:00:: , a sufficiently commonplace young fellow---fellow%1:18:00:: , is not named but identified simply as `` Life---person%1:03:00:: '' - that and a license number---license_number%1:10:00:: , which Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: uses in addressing him .
`` Life---person%1:03:00:: '' points out that `` everybody uses this path---path%1:06:00:: '' , and starts to ride on .
Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: tries to stop him by force---force%1:07:00:: , receives a push---push%1:04:00:: in the chest---chest%1:08:00:: from `` Life---person%1:03:00:: '' , and is left standing in impotent and growing rage---rage%1:12:00:: , while a crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: begins to gather .
His rage---rage%1:12:00:: assumes a religious form---form%1:09:00:: ; that is , on the basis---basis%1:24:00:: of his own sinfulness---sinfulness%1:07:00:: and abject wretchedness---wretchedness%1:26:00:: , Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: becomes a prophet---prophet%1:18:00:: who in his ecstasy---ecstasy%1:26:02:: and in the name---name%1:10:00:: of God---god%1:18:00:: imprecates doom---doom%1:11:00:: on Life---person%1:03:00:: - not only the cyclist---cyclist%1:18:00:: now , but the audience---audience%1:14:00:: , the world , as well : `` all you light-headed breed '' .
This passion---passion%1:16:00:: brings on a fit---fit%1:26:00:: which proves fatal .
Then an ambulance---ambulance%1:06:00:: comes along , and they drive Praisegod Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: away .
This is simple enough , but several more points---point%1:09:01:: of interest---interest%1:09:00:: may be mentioned as relevant .
The season---season%1:28:00:: , between spring---spring%1:28:00:: and summer---summer%1:28:00:: , belongs to life---life%1:09:00:: in its carefree aspect---aspect%1:09:00:: .
Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: 's fatal rage---rage%1:12:00:: arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist---cyclist%1:18:00:: , but also because God---god%1:18:00:: will not stop him ; as Piepsam---location%1:03:00:: says to the crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: in his last moments---moment%1:28:00:: : `` His justice---justice%1:07:00:: is not of this world---world%1:09:01:: '' .
Life---person%1:03:00:: is further characterized , in antithesis---antithesis%1:24:00:: to Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: , as animal---animal%1:03:00:: : the image---image%1:10:00:: of a dog---dog%1:05:00:: , which appears at several places---place%1:15:00:: , is first given as the criterion---criterion%1:09:00:: of amiable , irrelevant interest---interest%1:09:00:: aroused by life---life%1:09:00:: considered simply as a spectacle---spectacle%1:10:00:: : a dog---dog%1:05:00:: in a wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: is `` admirable '' , `` a pleasure---pleasure%1:09:00:: to contemplate '' ; another wagon---wagon%1:06:00:: has no dog---dog%1:05:00:: , and therefore is `` devoid of interest---interest%1:09:00:: '' .
Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: calls the cyclist---cyclist%1:18:00:: `` cur---cur%1:05:00:: '' and `` puppy---puppy%1:05:00:: '' among other things---thing%1:06:00:: , and at the crisis---crisis%1:11:00:: of his fit---fit%1:26:01:: a little fox-terrier---fox_terrier%1:05:00:: stands before him and howls---howl%1:10:00:: into his face---face%1:08:00:: .
The ambulance---ambulance%1:06:00:: is drawn by two `` charming '' little horses---horse%1:05:00:: .
Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: is not , certainly , religious in any conventional sense---sense%1:10:00:: .
His religiousness---religiousness%1:07:00:: is intimately , or dialectically , connected with his sinfulness---sinfulness%1:07:00:: ; the two may in fact be identical .
His unsuccessful strivings---striving%1:04:00:: to give up drink---drink%1:04:00:: are represented as religious strivings---striving%1:04:00:: ; he keeps a bottle---bottle%1:06:00:: in a wardrobe---wardrobe%1:06:00:: at home---home%1:15:04:: , and `` before this wardrobe---wardrobe%1:06:00:: Praisegod Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: had before now gone literally on his knees---knee%1:08:00:: , and in his wrestlings---wrestling%1:04:01:: had bitten his tongue---tongue%1:08:00:: - and still in the end capitulated '' .
The cyclist---cyclist%1:18:00:: , by contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: , blond and blue-eyed , is simply unreflective , unproblematic Life---person%1:03:00:: , `` blithe and carefree '' .
`` He made no claims---claim%1:10:00:: to belong to the great and mighty of this earth---earth%1:17:00:: '' .
Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: is grotesque , a disturbing parody---parody%1:10:00:: ; his end---end%1:26:00:: is ridiculous and trivial .
He is `` a man---man%1:18:00:: raving mad on the way to the churchyard---churchyard%1:15:00:: '' .
But he is more interesting than the others , the ones who come from the highroad---highroad%1:06:00:: to watch him , more interesting than Life---person%1:03:00:: considered as a cyclist---cyclist%1:18:00:: .
And if I have gone into so much detail---detail%1:10:00:: about so small a work---work%1:06:00:: , that is because it is also so typical a work---work%1:06:00:: , representing the germinal form---form%1:09:01:: of a conflict---conflict%1:12:00:: which remains essential in Mann---person%1:03:00:: 's writing---writing%1:04:02:: :
the crude sketch---sketch%1:10:03:: of Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: contains , in its critical , destructive and self-destructive tendencies---tendency%1:07:00:: , much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures---figure%1:06:00:: of , for instance , Naphta---person%1:03:00:: and Leverku^hn---person%1:03:00:: .
In method---method%1:09:00:: as well as in theme---theme%1:10:00:: this little anecdote---anecdote%1:10:00:: with its details---detail%1:09:00:: selected as much for expressiveness---expressiveness%1:07:00:: and allegory---allegory%1:10:00:: as for `` realism---realism%1:09:00:: '' , anticipates a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of musical composition---musical_composition%1:10:00:: , as well as a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of fictional composition---composition%1:10:01:: , in which , as Leverku^hn---person%1:03:00:: says , `` there shall be nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: unthematic '' .
It resembles , too , pictures---picture%1:06:01:: such as Du^rer---person%1:03:00:: and Bruegel---person%1:03:00:: did , in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary , the representation---representation%1:09:00:: of a proverb---proverb%1:10:00:: , for example , or a deadly sin---deadly_sin%1:04:00:: .
`` Gladius Dei '' ( 1902 ) resembles `` The Way to the Churchyard '' in its representation of a conflict between light---light%1:07:00:: and dark---dark%1:26:01:: , between `` Life '' and a spirit of criticism , negation , melancholy , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict .
`` Gladius Dei '' ( 1902 ) resembles `` The Way to the Churchyard '' in its representation---representation%1:09:00:: of a conflict---conflict%1:12:00:: between light---light%1:26:01:: and dark---dark%1:26:00:: , between `` Life---person%1:03:00:: '' and a spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: of criticism---criticism%1:10:00:: , negation , melancholy---melancholy%1:12:00:: , but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements---element%1:09:00:: of this conflict---conflict%1:12:00:: .
The monk---monk%1:18:00:: Savonarola---person%1:03:00:: , brought over from the Renaissance---renaissance%1:28:00:: and placed against the background---background%1:11:01:: of Munich---munich%1:15:00:: at the turn of the century---turn_of_the_century%1:28:00:: , protests against the luxurious works---work%1:06:00:: displayed in the art---art%1:06:00:: shop---shop%1:06:00:: of M. Bluthenzweig---person%1:03:00:: ; in particular---particular%1:09:00:: against a Madonna---person%1:03:00:: portrayed in a voluptuous style---style%1:07:00:: and modeled , according to gossip---gossip%1:10:01:: , upon the painter---painter%1:18:00:: 's mistress---mistress%1:18:01:: .
Hieronymus---person%1:03:00:: , like Piepsam---person%1:03:00:: , makes his protest---protest%1:10:00:: quite in vain , and his rejection---rejection%1:26:00:: , though not fatal , is ridiculous and humiliating ; he is simply thrown out of the shop---shop%1:06:00:: by the porter---porter%1:18:02:: .
On the street---street%1:06:00:: outside---outside%1:15:01:: , Hieronymus---person%1:03:00:: envisions a holocaust---holocaust%1:04:00:: of the vanities---vanity%1:12:00:: of this world---world%1:09:00:: , such a burning---burning%1:04:00:: of artistic and erotic productions---production%1:06:00:: as his namesake---namesake%1:18:00:: actually brought to pass in Florence---florence%1:15:00:: , and prophetically he issues his curse---curse%1:10:01:: : `` Gladius Dei super terram cito et velociter '' .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: did not see the newspapers---newspaper%1:10:00:: the next day---day%1:28:01:: .
Someone---someone%1:03:00:: on his staff---staff%1:14:01:: - he suspected it was Ed Thornburg---person%1:03:00:: - intercepted them and for this Andy---person%1:03:00:: was grateful .
He finally fell asleep around six in the morning---morning%1:28:00:: with the aid---aid%1:04:00:: of a sleeping capsule---sleeping_capsule%1:06:00:: , a crutch---crutch%1:04:00:: he rarely used , and did n't awaken until early afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: .
Memory---memory%1:09:02:: flooded him the instant---instant%1:28:00:: he opened his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and the sick feeling---feeling%1:09:01:: knotted his stomach---stomach%1:08:00:: .
Outside his window---window%1:06:00:: bloomed a beautiful summer---summer%1:28:00:: day---day%1:28:02:: .
Presumably the same sun---sun%1:17:00:: was shining upon little Drew---person%1:03:00:: also , and those who had kidnapped him .
It was still a very big world---world%1:17:00:: , despite all the modern cant---cant%1:10:01:: to the contrary .
Hub---person%1:03:00:: was sitting in a chair---chair%1:06:00:: that blocked the hall---hall%1:06:05:: door---door%1:06:01:: .
He was dozing , perhaps the only sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: he 'd gotten .
He snapped to alertness---alertness%1:09:00:: at Andy---person%1:03:00:: 's entrance---entrance%1:11:00:: .
`` Sorry , Mr. Paxton---person%1:03:00:: .
Lot of people---people%1:14:00:: waiting to see you , though '' .
`` Reporters---reporter%1:18:00:: '' ?
`` Our own people---people%1:14:00:: .
Questions---question%1:10:00:: about the show---show%1:04:00:: tonight '' .
Hub---person%1:03:00:: picked up the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: .
How 's Lissa---person%1:03:00:: , do you know '' ?
Hub---person%1:03:00:: considered .
She 's got plenty---plenty%1:07:00:: of guts---guts%1:07:00:: , Mr. Paxton---person%1:03:00:: .
Hub---person%1:03:00:: shook his head---head%1:08:00:: so Andy---person%1:03:00:: told him not to bother .
The only reason---reason%1:16:00:: for contacting Lissa---person%1:03:00:: was to comfort or to be comforted .
He could not manage the former or expect the latter ; they had nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to give to each other .
The omission---omission%1:04:01:: might look peculiar to outsiders---outsider%1:18:00:: , but Andy---person%1:03:00:: could not bring himself to go through the motions simply for the sake---sake%1:07:00:: of appearances---appearance%1:07:00:: .
He had little time---time%1:28:05:: to himself , anyway .
As the afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: sped toward evening---evening%1:28:00:: , the suite---suite%1:14:00:: saw a steady procession of Paxton---person%1:03:00:: aides---aide%1:18:00:: pass in and out , each with his own special problem---problem%1:26:00:: .
Thornburg---person%1:03:00:: arrived with the writers---writer%1:18:00:: .
They had spent the morning---morning%1:28:00:: revising the act---act%1:10:02:: , eliminating all the gay songs---song%1:10:00:: , patter---patter%1:10:00:: and dancing---dancing%1:04:00:: with a view---view%1:09:00:: of the best public relations---public_relations%1:10:00:: .
What remained lacked the original verve---verve%1:07:00:: but it was at least dignified , as befitting the tragic circumstances---circumstance%1:26:01:: .
Raymond Fox---person%1:03:00:: reported that the orchestra---orchestra%1:14:00:: had hastily rehearsed `` Cradle Song '' in case it was needed .
Charlie Marble---person%1:03:00:: was back and forth on several occasions---occasion%1:11:01:: , first to confer with Andy---person%1:03:00:: on the advisability---advisability%1:07:00:: of cancelling the Las Vegas---las_vegas%1:15:00:: engagement---engagement%1:14:00:: - they decided it was wise - and later to announce that a prominent comedian---comedian%1:18:00:: , also an agency---agency%1:14:01:: client---client%1:18:00:: , had agreed to fill the casino---casino%1:06:00:: 's open date---date%1:14:00:: .
And once Bake---person%1:03:00:: slipped in , pale and drawn , last night---night%1:28:00:: 's liquor---liquor%1:13:00:: still on his breath---breath%1:27:00:: with some of today---today%1:28:01:: 's added to it .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: invented a job---job%1:04:01:: to keep him busy , sending him ahead to El Dorado---location%1:03:00:: to supervise last minute arrangements---arrangement%1:09:01:: .
But from Rocco Vecchio---location%1:03:00:: , they heard nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
At last it was time---time%1:28:06:: to depart .
Hub---person%1:03:00:: , nosing about , spotted reporters---reporter%1:18:00:: in the lobby---lobby%1:06:00:: , so Andy---person%1:03:00:: was hustled away quietly through the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: 's service entrance---service_entrance%1:06:00:: in a strange car---car%1:06:00:: which Hub---person%1:03:00:: had procured somewhere .
They succeeded in eluding the curious at the hotel---hotel%1:06:00:: , but there was no chance---chance%1:26:00:: of avoiding them at the nightclub---nightclub%1:06:00:: .
El Dorado---location%1:03:00:: was surrounded by a mob---mob%1:14:00:: .
They overflowed the parking lot---parking_lot%1:15:00:: , making progress---progress%1:11:00:: by automobile---automobile%1:06:00:: difficult .
Long before he reached the protection---protection%1:06:00:: of the stage door---stage_door%1:06:00:: , Andy---person%1:03:00:: was recognized .
Word---word%1:10:02:: of his arrival---arrival%1:04:00:: spread through the crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: like a brush-fire---brush_fire%1:11:00:: .
They surged around him , fingers---finger%1:08:00:: pointing , eyes---eye%1:08:00:: prying .
It was not a hostile gathering---gathering%1:04:00:: but Andy---person%1:03:00:: sensed the difference---difference%1:07:00:: from last night---night%1:28:00:: 's hero-worshippers---hero_worshipper%1:18:00:: .
`` It 's worse inside '' , Thornburg---person%1:03:00:: informed Andy---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Skolman---person%1:03:00:: 's jammed in every table---table%1:06:02:: he could find .
Under the heading---heading%1:10:00:: of it 's an ill wind---wind%1:19:00:: , et cetera '' .
Backstage---backstage%1:06:00:: was tomb---tomb%1:06:00:: like by contrast---contrast%1:24:00:: .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: 's co-workers---co-worker%1:18:00:: kept their distance---distance%1:07:00:: , awed by the tragedy---tragedy%1:11:00:: .
But in his dressing room---dressing_room%1:06:00:: was a large bouquet---bouquet%1:06:00:: and a card---card%1:10:00:: that read , `` We 're with you all the way '' .
It was signed by everyone in the troupe---troupe%1:14:00:: .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: could n't help but be touched .
He instructed Shirl Winter---person%1:03:00:: to compose a note---note%1:10:03:: of thanks---thanks%1:10:00:: to be posted on the call board---call-board%1:06:00:: .
Bake---person%1:03:00:: was waiting to report that Lou DuVol---person%1:03:00:: had been sobered up to the point---point%1:26:00:: where he could function efficiently .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: gathered that this had been no small accomplishment---accomplishment%1:04:00:: .
Bake---person%1:03:00:: himself looked better ; any kind---kind%1:09:00:: of job---job%1:04:01:: was better than brooding .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: told him , `` Bake---person%1:03:00:: , I wish you 'd talk to Skolman---person%1:03:00:: , see if some kind---kind%1:09:00:: of p. a. system---pa_system%1:06:00:: can be rigged up outside .
It 's just barely possible with this crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: that the kidnapper---kidnapper%1:18:00:: was n't able to get a table---table%1:06:02:: .
I would n't want him to miss the message---message%1:10:00:: '' .
Skolman---person%1:03:00:: is n't going to like it much , though , giving away what he should be selling '' .
Skolman---person%1:03:00:: was n't the only one who did n't care for Andy---person%1:03:00:: 's scheme---scheme%1:09:00:: .
A short time---time%1:28:00:: later , Lieutenant Bonner---person%1:03:00:: stomped into the dressing room---dressing_room%1:06:00:: .
`` I got a bone to pick with you , Mr. Paxton---person%1:03:00:: .
It 's those damn loudspeakers---loudspeaker%1:06:00:: '' .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: rolled up the revised script---script%1:10:00:: he had been studying .
My men---men%1:14:00:: have been here all afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: , setting up for this thing---thing%1:11:00:: '' .
Bonner---person%1:03:00:: explained that , with the nightclub---nightclub%1:06:00:: 's cooperation---cooperation%1:04:01:: , the police---police%1:14:00:: had occupied El Dorado---location%1:03:00:: like a battlefield---battlefield%1:15:00:: .
Motion picture---motion_picture%1:10:00:: cameras---camera%1:06:00:: had been installed to film the audience---audience%1:14:00:: , the reservation---reservation%1:04:01:: list---list%1:10:00:: was being checked out name---name%1:10:00:: by name---name%1:10:00:: , and a special detail---detail%1:14:01:: was already at work in the parking lot---parking_lot%1:15:00:: scrutinizing automobiles---automobile%1:06:00:: for a possible lead---lead%1:09:00:: .
However , it was virtually impossible to screen the mob---mob%1:14:00:: outside , even if Bonner---person%1:03:00:: had manpower---manpower%1:14:00:: available for the purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: .
`` I want you to have the speakers---speaker%1:06:00:: taken out '' .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: sighed .
`` Seems like we 're never going to see eye to eye , Lieutenant---lieutenant%1:18:00:: .
Did n't they tell you what I wanted the p. a. system---pa_system%1:06:00:: for '' ?
But it 's such a long shot---long_shot%1:04:00:: '' -
You think somebody is going to stand up in the audience---audience%1:14:00:: and make guilty faces---face%1:07:03:: ?
Or have a sign---sign%1:06:01:: on his car---car%1:06:00:: that says , ' Here Comes the Paxton---location%1:03:00:: Kidnapper---kidnapper%1:18:00:: '' ' ?
Andy---person%1:03:00:: crumbled the script---script%1:10:00:: in his fist---fist%1:08:00:: .
`` Someday '' , Bonner---person%1:03:00:: said , `` you 're going to ask us for help---help%1:04:00:: .
But Bonner---person%1:03:00:: departed , still full of ill will---ill_will%1:12:00:: .
He had gotten stuck with a job---job%1:04:01:: too big for his imagination---imagination%1:09:03:: ; he had to cling to routine---routine%1:04:00:: , tested procedures---procedure%1:04:00:: .
To act otherwise would be to admit his helplessness---helplessness%1:07:00:: .
But , admit or not , Bonner---person%1:03:00:: was helpless .
The crime---crime%1:04:00:: showed too much planning---planning%1:04:00:: , the kidnappers---kidnapper%1:18:00:: appeared too proficient to be caught by a checklist---checklist%1:10:00:: .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: 's performance---performance%1:04:01:: was scheduled for eleven o'clock .
He stalled for a half-hour---half-hour%1:28:00:: longer , hoping to hear something from Vecchio---person%1:03:00:: about the ransom money---ransom_money%1:21:00:: .
Bake---person%1:03:00:: and Shirl Winter---person%1:03:00:: , on separate telephones---telephone%1:06:00:: , could not reach him at any conceivable location---location%1:03:00:: in Los Angeles---los_angeles%1:15:00:: , nor could they secure any clear-cut information---information%1:10:00:: regarding his efforts---effort%1:04:00:: .
Bake---person%1:03:00:: cursed .
`` The sweaty bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: 's probably halfway to Peru---peru%1:15:00:: with our money---money%1:21:00:: by now '' .
Thornburg---person%1:03:00:: popped in to advise , `` Andy---person%1:03:00:: , Skolman---person%1:03:00:: 's sending up smoke signals .
Bake---person%1:03:00:: asked .
We got a bunch---bunch%1:14:00:: of sippers---sipper%1:18:00:: out there tonight .
Thornburg---person%1:03:00:: added in a lower voice---voice%1:10:00:: but Andy---person%1:03:00:: overheard , `` They act more like a jury---jury%1:14:00:: than an audience---audience%1:14:00:: '' .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: said , `` Well , I guess we can n't wait any longer .
Hub---person%1:03:00:: , you stick by the stage door---stage_door%1:06:00:: .
If Rock---person%1:03:00:: shows up during the number---number%1:10:04:: - or you hear anything - give me the signal---signal%1:10:00:: '' .
Shirl Winter---person%1:03:00:: said , `` I 'll stay on the phone---phone%1:06:00:: , Mr. Paxton---person%1:03:00:: .
There 's a couple of call-backs---call-back%1:10:00:: I can work on '' .
`` You 're a sweetheart---sweetheart%1:18:02:: - but leave one line---line%1:06:07:: open .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: passed into the corridor---corridor%1:06:00:: , their `` good lucks '' ! following him .
It was what they said before every performance---performance%1:04:01:: but tonight it sounded different , as if he really needed it .
The act---act%1:10:02:: , cut to shreds---shred%1:23:00:: and hastily patched together during the afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: , had not been rehearsed sufficiently by anyone .
The result---result%1:11:00:: had nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: of the polish---polish%1:26:00:: , pace---pace%1:07:01:: or cohesion---cohesion%1:26:00:: of the previous night---night%1:28:00:: .
Here 's where luck---luck%1:19:00:: would normally step in .
But this was no ordinary show---show%1:04:00:: and Andy---person%1:03:00:: knew it .
Whether he sang well or badly had nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to do with it .
The audience---audience%1:14:00:: had come not to be entertained but to judge .
Twenty-four hours---twenty-four_hours%1:28:00:: had changed him from a performer---performer%1:18:00:: to a freak---freak%1:18:00:: .
Within this framework---framework%1:09:00:: , what followed was strained , even macabre .
Eliminating the patter---patter%1:10:00:: and the upbeat numbers---number%1:10:04:: left little---little%1:23:00:: but blues---blues%1:10:00:: and other songs---song%1:10:00:: of equal melancholy---melancholy%1:12:00:: .
The effect---effect%1:19:00:: was as depressing as a gravestone---gravestone%1:06:00:: , the applause---applause%1:10:00:: irresolute and short-lived .
Yet Andy---person%1:03:00:: plowed ahead , mouthing the inconsequential words---words%1:10:02:: as if they possessed real meaning---meaning%1:10:00:: , and gradually his listeners---listener%1:18:00:: warmed to him .
Their clapping---clapping%1:10:00:: grew more fervent ; the evening---evening%1:28:00:: was still not beyond salvaging , not as a show---show%1:04:00:: but for him as a person---person%1:03:00:: .
As Andy---person%1:03:00:: reached the finale of his act---act%1:10:02:: , a subdued commotion---commotion%1:26:00:: backstage---backstage%1:06:00:: drew his attention---attention%1:09:00:: to the wings---wing%1:06:03:: .
Rocco Vecchio---person%1:03:00:: - a perspiring , haggard Vecchio---person%1:03:00:: - was standing there , flanked by two men---man%1:18:00:: in the uniforms---uniform%1:06:00:: of armored transport---transport%1:06:00:: guards---guard%1:18:03:: .
Vecchio---person%1:03:00:: was nodding and pointing at the large suitcase---suitcase%1:06:00:: he held .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: felt his heart---heart%1:08:00:: thud heavily with relief---relief%1:12:00:: .
He waved at Fox---person%1:03:00:: to cut off the finale introduction---introduction%1:10:00:: .
The music---music%1:10:00:: died away discordantly .
He drew a deep breath---breath%1:04:00:: .
`` Ladies---lady%1:18:02:: and gentlemen---gentleman%1:18:00:: , in place of my regular closing number---number%1:10:04:: tonight , I 'd like to sing something of a different nature---nature%1:07:02:: for you .
Ray---person%1:03:00:: , if you please - the ' Cradle Song '' ' .
He sensed rather than heard the gasp---gasp%1:04:00:: that swept across the audience---audience%1:14:00:: .
This particular song---song%1:10:00:: at this particular time---time%1:11:00:: could only be interpreted as the ultimate in bad taste---taste%1:09:01:: , callous exploitation---exploitation%1:04:01:: beyond the bounds---bounds%1:15:00:: of decency---decency%1:07:00:: .
Having no choice---choice%1:09:02:: , he plunged into it , anyway , holding onto the microphone---microphone%1:06:00:: for support---support%1:04:01:: .
voice---voice%1:10:00:: shook .
For the first time in his life---life%1:28:01:: he forgot the lyrics---lyric%1:10:01:: midway through and had to cover up by humming the rest---rest%1:24:00:: .
He wondered if the audience---audience%1:14:00:: would let him finish .
But when he was finally through , their scorn---scorn%1:12:00:: was made apparent .
Someone---someone%1:03:00:: clapped tentatively then quickly stopped .
Otherwise , the silence---silence%1:07:00:: was complete .
As the lights---light%1:06:00:: came up , Andy---person%1:03:00:: could see that a number---number%1:07:00:: of patrons---patron%1:18:00:: were already on their way---way%1:04:02:: toward the exit---exit%1:06:00:: .
He stumbled off-stage---offstage%1:06:00:: .
Hub---person%1:03:00:: was there to support him .
`` It 's okay , Mr. Paxton---location%1:03:00:: .
The money---money%1:21:00:: 's here , all of it '' .
At this moment---moment%1:28:00:: , all he could think of was what he 'd been forced to undergo .
`` Bunch---bunch%1:14:00:: of damn jerks---jerk%1:18:00:: '' , Hub---person%1:03:00:: growled .
Thornburg---person%1:03:00:: patted his arm---arm%1:08:00:: .
`` Sure , Andy---person%1:03:00:: , it 'll be all right .
The words---words%1:10:03:: were hollow .
Thornburg---person%1:03:00:: knew , better than any of them , that a public image---image%1:07:00:: was as fragile as Humpty Dumpty---person%1:03:00:: .
All the king---king%1:18:00:: 's horses---horse%1:05:00:: and all the king---king%1:18:00:: 's men---man%1:18:03:: .
Vecchio---location%1:03:00:: shouldered in .
`` I got it , Andy---person%1:03:00:: .
You 'll never believe the places---place%1:15:00:: I 've been today .
I practically had to sign your life---life%1:26:00:: away , you 'll probably fire me for some of the deals---deal%1:04:02:: I had to go for , but '' -
Andy---person%1:03:00:: nodded dully .
`` It does n't matter , Rock---person%1:03:00:: .
We 've done our part---part%1:09:02:: '' .
He clutched that knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: to him as he returned to his dressing room---dressing_room%1:06:00:: .
The usual congratulatory crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: was conspicuously absent ; the place---place%1:15:04:: had the air---air%1:07:00:: of a morgue---morgue%1:06:00:: .
Andy---person%1:03:00:: had no desire---desire%1:07:00:: to linger himself but Hub---person%1:03:00:: reported that the mob---mob%1:14:00:: outside was still large despite the efforts---effort%1:04:00:: of the police---police%1:14:00:: to disperse them .
They neither liked nor disliked the Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: .
To them he could have been the broken bell---bell%1:06:00:: in the church tower---church_tower%1:06:00:: which rang before and after Mass---mass%1:04:00:: , and at noon---noon%1:28:00:: , and at six---six%1:23:00:: each evening---evening%1:28:00:: - its tone---tone%1:09:00:: , repetitive , monotonous , never breaking the boredom---boredom%1:12:00:: of the streets---street%1:06:00:: .
The Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: was unimportant .
Yet if he were not there , they would have missed him , as they would have missed the sounds---sound%1:09:00:: of bees---bee%1:05:00:: buzzing against the screen door---screen_door%1:06:00:: in early June---june%1:28:00:: ; or the smell---smell%1:09:02:: of thick tomato paste---tomato_paste%1:13:00:: - the ripe smell---smell%1:09:02:: that was both sweet and sour - rising up from aluminum---aluminum%1:27:00:: trays---tray%1:06:00:: wrapped in fly---fly%1:05:00:: dotted cheesecloth---cheesecloth%1:06:00:: .
Or the surging whirling sounds---sound%1:09:00:: of bats---bat%1:05:00:: at night---night%1:28:00:: , when their black bodies---body%1:08:00:: dived into the blackness---blackness%1:26:00:: above and below the amber street lights---streetlight%1:06:00:: .
Or the bay---bay%1:11:00:: of female dogs---dog%1:05:00:: in heat---heat%1:26:00:: .
They never called him by name---name%1:10:00:: , although he had one .
Filippo Rossi---person%1:03:00:: , that 's what he was called in the old country---old_country%1:15:00:: ; but here he was just Signore---signore%1:18:00:: or the Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: .
But this was not unusual , because youth---youth%1:14:00:: in these quarters---quarter%1:15:00:: was always pushed at a distance---distance%1:12:00:: from its elders---elder%1:18:00:: .
Youth---youth%1:14:00:: obeyed when commanded .
It went to church---church%1:04:00:: on Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: and one Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: a month---month%1:28:01:: went to confession---confession%1:04:00:: .
But youth---youth%1:14:00:: asked nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: of its parents---parent%1:18:00:: - not a touch---touch%1:11:00:: of the hand---hand%1:08:00:: or a kiss---kiss%1:04:00:: given in passing .
The only thing---thing%1:07:00:: unusual about the Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: had long since happened .
But the past---past%1:28:00:: was dead here as the present---present%1:28:00:: was dead .
Once the Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: had had a wife---wife%1:18:00:: .
With a tiny fur-piece---fur-piece%1:06:00:: wrapped around her shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: , she wiggled her satin---satin%1:06:00:: covered buttocks---buttocks%1:08:00:: down the street---street%1:06:00:: before him and did n't stop .
In one hand---hand%1:08:00:: she clutched a hundred dollar bill---hundred_dollar_bill%1:21:00:: and in the other a straw---straw%1:27:00:: suitcase---suitcase%1:06:00:: .
The way---way%1:07:01:: she strutted down the street---street%1:06:00:: , the Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: would have been blind not to have noticed both .
Without looking at him , without looking at anything except Drexel Street---location%1:03:00:: directly in front of her , she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars---streetcar%1:06:00:: , rode away in it , and never came back .
`` But she should n't have come here in the first place '' , the women---woman%1:18:00:: had said .
She thought she was bigger than we are because she came from Torino---location%1:03:00:: '' .
`` Eh , Torino---location%1:03:00:: !
She gave herself fancy airs---airs%1:07:00:: !
Just because she had a part---part%1:09:01:: on the stage in the old country---old_country%1:15:00:: , she thought she could carry her head---head%1:08:00:: higher than ours '' .
They had slapped their thighs---thigh%1:08:00:: .
`` It 's not for making pretty speeches---speech%1:10:01:: about Dante---dante%1:18:00:: those actresses---actress%1:18:00:: get paid so good '' .
Calloused fingers---finger%1:08:00:: , caressed only by the smoothness---smoothness%1:07:00:: of polished rosaries---rosary%1:06:00:: , had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins---chin%1:08:00:: where tiny black hairs---hair%1:08:00:: sprouted , never to be tweezed away .
Mauve colored mouths---mouth%1:08:01:: that had never known anything sweeter than the taste---taste%1:09:02:: of new wine---wine%1:13:00:: and the passion---passion%1:12:02:: of man---man%1:18:00:: 's tongue---tongue%1:08:00:: had not smiled , but had condemned again and again .
But if the Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: even thought about his wife---wife%1:18:00:: now , nobody cared a fig .
It was enough for people---people%1:14:00:: to know that at one time he had looked down the street---street%1:06:00:: at the fleshy suppleness---suppleness%1:07:00:: of a woman---woman%1:18:00:: he had consumed - watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance---distance%1:15:00:: , as thin as the seams---seam%1:06:00:: on her stockings---stocking%1:06:00:: , and still thinner .
His voice---voice%1:10:00:: had not commanded her to stop .
The women---woman%1:18:00:: said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell---farewell%1:10:00:: ; but he might have been shooing away the fleas---flea%1:05:00:: that hopped from his yellow dog---dog%1:05:00:: onto him .
( He was never without that dog---dog%1:05:00:: . )
And his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: - those miniature sundials---sundial%1:06:00:: of variegated yellow - had not altered their expression---expression%1:07:00:: or direction---direction%1:15:00:: .
The Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: 's very soul---soul%1:18:00:: could have left him and flown down that street---street%1:06:00:: , but he would n't have had anyone know it .
Perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill---hundred_dollar_bill%1:21:00:: had come from and where it was taking his wife---wife%1:18:00:: .
But when he called for his withered , wrinkled sister---sister%1:18:00:: Rose---person%1:03:00:: to care for him and the children---child%1:18:01:: , had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman---woman%1:18:00:: was the memory---memory%1:09:02:: of her climbing into that streetcar---streetcar%1:06:00:: ?
There seemed to be a contemptuous purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: in the way---way%1:07:01:: he sat there with his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: glued to Drexel Street---location%1:03:00:: and his back---back%1:08:00:: in opposition to the church---church%1:06:00:: behind him .
For all he saw or cared to see , this could have been a town---town%1:15:00:: in Italy---italy%1:15:00:: , not the outskirts---outskirts%1:15:00:: of Philadelphia---philadelphia%1:15:00:: .
It could have been Bari---location%1:03:00:: or Chieti---location%1:03:00:: for the way---way%1:07:01:: it smelled .
What did it matter to him that the park---park%1:15:01:: at the foot---foot%1:15:00:: of Ash Road---location%1:03:00:: stretched beneath elevated trains---train%1:06:00:: that roared from the stucco---stucco%1:27:00:: station---station%1:06:00:: into the city---city%1:15:00:: 's center---center%1:15:01:: at half-hour---half-hour%1:28:00:: intervals---interval%1:28:00:: ?
Or that the tiny creek---creek%1:17:00:: spun its silent course---course%1:15:00:: toward the Schuylkill---location%1:03:00:: ?
This place---place%1:15:00:: was hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: to him , just as hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: was his only companion---companion%1:18:00:: in his aloneness---aloneness%1:07:00:: .
Sameness---sameness%1:07:00:: for the Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: was framed in by a wall---wall%1:17:00:: of ginkgo---ginkgo%1:20:00:: trees---tree%1:20:00:: which divided these quarters---quarter%1:15:00:: from the city---city%1:15:00:: .
Sameness---sameness%1:07:00:: lined the streets---street%1:06:00:: with two story---story%1:06:00:: houses---house%1:06:00:: the color---color%1:07:00:: of ash---ash%1:27:01:: .
It slashed the sloping manure---manure%1:27:00:: scented lawns---lawn%1:15:00:: with concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: steps---steps%1:06:00:: which climbed upward to white wooden porches---porch%1:06:00:: .
It swayed with the wicker---wicker%1:27:00:: swings---swing%1:06:00:: and screeched with the rusted hinges---hinge%1:06:00:: of screen doors---screen_door%1:06:00:: .
Even the stable---stable%1:06:00:: garage---garage%1:06:00:: , which housed nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: now but the scent---scent%1:09:00:: of rot---rot%1:26:00:: , had a lawn---lawn%1:15:00:: before it .
And the coffee shop---coffee_shop%1:06:00:: on Drexel Street---location%1:03:00:: , where the men---man%1:18:00:: spent their evenings---evening%1:28:00:: and Sundays---sunday%1:28:00:: playing cards---card%1:06:00:: , had a rose---rose%1:20:00:: hedge---hedge%1:06:00:: beneath its window---window%1:06:00:: .
The hedge---hedge%1:06:00:: reeked of coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: dregs---dregs%1:17:00:: thrown against it .
Only one house---house%1:06:00:: on the street---street%1:06:00:: had no lawn---lawn%1:15:00:: before it .
It squatted low and square upon the sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: with a heavy iron---iron%1:27:00:: grating---grating%1:06:00:: supporting a glass---glass%1:27:00:: facade---facade%1:06:00:: .
That was Bartoli---person%1:03:00:: 's shop---shop%1:06:00:: .
Above it , from a second story---story%1:06:00:: showroom---showroom%1:06:00:: , wooden angels---angel%1:18:00:: surveyed the neighborhood---neighborhood%1:15:00:: .
Did the Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: remember them there ?
Yet everywhere else sameness---sameness%1:07:00:: was stucco---stucco%1:27:00:: and wood---wood%1:27:00:: in square blocks---square_block%1:06:00:: - like fortresses---fortress%1:06:00:: perched against the slant---slant%1:07:00:: of the hill---hill%1:17:00:: , rising with the hill---hill%1:17:00:: to the top---top%1:15:02:: where the church---church%1:06:00:: was and beyond that to the cemetery---cemetery%1:15:00:: .
Only paved alleyways---alleyway%1:06:00:: tunneled through the walls---wall%1:06:00:: of those fortresses---fortress%1:06:00:: into the mysterious core---core%1:15:00:: of intimacy---intimacy%1:07:02:: behind the houses---house%1:06:00:: where backyards---backyard%1:06:00:: owned no fences---fence%1:06:00:: , where one man---man%1:05:01:: 's property---property%1:21:00:: blended with the next to form courtyards---courtyard%1:06:00:: in which no one knew privacy---privacy%1:07:00:: .
Love---love%1:12:00:: and hatred---hatred%1:12:00:: and fear---fear%1:12:00:: were one---one%1:23:00:: here , shaded only by fig trees---fig_tree%1:20:00:: and grape vines---grapevine%1:10:00:: .
And the forked tongue---tongue%1:08:00:: of gossip---gossip%1:10:01:: licked its sinister way---way%1:04:02:: from back porch---back_porch%1:06:00:: to back porch---back_porch%1:06:00:: .
The Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: silently fed upon these streets---street%1:06:00:: .
It was as though he had made a pact---pact%1:10:00:: with the devil---devil%1:18:02:: himself , but it was not yet time---time%1:28:06:: to pay the price---price%1:21:00:: .
The Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: 's son---son%1:18:00:: threw himself down , belly---belly%1:08:02:: first , upon a concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: step---step%1:06:00:: , taking in the coolness---coolness%1:07:00:: of it , and dreaming of the day---day%1:28:03:: he would be rich .
At fifteen he did n't care that he had no mother---mother%1:18:00:: , that he could n't remember her face---face%1:07:00:: or her touch---touch%1:04:00:: ; neither did he care that Aunt Rose---person%1:03:00:: provided for him .
He was named Pompeii---person%1:03:00:: as a tribute---tribute%1:10:01:: to his heritage---heritage%1:07:00:: , and he could n't have cared less about that either .
To him life---life%1:09:00:: was a restless boredom---boredom%1:12:00:: that began with the rising sun---sun%1:17:00:: and ended only with sleep---sleep%1:26:00:: .
When he would be a man---man%1:18:00:: , he would be a rich man---rich_man%1:18:00:: .
He would not be like the `` rich Americans---american%1:18:00:: '' who lived in white columned houses---house%1:06:00:: on the other side---side%1:15:02:: of the park---park%1:15:01:: .
He would not ride the eight-thirty local---local%1:06:00:: to the city---city%1:15:00:: each morning---morning%1:28:00:: .
He would not carry a brief case---briefcase%1:06:00:: .
He would square his shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: and carry a cane---cane%1:06:01:: before each step---step%1:23:00:: .
He would sit inside the coffee shop---coffee_shop%1:06:00:: and pound a gloved fist---fist%1:08:00:: upon the table---table%1:06:01:: and a girl---girl%1:18:00:: would hear him and come running , bowing with her running---running%1:04:01:: , calling out in her bowing , `` At your service---service%1:04:00:: '' .
He would order her to bring coffee---coffee%1:13:00:: , and would take from his vest pocket---vest_pocket%1:06:00:: a thin black pipe---pipe%1:06:01:: which he would stuff - he would not remove his gloves - and light and smoke .
He could do that when he would be a man---man%1:18:00:: .
`` Hey , Laura---person%1:03:00:: '' ! he called to his sister---sister%1:18:00:: on the porch---porch%1:06:00:: above the steps---steps%1:06:00:: .
She was only ten months---month%1:28:00:: older than he .
`` Laura---person%1:03:00:: , what would you say if I smoked a pipe---pipe%1:06:01:: '' ?
Laura---person%1:03:00:: did not answer him .
She leaned unconcerned against the broken porch---porch%1:06:00:: fence---fence%1:06:00:: , brushing and drying her wet , gilded hair---hair%1:08:00:: in the sun---sun%1:19:00:: .
One lithe leg---leg%1:08:01:: straddled the railing---railing%1:06:00:: and swung loosely before the creaking , torn pales---pale%1:06:00:: .
Her tanned foot---foot%1:08:01:: , whose arch---arch%1:08:00:: swept high and white , pointed artfully toward tapering toes---toe%1:08:01:: - toes---toe%1:08:01:: like fingers---finger%1:08:00:: , whose tips---tip%1:15:00:: glowed white .
All the while---while%1:28:00:: she sat there , her sinewy arms---arm%1:08:00:: swirled before her chest---chest%1:08:00:: .
Her face---face%1:08:00:: showed no sign---sign%1:10:01:: of having heard Pompeii---person%1:03:00:: .
It was a face---face%1:08:00:: that had lost its childlike softness---softness%1:07:00:: and was beginning to fold within its fragile features---feature%1:08:00:: a harshness---harshness%1:07:03:: that belied the lyric lines---line%1:25:00:: of its contours---contour%1:07:00:: .
The eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , blue and always somewhat downcast , possessed a sullen quality---quality%1:07:00:: .
Even though the boy---boy%1:18:00:: could not see them , he knew they were clouded by distance---distance%1:12:00:: .
Pompeii---person%1:03:00:: called again , `` Laura---person%1:03:00:: '' !
But the only answer---answer%1:10:01:: that reached him was the screeching of the porch---porch%1:06:00:: rail---rail%1:06:02:: from her leg---leg%1:08:01:: moving against it .
`` She 's in a mood '' , he thought `` There 's not a month---month%1:28:00:: she does n't get herself in a mood '' .
Well , what did that matter when the sun---sun%1:17:00:: was shining and there were dreams---dream%1:09:01:: to dream about ?
And as for his pipe---pipe%1:06:01:: , if he wanted to smoke one , nobody would stop him .
Not even Laura---person%1:03:00:: .
Suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness---wetness%1:26:00:: lapping against his chin---chin%1:08:00:: , and his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: opened wide and long at the sight---sight%1:09:01:: of a goat---goat%1:05:00:: 's claret---claret%1:07:00:: tongue---tongue%1:08:00:: , feasting against the salt---salt%1:13:00:: taste---taste%1:09:02:: of him .
Above the tongue---tongue%1:08:00:: , an aged yellow eye---eye%1:08:00:: , sallow and time-cast , encrusted within a sphere---sphere%1:26:00:: of marbleized pink skin---skin%1:05:01:: , stared unfalteringly at him .
`` Christ sake , goat---goat%1:05:00:: , git '' !
But the goat---goat%1:05:00:: would not .
`` You 're boiling milk---milk%1:13:01:: , ai n't you '' ? soothing it with his hand---hand%1:08:00:: , knowing the whiskered jowls---jowl%1:08:00:: and the swollen smoothness---smoothness%1:07:00:: of teats---teat%1:08:00:: that wrinkled expectantly to his touch---touch%1:04:00:: .
Pompeii---person%1:03:00:: rolled over .
His head---head%1:08:00:: undulated gradually , covering space---space%1:25:00:: , to come straining beneath the taut belly---belly%1:08:00:: within the warmth---warmth%1:09:00:: of those teats---teat%1:08:00:: .
With his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: opened wide , he squirted the warm white milk---milk%1:13:01:: against the roof---roof_of_the_mouth%1:08:00:: of his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: and his tongue---tongue%1:08:00:: savored the light , earthy taste---taste%1:09:02:: of it .
The boy---boy%1:18:00:: 's fingers---finger%1:08:00:: and mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: operated with the skilled unity---unity%1:26:00:: of a bagpipe---bagpipe%1:06:00:: player---player%1:18:02:: , pressing and pulling , delighting in what he did .
Above him slid the evasive shadow---shadow%1:26:01:: of a storm cloud---storm_cloud%1:17:00:: .
Its form---form%1:07:01:: was a heavy figure---figure%1:25:00:: in a fluttering soutane---soutane%1:06:00:: .
But the boy---boy%1:18:00:: could see only the goat---goat%1:05:00:: 's belly---belly%1:08:00:: .
The Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: near the corner---corner%1:06:00:: let the shadow---shadow%1:26:01:: pass over him , sensing something portentous in it .
He knew it was there , knew also what it was about , but he would n't raise a finger---finger%1:08:00:: except to smooth his yellow dog---dog%1:05:00:: 's back---back%1:08:00:: .
There would be time---time%1:28:05:: enough , perhaps the Old Man---old_man%1:18:02:: reassured himself , to pay the devil---devil%1:18:02:: his due---due%1:07:00:: .
Time---time%1:28:05:: enough to give up his soul---soul%1:18:00:: .
In the meantime , six sandals---sandal%1:06:00:: , stained an ocher---ocher%1:07:00:: , the same color---color%1:07:00:: as Pompeii---person%1:03:00:: 's shaved hair---hair%1:08:00:: , edged up close to him .
The clapping---clapping%1:10:00:: they made on the concrete---concrete%1:27:00:: interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: he knew , so that he quickly released his hold---hold%1:04:00:: on the goat---goat%1:05:00:: and pretended to be examining its haunches---haunch%1:05:00:: for ticks---tick%1:05:00:: .
He knew at a glance---glance%1:04:00:: that the biggest sandals---sandal%1:06:00:: belonged to Niobe---person%1:03:00:: , the neatest ones to Concetta---person%1:03:00:: , and the laced ones to Romeo---person%1:03:00:: , Concetta---person%1:03:00:: 's idiot---idiot%1:18:00:: brother---brother%1:18:00:: .
Pompeii---person%1:03:00:: expected Romeo---person%1:03:00:: 's small body---body%1:08:00:: to sink closer and closer to the ground---ground%1:17:00:: .
He expected Concetta---person%1:03:00:: 's thin hand---hand%1:08:00:: to reach down to grasp the boy---boy%1:18:00:: , and her shrill , impetuous voice---voice%1:07:00:: to sound against the rotundity---rotundity%1:07:00:: of his disfigured flesh---flesh%1:08:02:: that was never sure of hearing anything .
It is not news---news%1:10:00:: that Nathan Milstein---person%1:03:00:: is a wizard---wizard%1:18:01:: of the violin---violin%1:06:00:: .
Certainly not in Orchestra hall---location%1:03:00:: where he has played countless recitals---recital%1:10:03:: , and where Thursday---thursday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: he celebrated his 20th season---season%1:28:02:: with the Chicago Symphony orchestra---group%1:03:00:: , playing the Brahms Concerto with his own slashing , demon-ridden cadenza---cadenza%1:10:00:: melting into the high , pale , pure and lovely song---song%1:10:00:: with which a violinist---violinist%1:18:00:: unlocks the heart---heart%1:09:01:: of the music---music%1:10:00:: , or forever finds it closed .
There was about that song---song%1:10:00:: something incandescent , for this Brahms---location%1:03:00:: was Milstein---person%1:03:00:: at white heat---white_heat%1:07:00:: .
Not the noblest performance---performance%1:10:00:: we have heard him play , or the most spacious , or even the most eloquent .
Those would be reserved for the orchestra---orchestra%1:14:00:: 's great nights---night%1:28:00:: when the soloist---soloist%1:18:00:: can surpass himself .
This time---time%1:11:00:: the orchestra---orchestra%1:14:00:: gave him some superb support---support%1:10:01:: fired by response---response%1:04:01:: to his own high mood---mood%1:12:00:: .
But he had in Walter Hendl---person%1:03:00:: a willing conductor---conductor%1:18:00:: able only up to a point---point%1:26:00:: .
That is , when Mr. Milstein---person%1:03:00:: thrust straight to the core---core%1:15:00:: of the music---music%1:09:00:: , sparks---spark%1:19:00:: flying , bow---bow%1:06:00:: shredding , violin---violin%1:06:00:: singing---singing%1:04:00:: , glittering and sometimes spitting , Mr. Hendl---person%1:03:00:: could go along .
But Mr. Hendl---person%1:03:00:: does not go straight to any point---point%1:26:00:: .
He flounders and lets music---music%1:09:00:: sprawl .
There was in the Brahms---person%1:03:00:: none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor---conductor%1:18:00:: can bring soloist---soloist%1:18:00:: , orchestra---orchestra%1:14:00:: and music---music%1:09:00:: to ultimate fusion---fusion%1:11:00:: .
So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein---person%1:03:00:: , but not great Brahms---person%1:03:00:: .
The concert---concert%1:10:00:: opened with another big romantic score---score%1:10:00:: , Schumann's---person%1:03:00:: Overture to Manfred , which suffered fate---fate%1:18:00:: , this time---time%1:11:00:: with orchestral thrusts---thrust%1:19:00:: to the Byronic point---point%1:26:00:: to keep it afloat .
Hindemith---person%1:03:00:: 's joust---joust%1:11:00:: with Weber---person%1:03:00:: tunes---tune%1:10:00:: was a considerably more serious misfortune---misfortune%1:11:00:: , for it demands translucent textures---texture%1:07:00:: , buoyant rhythms---rhythm%1:10:01:: , and astringent wit---wit%1:10:00:: .
It got the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of scrambled , coarsened performance---performance%1:10:00:: that can happen to best of orchestras---orchestra%1:14:00:: when the man---man%1:18:00:: with the baton---baton%1:06:00:: lacks technique---technique%1:09:01:: and style---style%1:10:00:: .
The Bayreuth Festival opens July---july%1:28:00:: 23 with a new production---production%1:10:00:: of `` Tannhaeuser '' staged by Wieland Wagner---person%1:03:00:: , who is doing all the operas---opera%1:10:00:: this time---time%1:11:00:: , and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch---person%1:03:00:: .
Sawalisch---person%1:03:00:: also conducts `` The Flying Dutch '' , opening July---july%1:28:00:: 24 .
`` Parsifal '' follows July---july%1:28:00:: 25 , with Hans Knappertsbusch---person%1:03:00:: conducting , and he also conducts `` Die Meistersinger '' , to be presented Aug.---aug%1:28:00:: 8 and 12 .
The `` Ring '' cycles---cycle%1:14:00:: are July---july%1:28:00:: 26 , 27 , 28 and 30 , and Aug.---aug%1:28:00:: 21 , 22 , 23 and 25 .
Rudolf Kempe---person%1:03:00:: conducts .
No casts---cast%1:14:00:: are listed , but Lotte Lehmann---person%1:03:00:: sent word that the Negro soprano---soprano%1:18:00:: , Grace Bumbry---person%1:03:00:: , will sing Venus---venus%1:18:00:: in `` Tannhaeuser '' .
Remember how BY a series---series%1:14:00:: of booking---booking%1:04:00:: absurdities---absurdity%1:10:00:: Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet---group%1:03:00:: ?
Remember how by lack---lack%1:26:00:: of two big theaters---theater%1:06:00:: Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: missed the first visit---visit%1:04:02:: of the Royal Danish Ballet---group%1:03:00:: ?
Well , now we have two big theaters---theater%1:06:00:: .
But barring a miracle---miracle%1:11:00:: , and do n't hold your breath---breath%1:04:00:: for it , Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: will not see the Leningrad-Kirov Ballet---group%1:03:00:: , which stems from the ballet---ballet%1:04:00:: cradle---cradle%1:15:00:: of the Maryinsky---group%1:03:00:: and is one of the great companies---company%1:14:02:: of the world .
Before you let loose a howl---howl%1:10:00:: saying we announced its coming---coming%1:04:02:: , not once but several times---time%1:11:00:: , indeed we did .
The engagement---engagement%1:14:00:: was supposed to be all set for the big theater---theater%1:06:00:: in McCormick Place---location%1:03:00:: , which Sol Hurok---person%1:03:00:: , ballet---ballet%1:04:00:: booker---booker%1:18:00:: extraordinary , considers the finest house---house%1:14:03:: of its kind---kind%1:09:00:: in the country---country%1:15:00:: - and of course he does n't weep at the capacity---capacity%1:23:00:: , either .
Allied Arts---group%1:03:00:: corporation---corporation%1:14:00:: first listed the Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: dates---date%1:28:00:: as Dec.---dec%1:28:00:: 4 thru 10 .
Later the Hurok---person%1:03:00:: office---office%1:14:01:: made it Dec.---dec%1:28:00:: 8 thru 17 , a nice , long booking---booking%1:04:01:: for the full repertory---repertory%1:06:00:: .
But if you keep a calendar---calendar%1:10:01:: of events---event%1:03:00:: , as we do , you noticed a conflict---conflict%1:07:00:: .
Allied Arts---group%1:03:00:: had booked Marlene Dietrich---person%1:03:00:: into McCormick Place---location%1:03:00:: Dec.---dec%1:28:00:: 8 and 9 .
Not La Dietrich---person%1:03:00:: .
Allied Arts---group%1:03:00:: then notified us that the Kirov---group%1:03:00:: would cut short its Los Angeles---los_angeles%1:15:00:: booking---booking%1:04:01:: , fly here to open Nov.---nov%1:28:00:: 28 , and close Dec.---dec%1:28:00:: 2 .
Shorter booking---booking%1:04:01:: , but still a booking---booking%1:04:01:: .
A couple of days---day%1:28:00:: later a balletomane---balletomane%1:18:00:: told me he had telephoned Allied Arts---group%1:03:00:: for ticket---ticket%1:10:01:: information---information%1:10:00:: and was told `` the newspapers---newspaper%1:10:00:: had made a mistake---mistake%1:04:00:: '' .
So I started making some calls---call%1:10:01:: of my own .
These are the results---result%1:10:00:: .
The Kirov Ballet---group%1:03:00:: is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium---location%1:03:00:: , Los Angeles---los_angeles%1:15:00:: , Nov.---nov%1:28:00:: 21 thru Dec.---dec%1:28:00:: 4 .
Not a chance---chance%1:26:00:: of opening here Nov.---nov%1:28:00:: 28 - barring that miracle---miracle%1:11:00:: .
Then why not the juicy booking---booking%1:04:01:: Hurok---person%1:03:00:: had held for us ?
Well , Dietrich---person%1:03:00:: won't budge from McCormick Place---group%1:03:00:: .
Then how about the Civic Opera house---group%1:03:00:: ?
Well , Allied Arts---group%1:03:00:: has booked Lena Horne---person%1:03:00:: there for a week---week%1:28:00:: starting Dec.---dec%1:28:00:: 4 .
Queried about the impasse---impasse%1:26:00:: , Allied Arts---group%1:03:00:: said : `` Better cancel the Kirov---group%1:03:00:: for the time being .
So the Kirov---group%1:03:00:: will fly back to Russia---russia%1:15:00:: , minus a Chicago---chicago%1:15:00:: engagement---engagement%1:04:02:: , a serious loss---loss%1:07:00:: for dance---dance%1:10:00:: fans---fan%1:18:00:: - and for the frustrated bookers---booker%1:18:00:: , cancellation---cancellation%1:04:00:: of one of the richest bookings---booking%1:04:01:: in the country---country%1:15:00:: .
Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium---auditorium%1:06:00:: ?
Paintings---painting%1:06:00:: and drawings---drawing%1:06:00:: by Marie Moore---person%1:03:00:: of St. Thomas---location%1:03:00:: , Virgin Islands---virgin_islands%1:15:00:: , are shown thru Nov.---nov%1:28:00:: 5 at the Meadows gallery---location%1:03:00:: , 3211 Ellis Ave.---location%1:03:00:: , week days---weekday%1:28:00:: , 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. , Sundays---sunday%1:28:00:: 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. , closed Mondays---monday%1:28:00:: .
An exhibition---exhibition%1:14:00:: of Evelyn Cibula---person%1:03:00:: 's paintings---painting%1:06:00:: will open with a reception---reception%1:14:00:: Nov.---nov%1:28:00:: 5 at the Evanston Community center---location%1:03:00:: , 828 Davis st.---location%1:03:00:: .
It will continue all month---month%1:28:01:: .
Abstractions---abstraction%1:06:00:: and semi abstractions---abstraction%1:06:00:: by Everett McNear---person%1:03:00:: are being exhibited by the University gallery of Notre Dame---location%1:03:00:: until Nov.---nov%1:28:00:: 5 .
In the line---line%1:14:02:: of operatic trades---trade%1:04:02:: to cushion the budget---budget%1:21:02:: , the Dallas Civic Opera---group%1:03:00:: will use San Francisco---san_francisco%1:15:00:: 's new Leni Bauer-Ecsy---group%1:03:00:: production---production%1:10:00:: of `` Lucia di Lammermoor '' this season---season%1:28:02:: , returning the favor---favor%1:04:00:: next season---season%1:28:02:: when San Francisco---san_francisco%1:15:00:: uses the Dallas---dallas%1:15:00:: `` Don Giovanni '' , designed by Franco Zeffirelli---person%1:03:00:: .
H. E. Bates---person%1:03:00:: has scribbled a farce---farce%1:10:00:: called `` Hark , Hark , the Lark '' !
It is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels---novel%1:10:00:: of the season---season%1:28:02:: .
If there is a moral---moral%1:10:00:: lurking among the shenanigans---shenanigan%1:04:00:: , it is hard to find .
Perhaps the lesson---lesson%1:10:01:: we should take from these pages---page%1:10:00:: is that the welfare state---welfare_state%1:14:00:: in England---england%1:15:00:: still allows wild scope---scope%1:07:00:: for all kinds---kind%1:09:00:: of rugged eccentrics---eccentric%1:18:00:: .
Anyway , a number---number%1:07:00:: of them meet here in devastating collisions---collision%1:11:01:: .
One is an imperial London---london%1:15:00:: stockbroker---stockbroker%1:18:00:: called Jerebohm---person%1:03:00:: .
Another is a wily countryman---countryman%1:18:00:: called Larkin---person%1:03:00:: , whose blandly boisterous progress---progress%1:04:00:: has been chronicled , I believe , in earlier volumes---volume%1:10:00:: of Mr. Bates---person%1:03:00:: ' comedie humaine .
Well , Jerebohm---person%1:03:00:: and his wife---wife%1:18:00:: Pinkie---person%1:03:00:: have reached the stage---stage%1:26:00:: of affluence---affluence%1:26:00:: that stirs a longing---longing%1:12:00:: for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities---simplicity%1:07:02:: .
They want to own a junior-grade castle---castle%1:06:02:: , or a manor house---manor_house%1:06:00:: , or some modest little place---place%1:15:04:: where Shakespeare---shakespeare%1:18:00:: might once have staged a pageant---pageant%1:04:00:: for Great Elizabeth---person%1:03:00:: and all her bearded courtiers---courtier%1:18:00:: .
They are willing to settle , however , in anything that offers pheasants---pheasant%1:05:00:: to shoot at and peasants---peasant%1:18:00:: to work at .
And of course Larkin---person%1:03:00:: has just the thing---thing%1:06:00:: they want .
It 's a horror---horror%1:06:00:: .
The name---name%1:10:00:: of it is Gore Court---location%1:03:00:: , and it is surrounded by a wasteland---wasteland%1:15:00:: that would impress T. S. Eliot---person%1:03:00:: .
That 's not precisely the way---way%1:07:01:: Larkin---person%1:03:00:: urges them to look at it , though .
He conjures herds---herd%1:14:01:: of deer---deer%1:05:00:: , and wild birds---bird%1:05:00:: crowding the air---air%1:15:00:: .
He suggests that Gore Court---location%1:03:00:: embodies all the glories---glory%1:07:00:: of Tudor---tudor%1:14:00:: splendor---splendor%1:07:01:: .
The stained-glass windows---stained-glass_window%1:06:00:: may have developed unpremeditated patinas---patina%1:06:00:: , the paneling---paneling%1:06:00:: may be no more durable than the planks---plank%1:27:00:: in a political platform---political_platform%1:10:00:: .
The vast , dungeon---dungeon%1:06:00:: kitchens---kitchen%1:06:00:: may seem hardly worth using except on occasions---occasion%1:11:00:: when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests---guest%1:18:00:: for lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: .
Larkin---person%1:03:00:: has an answer---answer%1:10:02:: to all that .
The spaciousness---spaciousness%1:07:00:: of the Tudor---tudor%1:14:00:: cooking areas---area%1:06:00:: , for example , will provide needed space---space%1:03:00:: for the extra television sets---television_set%1:06:00:: required by modern butlers---butler%1:18:00:: , cooks---cook%1:18:00:: and maids---maid%1:18:01:: .
Also , perhaps , table-tennis---table_tennis%1:04:00:: and other indoor sports---sport%1:04:00:: to keep them fit and contented .
It 's a wonder---wonder%1:11:00:: , really , to how much mendacious trouble---trouble%1:11:01:: Larkin---person%1:03:00:: puts himself to sell the Jerebohms---person%1:03:00:: that preposterous manse---manse%1:06:01:: .
He does n't really need the immense sum of money---sum_of_money%1:21:00:: ( probably converted from American gold---gold%1:21:00:: on the London Exchange---group%1:03:00:: ) he makes them pay .
For Larkin---person%1:03:00:: is already wonderfully contented with his lot---lot%1:26:00:: .
He has a glorious wife---wife%1:18:00:: and many children---child%1:18:01:: .
When he needs money---money%1:21:00:: to buy something like , say , the Rolls-Royce he keeps near his vegetable patch---vegetable_patch%1:06:00:: , he takes a flyer in the sale---sale%1:04:00:: of surplus army---army%1:14:00:: supplies .
One of those capital-gains---capital_gain%1:21:00:: ventures---venture%1:21:00:: , in fact , has saddled him with Gore Court---location%1:03:00:: .
And the Jerebohms---person%1:03:00:: are more than willing to buy it .
They plan to become county---county%1:15:00:: people---people%1:14:00:: who know the proper way---way%1:04:01:: to terminate a fox---fox%1:05:00:: 's life---life%1:26:00:: on earth---earth%1:17:00:: .
If , in Larkin---person%1:03:00:: 's eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , they are nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: but Piccadilly---location%1:03:00:: farmers---farmer%1:18:00:: , he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways---way%1:04:00:: of truly rural living---living%1:09:00:: .
Mr. Bates---person%1:03:00:: shows us how this mutual education---education%1:09:00:: spreads its inevitable havoc---havoc%1:04:00:: .
Oneupmanship---one-upmanship%1:04:00:: is practiced by both sides---side%1:14:00:: in a total war---war%1:04:00:: .
First the Larkins---person%1:03:00:: are ahead , then the Jerebohms---person%1:03:00:: .
After Larkin---person%1:03:00:: has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres---acres%1:21:00:: with pheasants---pheasant%1:05:00:: , he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment---nourishment%1:13:00:: of his family---family%1:14:00:: and local callers---caller%1:18:00:: .
One of the local callers---caller%1:18:00:: , a retired brigadier---brigadier%1:18:00:: apparently left over from Kipling---kipling%1:18:00:: 's tales---tale%1:10:00:: of India---india%1:15:00:: , does not approve of the way---way%1:07:01:: Larkin---person%1:03:00:: gets his birds---bird%1:05:00:: .
He does n't think that potting them from a deck chair---deck_chair%1:06:00:: on the south side---south_side%1:15:00:: of the house---house%1:06:00:: with a quart---quart%1:23:01:: glass---glass%1:06:00:: of beer---beer%1:13:00:: for sustenance---sustenance%1:13:00:: is entirely sporting .
But the brigadier---brigadier%1:18:00:: dines on the birds---bird%1:13:00:: with relish---relish%1:12:02:: .
It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film---film%1:10:01:: yet made from Miguel de Cervantes---person%1:03:00:: ' `` Don Quixote---don_quixote%1:18:01:: '' is the brilliant Russian spectacle---spectacle%1:06:00:: , done in wide screen and color---color%1:07:00:: , which opened yesterday---yesterday%1:28:01:: at the Fifty-fifth Street---location%1:03:00:: and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses---group%1:03:00:: .
More than a beautiful visualization---visualization%1:09:00:: of the illustrious adventures---adventure%1:04:00:: and escapades---escapade%1:04:01:: of the tragi-comic knight-errant---knight-errant%1:18:00:: and his squire---squire%1:18:01:: , Sancho Panza---person%1:03:00:: , in seventeenth century---century%1:28:00:: Spain---spain%1:15:00:: , this inevitably abbreviated rendering---rendering%1:04:01:: of the classic satire---satire%1:10:00:: on chivalry---chivalry%1:07:00:: is an affectingly warm and human exposition---exposition%1:10:00:: of character---character%1:07:01:: .
Nikolai Cherkasov---person%1:03:00:: , the Russian actor---actor%1:18:00:: who has played such heroic roles---role%1:09:00:: as Alexander Nevsky---person%1:03:00:: and Ivan the Terrible---person%1:03:00:: , performs the lanky Don Quixote---don_quixote%1:18:01:: , and does so with a simple dignity---dignity%1:07:00:: that bridges the inner nobility---nobility%1:07:00:: and the surface absurdity---absurdity%1:10:00:: of this poignant man---man%1:18:00:: .
His addle-brained knight-errant---knight-errant%1:18:00:: , self---self%1:18:00:: appointed to the ridiculous position---position%1:04:01:: in an age---age%1:28:02:: when armor---armor%1:06:00:: had already been relegated to museums---museum%1:06:00:: and the chivalrous code---code%1:10:01:: of knight-errantry---knight_errantry%1:07:00:: had become a joke---joke%1:10:00:: , is , as Cervantes---person%1:03:00:: no doubt intended , a gaunt but gracious symbol---symbol%1:10:00:: of good , moving soberly and sincerely in a world---world%1:14:01:: of cynics---cynic%1:18:00:: , hypocrites---hypocrite%1:18:00:: and rogues---rogue%1:18:00:: .
Cherkasov---person%1:03:00:: does not caricature him , as some actors---actor%1:18:00:: have been inclined to do .
He treats this deep-eyed , bearded , bony crackpot---crackpot%1:18:00:: with tangible affection---affection%1:12:00:: and respect---respect%1:04:03:: .
Directed by Grigory Kozintsev---person%1:03:00:: in a tempo---tempo%1:28:01:: that is studiously slow , he develops a sense---sense%1:09:02:: of a high tradition---tradition%1:09:01:: shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world---world%1:14:01:: .
The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case---case%1:11:00:: by appropriately stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian dialogue .
The complexities---complexity%1:07:00:: of communication---communication%1:03:00:: have been considerably abetted in this case---case%1:26:00:: by appropriately stilted English language---english_language%1:10:00:: that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian---russian%1:10:00:: dialogue---dialogue%1:10:00:: .
The voices---voice%1:07:00:: of all the characters---character%1:09:01:: , including that of Cherkasov---person%1:03:00:: , have richness---richness%1:07:01:: , roughness---roughness%1:07:01:: or color---color%1:07:02:: to conform with the personalities---personality%1:07:00:: .
And the subtleties---subtlety%1:07:00:: of the dialogue---dialogue%1:10:01:: are most helpfully conveyed .
Since Russian---russian%1:10:00:: was being spoken instead of Spanish---spanish%1:10:00:: , there is no violation---violation%1:04:01:: of artistry---artistry%1:09:00:: or logic---logic%1:09:00:: here .
Splendid , too , is the performance---performance%1:04:01:: of Yuri Tolubeyev---person%1:03:00:: , one of Russia---russia%1:15:00:: 's leading comedians---comedian%1:18:00:: , as Sancho Panza---person%1:03:00:: , the fat , grotesque `` squire---squire%1:18:01:: '' .
Though his character---character%1:09:01:: is broader and more comically rounded than the don---don%1:18:01:: , he gives it a firmness---firmness%1:07:03:: and toughness---toughness%1:07:01:: - a sort of peasant---peasant%1:18:00:: dignity---dignity%1:07:00:: - too .
It is really as though the Russians---russian%1:18:00:: have seen in this character---character%1:09:01:: the oftentimes underlying vitality---vitality%1:07:01:: and courage---courage%1:07:00:: of supposed buffoons---buffoon%1:18:01:: .
The episode---episode%1:10:01:: in which Sancho Panza---person%1:03:00:: concludes the joke---joke%1:04:00:: that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command---command%1:07:00:: of an `` island---island%1:17:00:: '' is one of the best in the film---film%1:10:01:: .
True , the pattern---pattern%1:09:00:: and flow---flow%1:22:00:: of the drama---drama%1:10:01:: have strong literary qualities---quality%1:07:00:: that are a bit wearisome in the first half---first_half%1:28:00:: , before Don Quixote---don_quixote%1:18:01:: goes to the duke---duke%1:18:00:: 's court---court%1:14:01:: .
But strength---strength%1:07:01:: and poignancy---poignancy%1:26:00:: develop thenceforth , and the windmill---windmill%1:06:01:: and deathbed---deathbed%1:28:00:: episodes---episode%1:10:01:: gather the threads---thread%1:06:00:: of realization---realization%1:04:00:: of the wonderfulness---wonderfulness%1:07:00:: of the old boy---old_boy%1:18:00:: .
There are other good representations---representation%1:06:00:: of peasants---peasant%1:18:00:: and people---people%1:14:00:: of the court---court%1:14:01:: by actors---actor%1:18:00:: who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films---film%1:10:01:: to reach this country---country%1:14:00:: in the program---program%1:09:00:: of joint cultural exchange---exchange%1:04:02:: .
Also on the bill---bill%1:04:00:: at the Fifty-fifth Street---location%1:03:00:: is a nice ten minute---minute%1:28:00:: color---color%1:07:00:: film---film%1:10:01:: called `` Sunday in Greenwich Village '' , a tour---tour%1:04:00:: of the haunts---haunt%1:15:00:: and joints---joint%1:06:02:: .
It was not as though she noted clearly that her nephews---nephew%1:18:00:: had not been to see her for ten years---year%1:28:01:: , not since their last journey---journey%1:04:00:: eastward to witness their Uncle Izaak---person%1:03:00:: being lowered into the rocky soil---soil%1:27:01:: ; that aside from due notification---notification%1:04:02:: of certain major events---event%1:03:00:: in their lives---life%1:28:01:: ( two marriages---marriage%1:26:00:: , two births---birth%1:11:00:: , one divorce---divorce%1:04:00:: ) , Christmas---christmas_card%1:10:00:: and Easter cards---easter_card%1:10:00:: of the traditional sort---sort%1:09:00:: had been the only thin link---link%1:06:00:: she had with them through the widowed years---year%1:28:01:: .
Her thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: were not discrete .
But there was a look---look%1:07:01:: about her mouth---mouth%1:08:00:: as though she were tasting lemons---lemon%1:13:00:: .
She grasped the chair---chair%1:06:00:: arms---arm%1:06:02:: and brought her thin body---body%1:08:00:: upright , like a bird---bird%1:05:00:: alert for flight---flight%1:04:00:: .
She turned and walked stiffly into the parlor---parlor%1:06:00:: to the dainty legged escritoire---escritoire%1:06:00:: , warped and cracked now from fifty years---year%1:28:01:: in an atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:00:: of sea spray---sea_spray%1:27:00:: .
There she extracted two limp vellum---vellum%1:27:01:: sheets---sheet%1:10:00:: and wrote off the letters---letter%1:10:00:: , one to Abel---person%1:03:00:: , one to Mark---person%1:03:00:: .
Once her trembling hand---hand%1:08:00:: , with the pen---pen%1:06:00:: grasped tight in it , was pressed against the paper---paper%1:10:00:: the words---word%1:10:00:: came sharply , smoothly , as authoritatively as they would dropping from her own lips---lip%1:08:00:: .
And the stiffly regal look---look%1:07:00:: of them , she saw grimly , lacked the quaver---quaver%1:11:00:: of age---age%1:07:00:: which , thwarting the efforts---effort%1:04:00:: of her amazing will---will%1:09:01:: , ran through her spoken words---spoken_word%1:10:00:: like a thin ragged string---string%1:06:00:: .
`` Please come down as soon as you conveniently can '' , the upright letters---letter%1:10:00:: stalked from the broad nibbed pen---pen%1:06:00:: , `` I have an important matter---matter%1:09:00:: to discuss with you '' .
To Abel---person%1:03:00:: :
`` I am afraid there is not much---much%1:23:00:: to amuse small children---child%1:18:00:: here .
I should be obliged if you could make other arrangements---arrangement%1:09:01:: for your daughters---daughter%1:18:00:: .
You may stay as long as you wish---wish%1:12:00:: , of course , but if arranging for the care---care%1:04:02:: of the girls---girl%1:18:02:: must take time---time%1:03:00:: into account , I think a day---day%1:28:00:: or two should be enough to finish our business---business%1:09:00:: in '' .
To Mark---person%1:03:00:: : `` Please give my regards---regard%1:10:00:: to Myra---person%1:03:00:: '' .
She signed the letters---letter%1:10:00:: quickly , stamped them , and placed them on the hall---hall%1:06:05:: table---table%1:06:01:: for Raphael---person%1:03:00:: to mail in town---town%1:15:00:: .
Then she went back to the wicker---wicker%1:27:00:: chair---chair%1:06:00:: and resolutely adjusted her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: to the glare---glare%1:07:00:: on the water---water%1:27:00:: .
`` My nephews---nephew%1:18:00:: will be coming down '' , she said that evening---evening%1:28:00:: as Angelina---person%1:03:00:: brought her dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: into the dining room---dining_room%1:06:00:: , the whole meal---meal%1:13:00:: on a vast linen---linen%1:27:00:: covered tray---tray%1:06:00:: .
She looked at the girl---girl%1:18:02:: speculatively from eyes---eye%1:08:00:: which had paled with the years---years%1:28:00:: ; from the early evening---evening%1:28:00:: lights---light%1:07:01:: of them which had first startled Izaak---person%1:03:00:: to look at her in an uncousinly way---way%1:07:01:: , they had faded to a near absence---absence%1:04:00:: of color---color%1:07:00:: which had , possibly from her constant looking at---looking_at%1:04:00:: the water---water%1:27:00:: , something of the light---light%1:07:01:: of the sea---sea%1:17:00:: in them .
Angelina---person%1:03:00:: placed the tray---tray%1:06:00:: on the table---table%1:06:01:: and with a flick---flick%1:11:00:: of dark wrist---wrist%1:08:00:: drew off the cloth---cloth%1:06:00:: .
She smiled , and the teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: gleamed in her beautifully modeled olive face---face%1:08:00:: .
`` That will be so nice for you , Mrs. Packard---person%1:03:00:: '' , she said .
Her voice---voice%1:07:00:: was ripe and full and her teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: flashed again in Sicilian brilliance---brilliance%1:07:00:: before the warm curved lips---lip%1:08:00:: met and her mouth---mouth%1:08:00:: settled in repose---repose%1:04:00:: .
`` Um '' , said the old lady---lady%1:18:02:: , and brought her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: down to the tray---tray%1:06:00:: .
She glinted suspiciously at the dish---dish%1:13:00:: before her : `` Blowfish---blowfish%1:13:00:: .
I hope Raphael---person%1:03:00:: bought them whole '' .
Angelina---person%1:03:00:: stepped back , her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: roaming the tray---tray%1:06:00:: for omissions---omission%1:26:00:: .
Then she looked at the old woman---old_woman%1:18:00:: again , her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: calm .
`` Yes---yes%1:10:00:: '' , she said , `` I remember that they came here every summer---summer%1:28:00:: .
Abel---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
The name---name%1:10:00:: fell with lazy affectionate remembrance---remembrance%1:09:00:: from her lips---lip%1:08:00:: .
For an instant---instant%1:28:01:: the old aunt---aunt%1:18:00:: felt something indefinable flash through her smile---smile%1:10:00:: .
She would have said triumph---triumph%1:12:00:: .
Then Angelina---person%1:03:00:: turned and with an easy grace---grace%1:07:01:: walked toward the kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: .
Jessica Packard---person%1:03:00:: lifted her head---head%1:08:00:: and followed the retreating figure---figure%1:08:00:: , her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: resting nearly closed on the unself-conscious rise---rise%1:04:00:: and fall---fall%1:04:01:: of the rounded hips---hip%1:08:00:: .
For a moment---moment%1:28:01:: she held her face---face%1:08:00:: to the empty doorway---doorway%1:06:00:: ; then she snorted and groped for her fork---fork%1:06:00:: .
There 's no greater catastrophe---catastrophe%1:11:00:: in the universe---universe%1:17:00:: , she reflected dourly , impaling tender green beans---green_bean%1:13:00:: on the silver---silver%1:27:00:: fork---fork%1:06:00:: , than the dwindling away---dwindling_away%1:11:00:: of a family---family%1:14:00:: .
Procreation---procreation%1:04:00:: , expansion---expansion%1:04:00:: , proliferation---proliferation%1:22:00:: - these are the laws---law%1:09:00:: of living things---living_thing%1:03:00:: , with the penalty---penalty%1:04:00:: for not obeying them the ultimate in punishments---punishment%1:04:00:: : oblivion---oblivion%1:26:00:: .
When the fate---fate%1:11:00:: of the individual---individual%1:03:00:: is visited on the group---group%1:03:00:: , then ( the warm sweet butter---butter%1:13:00:: dripped from her raised trembling fork---fork%1:06:00:: and she pushed her head---head%1:08:00:: forward belligerently ) , ah , then the true bitterness---bitterness%1:12:00:: of existence---existence%1:26:00:: could be tasted .
And indeed the young garden---garden%1:14:00:: beans---bean%1:13:00:: were brackish in her mouth---mouth%1:08:00:: .
She was the last living---living%1:14:00:: of the older generation---generation%1:14:01:: .
What had once been a widespread family---family%1:14:02:: - at one time---time%1:11:00:: , she knew , there were enough Packards---person%1:03:00:: to populate an entire county---county%1:15:00:: - had now narrowed down to the two boys---boy%1:18:00:: , Abel---person%1:03:00:: and Mark---person%1:03:00:: .
She swung her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: up to the blue---blue%1:07:00:: of the window---window%1:06:00:: , her jaws---jaw%1:08:00:: gently mashing the bitter beans---bean%1:13:00:: .
What hope lay in the nephews---nephew%1:18:00:: , she asked the intensifying light---light%1:19:00:: out there , with one married to a barren woman---woman%1:18:00:: and the other divorced , having sired two girl---girl%1:18:02:: children---child%1:18:01:: , with none to bear on the Packard---person%1:03:00:: name---name%1:14:00:: ?
It seemed to her , as it seemed each night---night%1:28:00:: , that the gloom---gloom%1:26:01:: drew itself in and became densest at the table---table%1:06:01:: 's empty chairs---chair%1:06:00:: , giving her the frequent illusion---illusion%1:09:00:: that she dined with shadows---shadow%1:15:00:: .
Here , too , she talked low , quirking her head---head%1:08:00:: at one or another of the places---place%1:15:00:: , most often at Izaak---person%1:03:00:: 's armchair---armchair%1:06:00:: which faced her across the long table---table%1:06:01:: .
Or it might have been the absent nephews---nephew%1:18:00:: she addressed , consciously playing with the notion---notion%1:09:01:: that this was one of the summers---summer%1:28:00:: of their early years---years%1:28:00:: .
She thought again of her children---child%1:18:01:: , those two who had died young , before the later science which might have saved them could attach even a label---label%1:10:01:: to their separate malignancies---malignancy%1:26:00:: .
The girl---girl%1:18:02:: , her first---first%1:24:00:: , she barely remembered .
It could have been anyone 's infant---infant%1:18:00:: , for it had not survived the bassinet---bassinet%1:06:00:: .
But the boy---boy%1:18:00:: , the boy---boy%1:18:00:: had been alive yesterday---yesterday%1:28:01:: .
Each successive movement---movement%1:11:00:: in his growing---growing%1:22:00:: was recorded on the unreeling film---film%1:06:01:: inside her .
He ran on his plump sticks of legs---leg%1:08:01:: , freezing now and again into the sudden startled attitudes---attitude%1:07:01:: which the camera---camera%1:06:00:: had caught and held on the paling photographs---photograph%1:06:00:: , all carefully placed and glued and labeled , resting in the fat plush album---album%1:06:00:: in the bottom---bottom%1:15:00:: drawer---drawer%1:06:00:: of the escritoire---escritoire%1:06:00:: .
In the cruel clearness---clearness%1:07:01:: of her memory---memory%1:09:01:: the boy---boy%1:18:00:: remained unchanged , quick with the delight---delight%1:12:00:: of laughter---laughter%1:10:00:: , and the pain---pain%1:12:00:: with which she recalled that short destroyed childhood---childhood%1:28:00:: was still unendurable to her .
It was one with the desolate rocks---rock%1:17:01:: and the alien water---water%1:27:00:: on those days---day%1:28:03:: when she hated the sea---sea%1:17:00:: .
The brothers---brother%1:18:00:: drove down together in Mark---person%1:03:00:: 's small red sports car---sports_car%1:06:00:: , Mark---person%1:03:00:: at the wheel .
Abel---person%1:03:00:: sat and regarded the farm country---country%1:15:01:: which , spreading out from both sides---side%1:15:02:: of the road---road%1:06:00:: , rolled greenly up to where the silent white houses---house%1:06:00:: and long barns---barn%1:06:00:: and silos---silo%1:06:00:: nested into the tilled fields---field%1:15:00:: .
He saw the land---land%1:17:01:: with a stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: 's eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , all the old familiarness gone .
And it presented itself to him as it would to any stranger---stranger%1:18:00:: , impervious , complete in itself .
There was stability---stability%1:07:00:: there , too - a color---color%1:07:00:: which his life---life%1:26:02:: had had once .
That is what childhood---childhood%1:28:00:: is , he told himself .
In the stiff neutral lines---line%1:06:00:: of the telephone poles---telephone_pole%1:06:00:: he saw the no-nonsense pen---pen%1:06:00:: strokes---stroke%1:11:00:: of Aunt Jessica---person%1:03:00:: 's letter---letter%1:10:00:: .
What bad grace---grace%1:07:00:: , what incredible selfishness---selfishness%1:07:00:: he and Mark---person%1:03:00:: had shown .
The boyhood---boyhood%1:28:00:: summers---summer%1:28:00:: preceding their uncle---uncle%1:18:00:: 's funeral---funeral%1:11:00:: might never have been .
They had closed over , absolutely , with the sealing---sealing%1:04:00:: of old Izaak---person%1:03:00:: 's grave---grave%1:06:00:: .
The small car---car%1:06:00:: flew on relentlessly .
The old woman---old_woman%1:18:00:: , stubbornly reigning in the house---house%1:06:00:: above the crashing waters---water%1:17:00:: took on an ominous reality---reality%1:09:00:: .
Abel---person%1:03:00:: moved and adjusted his long legs---leg%1:08:01:: .
`` I suppose it has to do with the property---property%1:21:00:: '' , Mark---person%1:03:00:: had said over the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: when they had discussed their receipt---receipt%1:04:00:: of the letters---letter%1:10:00:: .
Not until the words---word%1:10:00:: had been spoken did Abel---person%1:03:00:: suddenly see the old house---house%1:06:00:: and the insistent sea---sea%1:17:00:: , and feel his contrition---contrition%1:12:00:: blotted out in one shameful moment---moment%1:28:01:: of covetousness---covetousness%1:12:01:: .
He and Mark---person%1:03:00:: were the last of the family---family%1:14:02:: , and there lay the Cape Ann---location%1:03:00:: property---property%1:21:00:: which had seemed to have no end , stretching from horizon---horizon%1:15:00:: to horizon---horizon%1:15:00:: , in those golden days---day%1:28:03:: of summer---summer%1:28:00:: .
Now Abel---person%1:03:00:: turned his head---head%1:08:00:: to look at his brother---brother%1:18:00:: .
Mark---person%1:03:00:: held the wheel---wheel%1:06:05:: loosely , but his fingers---finger%1:08:00:: curved around it in a purposeful way---way%1:07:01:: and the deliberate set---set%1:09:01:: of his body---body%1:08:00:: spoke plainly of the figure---figure%1:08:00:: he 'd make in the years---years%1:28:00:: to come .
His sandy hair---hair%1:08:00:: was already beginning to thin and recede at the sides---side%1:15:02:: , and Abel---person%1:03:00:: looked quickly away .
Mark---person%1:03:00:: easily looked years---years%1:28:00:: older than himself , settled , his world---world%1:09:00:: comfortably categorized .
The vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: traffic---traffic%1:14:00:: was becoming heavier as they approached the sea---sea%1:17:00:: .
`` She did n't mention bringing Myra---person%1:03:00:: '' , Mark---person%1:03:00:: said , maneuvering the car---car%1:06:00:: into the next lane---lane%1:06:01:: .
But Myra---person%1:03:00:: would n't budge without an express invitation---invitation%1:10:00:: .
He gave Abel---person%1:03:00:: a quick glance---glance%1:04:00:: and moved closer to the wheel---wheel%1:06:05:: , hugging it to him , and Abel---person%1:03:00:: caught this briefest of allusions---allusion%1:10:00:: to guilt---guilt%1:12:00:: .
`` I imagine the old girl---girl%1:18:03:: has n't missed us much '' , Mark---location%1:03:00:: added , his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: on the road---road%1:06:00:: .
Abel---person%1:03:00:: ignored the half expressed bid---bid%1:10:03:: for confirmation---confirmation%1:10:00:: .
It was barely possible that his brother---brother%1:18:00:: was right .
He could tell they were approaching the sea---sea%1:17:00:: .
The air---air%1:27:00:: took on a special strength---strength%1:07:00:: now that they 'd left the fecund warmth---warmth%1:07:01:: of the farmland---farmland%1:15:00:: behind .
There was the smell---smell%1:07:00:: of the coast---coast%1:17:00:: , like a primeval memory---memory%1:09:02:: , composed of equal parts---part%1:24:00:: salt water---saltwater%1:27:00:: , clams---clam%1:05:00:: , seaweed---seaweed%1:05:00:: and northern air---air%1:27:00:: .
He turned from the flying trees---tree%1:20:00:: to look ahead and saw with an inward boy---boy%1:18:00:: 's eye---eye%1:08:00:: again the great fieldstone---fieldstone%1:27:00:: house---house%1:06:00:: which , built on one of the many acres---acre%1:23:00:: of ancestral land---land%1:21:00:: bordering the west harbor---harbor%1:15:00:: , had been Izaak---person%1:03:00:: 's bride-gift---bride-gift%1:21:00:: to his cousin---cousin%1:18:00:: wife---wife%1:18:00:: as the last century---century%1:28:00:: ended .
Mark---person%1:03:00:: 's thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: must have been keeping silent pace---pace%1:28:00:: beside his own , climbing the same crags---crag%1:17:00:: in dirty white---white%1:07:00:: sneakers---sneaker%1:06:00:: , clambering out on top---top%1:15:02:: of the headland---headland%1:17:00:: and coming upon the sudden glinting water---water%1:27:00:: at the same instant---instant%1:28:00:: .
Mark---person%1:03:00:: asked , and Abel---person%1:03:00:: lifted his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: from the double lines---line%1:10:01:: in the middle---middle%1:15:00:: of the road---road%1:06:00:: , the twin white---white%1:07:00:: ribbons---ribbon%1:17:00:: which the car---car%1:06:00:: swallowed rapidly as it ascended the crest---crest%1:15:01:: of the hill---hill%1:17:00:: and came down .
`` The Starbird , '' Abel---person%1:03:00:: said .
There was the day---day%1:28:01:: Uncle Izaak---person%1:03:00:: had , in an unexpected grandiose gesture---gesture%1:10:00:: , handed over the pretty sloop---sloop%1:06:00:: to Abel---person%1:03:00:: for keeps , on condition that he never fail to let his brother---brother%1:18:00:: accompany him whenever the younger boy---boy%1:18:00:: wished .
The two---two%1:23:00:: of them had developed into a remarkable sailing---sailing%1:04:00:: team---team%1:14:00:: .
All of this happening in a time---time%1:28:00:: of their lives---life%1:26:02:: when their youth---youth%1:26:00:: and their brotherhood---brotherhood%1:24:00:: knitted them together as no other time---time%1:28:05:: or circumstance---circumstance%1:26:01:: could .
They seemed then to have had a single mind---mind%1:09:00:: and body---body%1:08:00:: , a mutuality---mutuality%1:24:01:: which had been accepted with the fact---fact%1:26:01:: of their youth---youth%1:28:00:: , casually .
He saw the Starbird as she lay , her slender mast---mast%1:06:00:: up and gently turning , its point---point%1:25:00:: describing constant languid circles---circle%1:25:00:: against a cumulus---cumulus%1:17:00:: sky---sky%1:17:00:: .
Both of them had known the feeling---feeling%1:26:00:: of the small life---life%1:07:01:: in her waiting , ready , for the two of them to run up her sails---sail%1:06:00:: .
The Starbird had been long at the bottom---bottom%1:15:00:: of the bay---bay%1:17:00:: .
They came unexpectedly upon the sea---sea%1:17:00:: .
Meeting it without preparation---preparation%1:04:02:: as they did , robbed of anticipation---anticipation%1:12:00:: , a common disappointment---disappointment%1:12:00:: seized them .
They were climbing the hill---hill%1:17:00:: in the night---night%1:28:00:: when the headlights---headlight%1:06:00:: abruptly probed solid blackness---blackness%1:07:00:: , became two parallel luminous tubes---tube%1:25:00:: which broadened out into a faint mist---mist%1:19:00:: of light---light%1:19:00:: and ended .
Mark---person%1:03:00:: stopped the car---car%1:06:00:: and switched off the lights---light%1:06:00:: and they sat looking at---looking_at%1:04:00:: the water---water%1:27:00:: , which , there being no moon---moon%1:17:01:: out , at first could be distinguished from the sky---sky%1:17:00:: only by an absence---absence%1:04:00:: of stars---star%1:17:00:: .
Too often a beginning bodybuilder---bodybuilder%1:18:00:: has to do his training---training%1:04:00:: secretly either because his parents---parent%1:18:00:: do n't want sonny-boy---sonny_boy%1:18:00:: to `` lift all those old barbell---barbell%1:06:00:: things---thing%1:06:00:: '' because `` you 'll stunt your growth---growth%1:22:00:: '' or because childish taunts---taunt%1:04:00:: from his schoolmates---schoolmate%1:18:00:: , like `` Hey , lookit Mr. America---person%1:03:00:: , whaddya gonna do with all those muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: ( of which he has none at the time---time%1:28:00:: ) '' ?
After all , a guy---guy%1:18:00:: 's gotta have a little ego---ego%1:12:01:: !
Therefore it 's a genuine pleasure---pleasure%1:12:00:: to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder---bodybuilder%1:18:00:: who has never had to train in secret ; has never heard one unkind word---word%1:10:03:: from his parents---parent%1:18:00:: ; and never has been taunted by his schoolmates---schoolmate%1:18:00:: !
This happy , always smiling lad---lad%1:18:00:: with the sunny disposition---disposition%1:07:00:: is our new Junior Mr. Canada---person%1:03:00:: - Henri de Courcy---person%1:03:00:: .
Far from discouraging Henri---person%1:03:00:: , his parents---parent%1:18:00:: urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments---accomplishment%1:04:00:: .
Instead of admonishing him to let the weights---weight%1:06:01:: alone they personally took him to that master Montreal---montreal%1:15:00:: bodybuilding---bodybuilding%1:04:00:: authority---authority%1:18:00:: , Professor Roland Claude---person%1:03:00:: .
And they could n't have entrusted Henri---person%1:03:00:: to better hands---hands%1:04:00:: because `` le professeur '' knows his muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: from the sterno-cleido mastoideus---sternocleido_mastoideus%1:08:00:: of the neck---neck%1:08:00:: right down to the tibialis anticus---tibialis_anticus%1:08:00:: of the leg---leg%1:08:01:: - and better still , he knows just what exercises---exercise%1:04:00:: work best for them and what Weider---person%1:03:00:: principles---principle%1:09:04:: to combine them with for fast , fast muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: growth---growth%1:22:00:: .
That 's because the good professor---professor%1:18:00:: teaches only Weider---person%1:03:00:: methods---method%1:09:00:: at his famous Montreal Health Studio---group%1:03:00:: which is located at 1821 Mt. Royal East---location%1:03:00:: in Montreal---montreal%1:15:00:: .
Undoubtedly you have read the case histories---case_history%1:10:00:: of some of his prize winning pupils---pupil%1:18:00:: ( every pupil---pupil%1:18:00:: has a physique---physique%1:07:00:: title---title%1:26:00:: of some kind---kind%1:09:00:: or other ) .
There 's Gaetan d'Amours---person%1:03:00:: who is our newest Mr. Canada---person%1:03:00:: ; Jean-Paul Senesac---person%1:03:00:: , whose story---story%1:10:04:: appeared here two issues---issue%1:10:00:: ago ; Jack Boissoneault---person%1:03:00:: , who was with us last month---month%1:28:01:: ; Charles Harve---person%1:03:00:: , who recently won the `` Most Muscular Man---man%1:18:00:: '' subdivision---subdivision%1:14:01:: award---award%1:21:00:: in the Mr. Canada---person%1:03:00:: event---event%1:03:00:: ; and a host---host%1:14:00:: of others .
Yesiree , the professor---professor%1:18:00:: knows his muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: !
Now when Henri---person%1:03:00:: was just 12 he was only 4 ' 10 '' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds---pound%1:23:09:: , and his greatest desire---desire%1:12:00:: was to pack on some weight---weight%1:07:00:: .
About that time---time%1:11:00:: he began reading Mr. America---person%1:03:00:: and Muscle Builder---person%1:03:00:: and he learned of the famous Weider---person%1:03:00:: way---way%1:04:01:: to fast weight gaining---weight_gaining%1:04:00:: .
Seeing so many illustrations---illustration%1:10:00:: and reading so many testimonials---testimonial%1:10:02:: to the value---value%1:07:00:: of Quick-Wate and Super-Protein , those two wonder-working Weider---person%1:03:00:: food---food%1:03:00:: supplements---supplement%1:06:00:: , he decided to try them and see what they could do for him .
For in almost less time---time%1:28:05:: than it takes to tell it , Henri---person%1:03:00:: 's body---body%1:08:00:: weight---weight%1:07:00:: was increasing rapidly .
Of course he did some exercising---exercising%1:04:00:: - he 's crazy about water skiing---water-skiing%1:04:00:: and swimming---swimming%1:04:00:: and this vigorous exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: in conjunction with the added food---food%1:03:00:: supplements---supplement%1:06:00:: packed pounds---pound%1:23:09:: of solid muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: on his skinny frame---frame%1:08:01:: .
Henri---person%1:03:00:: has always had shapely legs---leg%1:08:01:: from swimming and water skiing and really does n't have to work them very much .
But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body---body%1:08:01:: .
`` A real ' nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: ' torso---torso%1:08:00:: '' , says Henri---person%1:03:00:: .
That 's when he went to Professor Claude---person%1:03:00:: .
And at once Claude---person%1:03:00:: saw what the trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: was and he knew just how to correct it .
In his gym---gym%1:06:00:: the professor---professor%1:18:00:: has some of the most `` knocked out '' equipment---equipment%1:06:00:: since Vic Tanny---person%1:03:00:: .
Mr. Claude is a specialist in torso development---development%1:04:01:: and he has long favored the now famous Weider Push-Pull Super-Set technique in which one exercise of the Super-Set is a pressing or `` pushing '' movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way , followed by a `` pulling '' exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group .
Mr. Claude---person%1:03:00:: is a specialist---specialist%1:18:00:: in torso---torso%1:08:00:: development---development%1:22:01:: and he has long favored the now famous Weider Push-Pull Super-Set technique---technique%1:09:00:: in which one exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: of the Super-Set is a pressing---pressing%1:04:00:: or `` pushing---pushing%1:04:00:: '' movement---movement%1:04:00:: which accents one sector---sector%1:25:00:: of a muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: in a specific way---way%1:07:01:: , followed by a `` pulling---pulling%1:04:00:: '' exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: which works the opposing sector---sector%1:25:00:: of the same muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: .
So right away Claude---person%1:03:00:: introduced Henri---person%1:03:00:: to his famous `` moon---moon%1:17:02:: '' bench---bench%1:06:01:: and proceeded to teach him his first Push-Pull Super-Set consisting of the wide grip---grip%1:04:00:: Straight-Arm Pullover ( the `` pull---pull%1:04:00:: '' part---part%1:24:00:: of the Push-Pull Super-Set ) which dramatically widens the rib cage---rib_cage%1:08:00:: and strongly affects the muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: of the upper back---back%1:08:00:: and chest---chest%1:08:00:: , and the collar-to-collar Bench Press---bench_press%1:04:00:: which specifically works on the chest---chest%1:08:00:: to build those wide , Reeves-type---person%1:03:00:: `` gladiator---gladiator%1:18:00:: '' pecs---pecs%1:08:00:: , while stimulating the upper lats---lat%1:08:00:: and frontal deltoids---deltoid%1:08:00:: .
As you can see , in this Push-Pull Super Set the entire chest---chest%1:08:00:: back---back%1:08:00:: shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: area---area%1:08:00:: is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors---sector%1:25:00:: by alternate exercises---exercise%1:04:00:: , so the complete torso---torso%1:08:00:: remains pumped-up all the time !
Now when Henri---person%1:03:00:: has completed four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No.---no.%1:23:00:: 1---1%1:23:00:: , the professor---professor%1:18:00:: allows him about a five minute---minute%1:28:00:: rest---rest%1:04:00:: period---period%1:28:00:: before starting him on four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No.---no.%1:23:00:: 2 .
Super-Set No.---no.%1:23:00:: 2---2%1:23:00:: is made up of similar exercises---exercise%1:04:00:: , but this time---time%1:11:00:: done with dumbbells---dumbbell%1:06:00:: , and using both `` moon '' and flat benches---flat_bench%1:06:00:: .
The `` push---push%1:04:00:: '' exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: of this Push-Pull Super-Set is the Bench Press---bench_press%1:04:00:: done with elbows---elbow%1:08:00:: well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch---stretch%1:04:00:: of the pectorals---pectoral%1:08:00:: not possible with the barbell---barbell%1:06:00:: variation---variation%1:04:00:: .
You need the barbell---barbell%1:06:00:: variation---variation%1:04:00:: to build width---width%1:07:00:: and mass---mass%1:07:01:: in the pecs---pecs%1:08:00:: .
The dumbbell---dumbbell%1:06:00:: variation---variation%1:04:00:: develops a most classically sculptured outline---outline%1:15:00:: to the pecs---pecs%1:08:00:: .
The `` pull---pull%1:04:00:: '' exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: in this Super-Set is the one dumbbell---dumbbell%1:06:00:: Bent-Arm Pullover .
( Note how strongly the upper lats---lat%1:08:00:: and serratus---serratus%1:08:00:: are worked in this fine exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: because of the pin point concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: of force---force%1:19:00:: which the dumbbell---dumbbell%1:06:00:: variation---variation%1:04:00:: affords ) .
In the third Push-Pull Super-Set the `` push---push%1:04:00:: '' exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: is the wide grip---grip%1:04:00:: Pushup Between Bars , while the `` pull---pull%1:04:00:: '' exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms---arm%1:08:00:: .
The Pushup---pushup%1:04:00:: done in this manner---manner%1:07:02:: is the greatest pectoral---pectoral%1:08:00:: rib cage---rib_cage%1:08:00:: stretcher---stretch%1:04:00:: ever invented !
This is true only if a very wide grip---grip%1:04:00:: is used and only when the greatest possible stretch---stretch%1:04:01:: is achieved .
You 'll know when you 've made the greatest stretch---stretch%1:04:01:: because your shoulder blades---shoulder_blade%1:08:00:: will touch !
As you see , the professor---professor%1:18:00:: has designed a piece---piece%1:06:05:: of apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: that forces the bodybuilder---bodybuilder%1:18:00:: to use a wide grip---grip%1:04:00:: .
But as you can also see , it 's not a painful exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: at all , because Henri de Courcy---person%1:03:00:: - the `` happy '' bodybuilder---bodybuilder%1:18:00:: - looks as though he were having the time---time%1:11:01:: of his life---life%1:28:00:: !
The last exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: of Roland Claude---person%1:03:00:: 's prescribed program---program%1:09:00:: for Henri---person%1:03:00:: is a single exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: , done in individual sets---set%1:04:00:: with a bit longer pause---pause%1:28:00:: between sets---set%1:04:00:: .
By this time---time%1:11:00:: Henri---person%1:03:00:: 's entire chest---chest%1:08:00:: back---back%1:08:00:: - lat---lat%1:08:00:: shoulder---shoulder%1:08:00:: area---area%1:08:00:: is pumped-up to almost bursting point---point%1:26:00:: , and Claude---person%1:03:00:: takes time---time%1:28:05:: to do a bit more pectoral---pectoral%1:08:00:: front---front%1:06:00:: deltoid---deltoid%1:08:00:: shaping---shaping%1:22:00:: work---work%1:04:00:: .
He has Henri---person%1:03:00:: do from four to six sets---set%1:04:00:: of the Incline Bench Press---incline_bench_press%1:04:00:: ( note the high incline---incline%1:06:00:: ) .
This gives a wide flare---flare%1:25:00:: to the pecs---pecs%1:08:00:: , causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids---deltoid%1:08:00:: and dramatically downward into the serratus---serratus%1:08:00:: and lats---lat%1:08:00:: .
This is the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of chest---chest%1:08:00:: that invariably wins contests---contest%1:11:00:: that steel---steel%1:27:00:: edged `` carved out of solid rock---rock%1:17:01:: '' looks---look%1:07:00:: of the great champions---champion%1:18:01:: .
So with four complete Push-Pull Super-Sets No.---no.%1:23:00:: 1---1%1:23:00:: , four of No.---no.%1:23:00:: 2---2%1:23:00:: , four of No.---no.%1:23:00:: 3---3%1:23:00:: and four to six sets---set%1:04:00:: of the Incline Bench Press---incline_bench_press%1:04:00:: , you can see that Henri de Courcy---person%1:03:00:: has had a terrific mass---mass%1:07:01:: building , muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: shaping , torso---torso%1:08:00:: defining---defining%1:22:00:: workout---workout%1:04:00:: that cannot be improved upon .
Physique---physique%1:07:00:: contests---contest%1:11:00:: are rarely won on muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: size---size%1:07:00:: alone .
Rarer still is a Mr. America or Mr. Universe of true Herculean build---build%1:07:00:: .
The aspects---aspect%1:07:02:: of physical development---development%1:26:00:: that catch the judges---judge%1:18:01:: ' eyes---eye%1:09:01:: and which rightfully influence their decisions---decision%1:11:01:: are symmetry---symmetry%1:25:00:: and that hallmark---hallmark%1:07:00:: of the true champion---champion%1:18:01:: - superior definition---definition%1:07:00:: of the muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: .
Now good definition---definition%1:07:00:: is one thing---thing%1:07:00:: that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set , high-rep , light weight---weight%1:06:01:: workouts---workout%1:04:00:: .
But contest---contest%1:11:00:: definition---definition%1:07:00:: - that dramatic muscular separation---separation%1:07:00:: of every muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor---sculptor%1:18:00:: 's chisel---chisel%1:06:00:: - is something quite different .
This comes not alone from high-set , high-rep training---training%1:04:00:: , but from certain definition---definition%1:07:00:: specialization---specialization%1:04:01:: exercises---exercise%1:04:00:: which the champion---champion%1:18:01:: selects for himself with the knowledge---knowledge%1:03:00:: of exactly what works best for him .
Often these exercises---exercise%1:04:00:: work well for some bodybuilders---bodybuilder%1:18:00:: but less spectacularly for others .
Because they are `` minority---minority%1:07:00:: '' exercises---exercise%1:04:00:: and have but a limited appeal---appeal%1:07:00:: they soon find themselves in the limbo---limbo%1:26:01:: of the forgotten .
The exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: I shall discuss in this - the first of a new series---series%1:14:00:: of articles---article%1:10:00:: on muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: definition---definition%1:07:00:: specialization---specialization%1:04:01:: of a particular body part---body_part%1:08:00:: - is the One Leg Lunge .
Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment---moment%1:28:01:: I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone , no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone---thighbone%1:08:00:: lengths---length%1:07:00:: !
It is the one exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: that drastically influences the definition---definition%1:07:00:: of the thighs---thigh%1:08:00:: at the hipline---hipline%1:15:01:: - that mark---mark%1:10:02:: of the champion---champion%1:18:01:: that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders---bodybuilder%1:18:00:: - a criterion---criterion%1:09:00:: of muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: `` drama---drama%1:07:00:: '' that is unforgettable to judges---judge%1:18:01:: and audiences---audience%1:14:00:: alike - the facet---facet%1:09:00:: of muscular development---development%1:22:01:: that wins prizes---prize%1:21:00:: .
Definition---definition%1:07:00:: of the thighs---thigh%1:08:00:: at the uppermost part---part%1:24:00:: is quite commonly seen in most championship---championship%1:26:00:: Olympic lifters---lifter%1:18:00:: which is easily understandable .
The One Leg Lunge is a split---split%1:04:02:: and all lifters---lifter%1:18:00:: practice this in their regular workouts---workout%1:04:00:: .
But for purely definition---definition%1:07:00:: purposes---purpose%1:07:00:: - used in conjunction---conjunction%1:07:00:: with your regular Squatting---squatting%1:04:01:: , Leg Curling---leg_curling%1:04:00:: , Leg Extensor---leg_extensor%1:04:00:: programs---program%1:09:00:: - a heavy weight---weight%1:06:01:: is not needed .
Indeed , a lighter weight---weight%1:06:01:: works much better because a greater , more extensive split---split%1:04:02:: can be performed .
Used in several sets---set%1:04:00:: of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg---leg%1:08:01:: takes on a razor-sharp definition---definition%1:07:00:: in which the muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: look like wire---wire%1:06:01:: cables---cable%1:06:02:: writhing and twisting under the skin---skin%1:08:00:: !
Really there is no reason---reason%1:16:00:: why this fine exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: should not find its way into your leg---leg%1:08:01:: program---program%1:09:00:: at all times---time%1:11:00:: , for the following suggestions---suggestion%1:10:00:: show why it is so effective :
It 's a complete thigh---thigh%1:08:00:: contraction---contraction%1:04:01:: extension---extension%1:04:01:: exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: .
It places terrific tension---tension%1:26:01:: on the leg---leg%1:08:01:: muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: from start to finish of each repetition---repetition%1:04:00:: .
It improves over-all balance---balance%1:26:00:: and control---control%1:04:02:: for the bodybuilder---bodybuilder%1:18:00:: , and helps to make Squats---squat%1:04:01:: more easily and more correctly performed .
It increases flexibility---flexibility%1:07:02:: of the legs---leg%1:08:01:: .
It speeds muscle---muscle%1:08:00:: growth---growth%1:22:00:: and power---power%1:07:02:: development---development%1:22:01:: even for the advanced bodybuilder---bodybuilder%1:18:00:: because each hip---hip%1:08:00:: and leg---leg%1:08:01:: is exercised separately , thus enabling a massive , concentrated effort---effort%1:04:01:: to be focused on each .
You 'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: and here 's the way---way%1:07:01:: it 's done :
Place your Power Stands in position---position%1:15:00:: and adjust their height---height%1:07:00:: so that this will correspond to the height---height%1:07:00:: of your shoulders---shoulder%1:08:00:: when you are in a deep leg---leg%1:08:01:: split---split%1:04:02:: as for a heavy Clean---clean%1:04:00:: .
Place a suitably loaded barbell---barbell%1:06:00:: across them ; grasp the bar---bar%1:06:00:: ( which will rest---rest%1:06:00:: against the back of your neck---neck%1:08:00:: ) ; extend your feet---foot%1:08:01:: forward and backward until you are in a deep leg---leg%1:08:01:: split---split%1:04:02:: .
Now raise the weight---weight%1:06:01:: by straightening your front leg---leg%1:08:01:: , without moving your feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
When the front knee---knee%1:08:00:: is straight and locked , allow it to bend again until you feel the bar---bar%1:06:00:: come lightly into contact---contact%1:04:00:: with the sides---side%1:15:00:: of the Power Stands .
After you have taken a breather , reverse the position---position%1:07:01:: of your legs---leg%1:08:01:: so that the front thigh---thigh%1:08:00:: of the previous exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: is now to the rear---rear%1:15:00:: , and the rear thigh---thigh%1:08:00:: now to the front , and perform the same movement---movement%1:04:00:: in the same manner---manner%1:07:02:: .
You should have a couple of training---training%1:04:00:: partners---partner%1:18:00:: to stand by when you make your first experiments---experiment%1:04:01:: , just for safety---safety%1:26:00:: .
You should also begin this exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: with a very light barbell---barbell%1:06:00:: until you become accustomed to it balance wise .
Before your first training---training%1:04:00:: experiment---experiment%1:04:01:: has ended there will be a big improvement---improvement%1:26:00:: and almost before you know it you 'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran---veteran%1:18:00:: !
Although I suggested that you hold the bar---bar%1:06:00:: at the back of the neck---neck%1:08:00:: there 's no reason---reason%1:16:00:: why you should n't make some experiments---experiment%1:04:01:: with the bar---bar%1:06:00:: held in front of the neck---neck%1:08:00:: .
Squat style lifters---lifter%1:18:00:: and leg---leg%1:08:01:: split---split%1:04:02:: lifters---lifter%1:18:00:: would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations---variation%1:04:00:: providing that they remember to make alternate sets---set%1:04:00:: with the left and right leg---leg%1:08:01:: to the front .
I 'd have been more impressed if I had n't remembered that she 'd played Hedda Gabler---person%1:03:00:: in her highschool---highschool%1:14:00:: dramatics---dramatics%1:04:00:: course---course%1:04:01:: .
I did n't want her back on that broken record---record%1:06:00:: .
`` Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: 's free in the whole goddam world---world%1:17:01:: '' , was all I could think of to say .
When I 'd delivered myself of that gem---gem%1:06:01:: there was nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: to do but order up another drink---drink%1:13:04:: .
I 'd forgotten all about Thelma---person%1:03:00:: and the Kentucky Derby and how it was Thelma---person%1:03:00:: 's fifty dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: I was spending .
It was just me and Eileen---person%1:03:00:: getting drunk---drunk%1:18:00:: together like we used to in the old days---day%1:28:03:: , and me staring at her across the table---table%1:06:01:: crazy to get my hands---hand%1:08:00:: on her partly because I wanted to wring her neck---neck%1:08:00:: because she was so ornery but mostly because she was so wonderful to touch .
Drunk or sober she was the most attractive woman---woman%1:18:00:: in the world---world%1:17:01:: for me .
It was the call---call%1:10:05:: of the wild all right .
That evening---evening%1:28:00:: turned out to be hell like all the others .
We moved down Broadway---broadway%1:15:00:: from ginmill---ginmill%1:06:00:: to ginmill---ginmill%1:06:00:: .
It was the same old routine---routine%1:04:00:: .
Eileen---person%1:03:00:: got to dancing---dancing%1:04:00:: , just a little tiny dancing---dancing%1:04:00:: step---step%1:23:00:: to a hummed tune---tune%1:10:00:: that you could hardly notice , and trying to pick up strange men---man%1:18:00:: , but each time---time%1:11:00:: I was ready to say to hell with it and walk out she 'd pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice---voice%1:07:00:: about the good times---times%1:28:01:: and the happiness---happiness%1:12:00:: we 'd had together and there I was back on the hook .
I did have the decency---decency%1:07:00:: to call up Thelma---person%1:03:00:: and tell her I 'd met old friends---friend%1:18:00:: and would be home late .
`` I could scratch her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: out '' , Eileen---person%1:03:00:: cried and stamped her foot---foot%1:08:01:: when I came back from the phone booth---phone_booth%1:06:00:: .
`` You know I do n't like my men---man%1:18:00:: to have other women---woman%1:18:00:: .
It was a walk up---walk-up%1:06:01:: on Hudson Street---location%1:03:00:: .
There was a man---man%1:18:00:: 's jacket---jacket%1:06:00:: on the chair---chair%1:06:00:: and a straw hat---straw_hat%1:06:00:: on the table---table%1:06:01:: .
The place---place%1:15:00:: smelt of some kind---kind%1:09:00:: of hair---hair%1:08:00:: lotion---lotion%1:06:00:: these pimp---pimp%1:18:00:: like characters---character%1:18:00:: use .
`` What about Ballestre---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
`` Precious---person%1:03:00:: .
`` Precious---person%1:03:00:: and I allow each other absolute freedom---freedom%1:26:00:: .
He 's used to me bringing home strange men---man%1:18:00:: .
I 'll just tell him you 're my husband---husband%1:18:00:: .
If he pokes his nose---nose%1:08:00:: in here I 'll slug him '' .
She was still laughing when I grabbed her and started rolling her on the bed---bed%1:06:00:: .
After all I'm made of flesh---flesh%1:08:02:: and blood---blood%1:08:00:: .
I'm not a plaster saint---plaster_saint%1:18:00:: .
Never in my life---life%1:28:01:: have I felt so remorseful about anything I 've done as I did about spending that night---night%1:28:00:: with my own wife---wife%1:18:00:: .
We both had hangovers---hangover%1:26:00:: .
Eileen---person%1:03:00:: declared she could n't lift her head---head%1:08:00:: from the pillow---pillow%1:06:00:: .
She lay under the covers---cover%1:06:01:: making jabbing---jabbing%1:04:00:: motions---motion%1:04:00:: with her forefinger---forefinger%1:08:00:: telling me where to look for the coffeepot---coffeepot%1:06:00:: .
I was stumbling in my undershirt---undershirt%1:06:00:: trying to find my way---way%1:15:00:: around her damn kitchenette---kitchenette%1:06:00:: when I smelt that sickish sweet hairtonic smell---smell%1:09:02:: .
There was somebody else in the apartment---apartment%1:06:00:: .
Honest I could feel the hair---hair%1:08:00:: stand up on the back---back%1:06:00:: of my neck---neck%1:08:00:: like a dog---dog%1:05:00:: 's that is going to get into a fight---fight%1:04:02:: .
I turned around with the percolator---percolator%1:06:00:: in my hand---hand%1:06:00:: .
My eyes---eye%1:08:00:: were so bleary I could barely see him but there he was , a little smooth olivefaced guy---guy%1:18:00:: in a new spring---spring%1:28:00:: overcoat---overcoat%1:06:00:: and a taffy---taffy%1:13:00:: colored fedora---fedora%1:06:00:: .
Brown eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , eyebrow---eyebrow%1:08:00:: mustache---mustache%1:08:00:: .
Oval face---face%1:08:00:: without an expression---expression%1:07:00:: in the world .
We did n't have time---time%1:28:05:: to speak before Eileen---person%1:03:00:: 's voice---voice%1:07:00:: was screeching at us from the bed---bed%1:06:00:: .
`` Joseph Maria Ballestre---person%1:03:00:: meet Francis Xavier Bowman---person%1:03:00:: .
Exboyfriend meet exhusband---ex-husband%1:18:00:: '' .
She gave the nastiest laugh---laugh%1:10:00:: I ever heard .
`` And do n't either of you forget that I'm not any man---man%1:18:00:: 's property---property%1:21:00:: .
If you want to fight , go down on the sidewalk---sidewalk%1:06:00:: '' .
She was enjoying the situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
Eileen---person%1:03:00:: was a psychologist---psychologist%1:18:00:: all right .
Instead of wanting to sock the poor bastard---bastard%1:18:00:: I found myself having a fellow-feeling---fellow_feeling%1:12:00:: for him .
Maybe he felt the same way---way%1:26:00:: .
I never felt such a lowdown hound---hound%1:18:00:: in my life---life%1:28:01:: .
First thing---thing%1:09:02:: I knew he was in the kitchenette---kitchenette%1:06:00:: cooking up the breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: and I was handing Eileen---person%1:03:00:: her coffee-cup---coffee_cup%1:06:00:: and she was lying there handsome as a queen---queen%1:18:00:: among her courtiers---courtier%1:18:00:: .
I could n't face Thelma---person%1:03:00:: after that night---night%1:28:00:: .
I did n't even have the nerve---nerve%1:07:00:: to call her on the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: .
I wrote her that I 'd met up with Eileen---person%1:03:00:: and that old bonds---bond%1:06:01:: had proved too strong and asked her to send my clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: down by express .
Of course I had to give her Eileen---person%1:03:00:: 's address---address%1:15:00:: , but she never came near us .
All she did was write me a pleasant little note---note%1:10:03:: about how it was beautiful while it lasted but that now life---life%1:09:00:: had parted our ways---way%1:04:00:: and it was goodbye---good-bye%1:10:00:: forever .
She never said a word---word%1:10:03:: about the fifty dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: .
She added a postscript---postscript%1:10:00:: begging me to be careful about drinking---drinking%1:04:00:: .
I must know that that was my greatest weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: underlined three times---time%1:11:00:: .
Afterwards I learned that Eileen---person%1:03:00:: had called Thelma---person%1:03:00:: on the telephone---telephone%1:06:00:: and made a big scene---scene%1:26:01:: about Thelma---person%1:03:00:: trying to take her husband---husband%1:18:00:: away .
That finished me with Thelma---person%1:03:00:: .
Trust Eileen---person%1:03:00:: to squeeze all the drama---drama%1:10:01:: out of a situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
And there I was shacked up with Eileen---person%1:03:00:: in that filthy fourth floor---floor%1:06:01:: attic---attic%1:06:00:: on Hudson Street---location%1:03:00:: .
I use the phrase---phrase%1:10:00:: advisedly because there was something positively indecent about our relationship---relationship%1:26:00:: .
What I did know was that Precious---person%1:03:00:: was always around .
He slept in the hall---hall%1:06:03:: bedroom---bedroom%1:06:00:: at the head---head%1:15:00:: of the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: .
`` Who do you think pays the rent---rent%1:21:00:: ?
You would n't have me throw the poor boy---boy%1:18:02:: out on the street---street%1:06:00:: '' , Eileen---person%1:03:00:: said when I needled her about it .
I said sure that was what I wanted her to do but she paid no attention---attention%1:04:02:: .
Eileen---person%1:03:00:: had a wonderful way---way%1:04:00:: of not listening to things---thing%1:10:00:: she did n't want to hear .
Still I did n't think she was twotiming me with Precious---person%1:03:00:: right then .
To be on the safe side---side%1:14:00:: I never let Eileen---person%1:03:00:: get out of my sight---sight%1:10:00:: day---day%1:28:02:: or night---night%1:28:00:: .
Precious---person%1:03:00:: had me worried .
I could n't make out what his racket---racket%1:11:00:: was .
I 'd thought him a pimp---pimp%1:18:00:: or procurer---procurer%1:18:00:: but he did n't seem to be .
He was smooth and civil spoken but it seemed to me there was something tough under his self-effacing manner---manner%1:07:01:: .
Still he let Eileen---person%1:03:00:: treat him like a valet---valet%1:18:00:: .
Whenever the place---place%1:15:06:: was cleaned or a meal---meal%1:13:00:: served it was Precious---person%1:03:00:: who did the work---work%1:04:00:: .
I never could find out what his business---business%1:04:00:: was .
He always seemed to have money---money%1:21:00:: in his pocket---pocket%1:06:00:: .
The phone---phone%1:06:00:: had been disconnected but telegrams---telegram%1:10:00:: came for him and notes---note%1:10:03:: by special messenger---messenger%1:18:00:: .
Now and then he would disappear for several days---day%1:28:00:: .
`` Connections---connection%1:18:01:: '' was all he would say with that smooth hurt smile---smile%1:10:00:: when I put leading questions---question%1:10:00:: .
`` Oh he 's just an international spy---spy%1:18:00:: '' , Eileen---person%1:03:00:: would shout with her screechy laugh---laugh%1:10:00:: .
Poor devil---poor_devil%1:18:00:: he can n't have been too happy either .
He got no relief---relief%1:26:00:: from drink---drink%1:04:00:: because , though sometimes Precious---person%1:03:00:: would buy himself a drink---drink%1:13:00:: if he went out with us in the evening---evening%1:28:00:: , he 'd leave it on the table---table%1:06:01:: untouched .
When I was in liquor---liquor%1:13:00:: I rode him pretty hard I guess .
Occasionally if I pushed him too far he 'd give me a look---look%1:04:00:: out of narrowed eyes---eye%1:08:00:: and the hard cruel bony skull---skull%1:08:00:: would show through that smooth face---face%1:08:00:: of his .
`` Some day '' , I told Eileen---person%1:03:00:: , `` that guy---guy%1:18:00:: will kill us both '' .
Getting drunk every night was the only way---way%1:04:01:: I could handle the situation---situation%1:26:00:: .
Eileen---person%1:03:00:: seemed to feel the same way---way%1:26:00:: .
We still had that much---much%1:23:00:: in common .
The trouble---trouble%1:09:00:: was drinking---drinking%1:04:00:: cost money---money%1:21:00:: .
The way---way%1:07:01:: Eileen---person%1:03:00:: and I were hitting it up , we needed ten or fifteen dollars---dollar%1:23:00:: an evening---evening%1:28:00:: .
Eileen---person%1:03:00:: must have wheedled a little out of Precious---person%1:03:00:: .
I raised some kale---kale%1:21:00:: by hocking the good clothes---clothes%1:06:00:: I had left over from my respectable uptown---uptown%1:15:00:: life---life%1:09:00:: , but when that was gone I did n't have a cent---cent%1:21:00:: .
I do n't know what we would have done if Pat O'Dwyer---person%1:03:00:: had n't come to town---town%1:15:00:: .
Pat O'Dwyer---person%1:03:00:: looked like a heavier Jim---person%1:03:00:: .
He had the same bullet head---bullethead%1:08:00:: of curly reddish hair---hair%1:08:00:: but he did n't have Jim---person%1:03:00:: 's poker-faced humor---humor%1:07:01:: or his brains---brain%1:09:00:: or his charm---charm%1:07:00:: .
He was a big thick beefy violent man---man%1:18:00:: .
Now Pat---person%1:03:00:: may have been a lecher---lecher%1:18:00:: and a plug-ugly---plug-ugly%1:18:00:: , but he was a good churchgoing Catholic---catholic%1:18:00:: and he loved his little sister---little_sister%1:18:00:: .
Those O'Dwyers---person%1:03:00:: had that Irish clannishness---clannishness%1:07:00:: that made them stick together in spite of politics---politics%1:09:01:: and everything .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: took Eileen---person%1:03:00:: and me out to dinner---dinner%1:13:00:: at a swell steak house---steakhouse%1:06:00:: and told us with tears---tears%1:04:00:: in his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: how happy he was we had come together again .
`` Whom God---god%1:18:00:: hath joined '' etcetera .
The O'Dwyers---person%1:03:00:: were real religious people---people%1:14:00:: except for Kate---person%1:03:00:: .
Now it would be up to me to keep the little girl---girl%1:18:02:: out of mischief---mischief%1:04:00:: .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: had been worried as hell ever since she 'd lost her job---job%1:04:00:: on that fashion---fashion%1:09:00:: magazine---magazine%1:10:00:: .
It had gone big with the Hollywood---location%1:03:00:: girls---girl%1:18:00:: when he told them his sister---sister%1:18:00:: was an editor---editor%1:18:00:: of Art and Apparel .
How about me trying to help her get her job---job%1:04:00:: back ?
All evening---evening%1:28:00:: Eileen---person%1:03:00:: had been as demure as a little girl---girl%1:18:02:: getting ready for her first communion---communion%1:04:01:: .
It just about blew us both out of the water when Eileen---person%1:03:00:: suddenly came out with what she came out with .
`` But brother---brother%1:18:00:: I can n't take a job---job%1:04:00:: right now '' , she said with her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: on her ice cream---ice_cream%1:13:00:: , `` I'm going to have a baby---baby%1:18:00:: , Francis Xavier---person%1:03:00:: 's baby---baby%1:18:00:: , my own husband---husband%1:18:00:: 's baby---baby%1:18:00:: '' .
My first thought---thought%1:09:01:: was how had it happened so soon , but I counted back on my fingers---finger%1:08:00:: and sure enough we 'd been living together six weeks---week%1:28:00:: .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: meanwhile was bubbling over with sentiment---sentiment%1:12:00:: .
Greatest thing---thing%1:11:00:: that ever happened .
Now Eileen---person%1:03:00:: really would have to settle down to love honor and obey , and she 'd have to quit drinking---drinking%1:04:00:: .
He 'd come East---east%1:24:00:: for the christening---christening%1:04:00:: , by God he would .
When we separated that evening---evening%1:28:00:: Pat---person%1:03:00:: pushed a hundred dollar bill---dollar_bill%1:21:00:: into Eileen---person%1:03:00:: 's hand---hand%1:08:00:: to help towards a layette---layette%1:06:00:: .
Before he left town---town%1:15:00:: Pat---person%1:03:00:: saw to it that I was fixed up with a job---job%1:04:00:: .
Pat---person%1:03:00:: had contacts---contact%1:10:00:: all over the labor movement---labor_movement%1:14:00:: .
A friend---friend%1:18:00:: of Pat---person%1:03:00:: 's named Frank Sposato---person%1:03:00:: had just muscled into the Portwatchers ' Union---group%1:03:00:: .
The portwatchers---portwatcher%1:18:00:: were retired longshoremen---longshoreman%1:18:00:: and small time seafarers---seafarer%1:18:00:: off towboats---towboat%1:06:00:: and barges---barge%1:06:00:: who acted as watchmen---watchman%1:18:00:: on the wharves---wharf%1:06:00:: .
Most of them were elderly men---man%1:18:00:: .
It was responsible and sometimes dangerous work---work%1:04:01:: because the thieving---thieving%1:04:00:: is awful in the port---port%1:15:00:: of New York---location%1:03:00:: .
One reason---reason%1:16:00:: the portwatchers---portwatcher%1:18:00:: let Sposato---person%1:03:00:: take them over was to get the protection---protection%1:04:00:: of his musclemen---muscleman%1:18:00:: .
Sposato---person%1:03:00:: needed a front---front%1:18:00:: , some labor---labor%1:14:00:: stiff---stiff%1:18:00:: with a clean record---record%1:04:01:: to act as business agent---business_agent%1:18:00:: of the Redhook---group%1:03:00:: local---local%1:06:00:: .
There I was a retired wobbly---group%1:03:00:: and structural iron worker---ironworker%1:18:00:: who 'd never gouged a cent---cent%1:21:00:: off a fellow worker---fellow_worker%1:18:00:: in my thirty years---years%1:28:00:: in the movement---movement%1:14:00:: .
For once radicalism---radicalism%1:09:00:: was a recommendation---recommendation%1:10:02:: .
Sposato---person%1:03:00:: could n't wait to get me hired .
With my gray hair---hair%1:08:00:: and my weatherbeaten countenance---countenance%1:07:00:: I certainly looked the honest working stiff---stiff%1:18:00:: .
The things---thing%1:04:00:: a man---man%1:18:00:: will do for a woman---woman%1:18:00:: .
Rookie---rookie%1:18:00:: Ron Nischwitz---person%1:03:00:: continued his pinpoint pitching---pitching%1:04:00:: Monday---monday%1:28:00:: night---night%1:28:00:: as the Bears---group%1:03:00:: made it two---two%1:23:00:: straight over Indianapolis---indianapolis%1:15:00:: , 5 - 3 .
The husky 6 - 3 , 205 - pound---pound%1:23:09:: lefthander---left-hander%1:18:01:: , was in command---command%1:07:00:: all the way before an on the scene audience---audience%1:14:00:: of only 949 and countless of television---television%1:10:00:: viewers---viewers%1:14:00:: in the Denver---denver%1:15:00:: area---area%1:15:01:: .
It was Nischwitz---person%1:03:00:: ' third straight victory---victory%1:11:00:: of the new season---season%1:28:02:: and ran the Grizzlies---group%1:03:00:: ' winning---winning%1:04:00:: streak---streak%1:14:00:: to four---four%1:23:00:: straight .
They now lead Louisville---group%1:03:00:: by a full game---game%1:04:00:: on top---top%1:26:00:: of the American Association---group%1:03:00:: pack---pack%1:14:03:: .
Nischwitz---person%1:03:00:: fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton---person%1:03:00:: in the third inning---inning%1:28:00:: .
He has given only the one pass---pass%1:04:04:: in his 27 innings---inning%1:28:00:: , an unusual characteristic---characteristic%1:09:00:: for a southpaw---southpaw%1:18:01:: .
The Bears---group%1:03:00:: took the lead---lead%1:07:02:: in the first inning---inning%1:28:00:: , as they did in Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: 's opener---opener%1:11:00:: , and never lagged .
Dick McAuliffe---person%1:03:00:: cracked the first of his two doubles---double%1:04:00:: against Lefty---lefty%1:18:00:: Don Rudolph---person%1:03:00:: to open the Bear---group%1:03:00:: 's attack---attack%1:04:04:: .
After Al Paschal---person%1:03:00:: grounded out , Jay Cooke---person%1:03:00:: walked and Jim McDaniel---person%1:03:00:: singled home---home%1:06:02:: McAuliffe---person%1:03:00:: .
Alusik---person%1:03:00:: then moved Cooke---person%1:03:00:: across with a line drive---line_drive%1:04:00:: to left---left%1:06:00:: .
Jay Porter---person%1:03:00:: drew a base on balls---base_on_balls%1:04:00:: to fill the bases---base%1:06:02:: but Don Wert---person%1:03:00:: 's smash---smash%1:11:01:: was knocked down by Rudolph---person%1:03:00:: for the putout---putout%1:04:00:: .
The Bears---group%1:03:00:: added two more in the fifth when McAuliffe---person%1:03:00:: dropped a double---double%1:04:00:: into the leftfield---leftfield%1:06:00:: corner---corner%1:15:02:: , Paschal---person%1:03:00:: doubled down the rightfield---rightfield%1:06:00:: line---line%1:15:01:: and Cooke---person%1:03:00:: singled off Phil Shartzer---person%1:03:00:: 's glove---glove%1:06:01:: .
Nischwitz---person%1:03:00:: was working on a 3 hitter---3-hitter%1:04:00:: when the Indians---group%1:03:00:: bunched three of their eight hits---hit%1:04:03:: for two runs---run%1:04:01:: in the sixth .
Chuck Hinton---person%1:03:00:: tripled to the rightfield---rightfield%1:06:00:: corner---corner%1:15:02:: , Cliff Cook---person%1:03:00:: and Dan Pavletich---person%1:03:00:: singled and Gaines---person%1:03:00:: ' infielder---infielder%1:18:00:: roller---roller%1:04:00:: accounted for the tallies---tally%1:04:01:: .
The Bears---group%1:03:00:: added their last run---run%1:04:01:: in the sixth on Alusik---person%1:03:00:: 's double---double%1:04:00:: and outfield---outfield%1:06:00:: flies---fly%1:04:00:: by Porter---person%1:03:00:: and Wert---person%1:03:00:: .
Gaines---person%1:03:00:: hammered the ball---ball%1:06:01:: over the left fence---fence%1:06:00:: for the third Indianapolis---group%1:03:00:: run---run%1:04:01:: in the ninth .
Despite the 45 - degree---degree%1:23:03:: weather---weather%1:19:00:: the game---game%1:04:00:: was clicked off in 1 : 48 , thanks---thanks%1:10:00:: to only three bases on balls---base_on_balls%1:04:00:: and some good infield---infield%1:06:00:: play---play%1:04:04:: .

Cliff Cook---person%1:03:00:: accounted for three---three%1:23:00:: of the Tribe---group%1:03:00:: 's eight hits---hit%1:04:03:: .

Jensen---person%1:03:00:: got only six hits---hit%1:04:03:: in 46 at-bats---at-bat%1:04:00:: for a .130 batting---batting%1:04:00:: average---average%1:09:00:: in the first 12 games---game%1:04:00:: .
He took a midnight---midnight%1:28:00:: train---train%1:06:00:: out of Cleveland---cleveland%1:15:00:: Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: , without an official word---word%1:10:03:: to anybody , and has stayed away from newsmen---newsman%1:18:00:: on his train---train%1:06:00:: trip---trip%1:04:00:: across the nation to Reno---location%1:03:00:: , Nev.---location%1:03:00:: , where his wife---wife%1:18:00:: , former Olympic Diving---diving%1:11:00:: Champion---champion%1:18:01:: Zoe Ann Olsen---person%1:03:00:: , awaited .
She said , when she learned Jackie---person%1:03:00:: was heading home :
`` I'm just speculating , but I have to think Jack---person%1:03:00:: feels he 's hurting Boston---group%1:03:00:: 's chances---chance%1:26:00:: '' .
The Union Pacific Railroad---group%1:03:00:: streamliner---streamliner%1:06:00:: , City of San Francisco , stopped in Ogden---location%1:03:00:: , Utah---location%1:03:00:: , for a few minutes---minute%1:28:00:: .
Sports Writer---sports_writer%1:18:00:: Ensign Ritchie---person%1:03:00:: of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment---compartment%1:06:00:: to talk with him .
The conductor---conductor%1:18:01:: said to Ritchie---person%1:03:00:: : `` I do n't think you want to talk to him .
You 'll probably get a ball---ball%1:06:01:: bat on the head---head%1:08:00:: .
He 's mad at the world---world%1:17:01:: '' .
But Jackie---person%1:03:00:: had gone into the station---station%1:06:00:: .
Ritchie---person%1:03:00:: walked up to him at the magazine---magazine%1:10:00:: stand---stand%1:06:04:: .
But he warmed up after a while---while%1:28:00:: .
I told him what Liston---person%1:03:00:: had said and he said Liston---person%1:03:00:: was a double-crosser---double-crosser%1:18:00:: and said anything he ( Liston---person%1:03:00:: ) got was through a keyhole---keyhole%1:06:00:: .
He said he had never talked to Liston---person%1:03:00:: '' .
Liston---person%1:03:00:: is Bill Liston---person%1:03:00:: , baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: writer---writer%1:18:00:: for the Boston Traveler---group%1:03:00:: , who quoted Jensen---person%1:03:00:: as saying :
Suddenly my reflexes---reflex%1:04:00:: are gone .
Just when it seems baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: might be losing its grip---grip%1:04:00:: on the masses---masses%1:14:00:: up pops heroics---heroics%1:04:00:: to start millions of tongues---tongue%1:08:00:: to wagging .
And so it was over the weekend---weekend%1:28:00:: what with 40 - year---year%1:28:01:: old Warren Spahn---person%1:03:00:: pitching his no-hit masterpiece---masterpiece%1:04:00:: against the Giants---group%1:03:00:: and the Giants---group%1:03:00:: ' Willie Mays---person%1:03:00:: retaliating with a record---record%1:04:00:: tying 4 - homer---homer%1:04:00:: spree---spree%1:04:00:: Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: .
Both , of course , were remarkable feats---feat%1:04:00:: and further embossed the fact---fact%1:09:01:: that baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: rightfully is the national pastime---pastime%1:04:00:: .
Of the two cherished achievements---achievement%1:04:00:: the elderly Spahn---person%1:03:00:: 's hitless pitching---pitching%1:04:00:: probably reached the most hearts---heart%1:09:00:: .
It was a real stimulant---stimulant%1:09:00:: to a lot of guys---guy%1:18:00:: I know who have moved past the 2 - score---score%1:14:00:: year---year%1:28:01:: milestone---milestone%1:10:01:: .
And one of the Milwaukee---group%1:03:00:: rookies---rookie%1:18:00:: sighed and remarked , `` Wish I was 40 , and a top grade---grade%1:26:00:: big leaguer---big_leaguer%1:18:00:: .
THE MODEST AND HAPPY Spahn---person%1:03:00:: waved off his new laurels---laurels%1:10:00:: as one of those good days---day%1:28:03:: .
But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw---southpaw%1:18:01:: belonging with the all time great lefthanders---left-hander%1:18:01:: in the game---game%1:04:00:: 's history---history%1:28:00:: .
Yes , with Bob Grove---person%1:03:00:: , Carl Hubbell---person%1:03:00:: , Herb Pennock---person%1:03:00:: , Art Nehf---person%1:03:00:: , Vernon Gomez---person%1:03:00:: , et al .
Spahn---person%1:03:00:: not only is a superior pitcher---pitcher%1:18:00:: but a gentlemanly fine fellow---fellow%1:18:00:: , a ball player---ballplayer%1:18:00:: 's ball player---ballplayer%1:18:00:: , as they say in the trade---trade%1:14:00:: .
I remember his beardown performance---performance%1:04:00:: in a meaningless exhibition game---exhibition_game%1:04:00:: at Bears Stadium---location%1:03:00:: Oct.---oct%1:28:00:: 14 , 1951 , before a new record crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: for the period---period%1:28:00:: of 18792 .
`` Spahnie---person%1:03:00:: does n't know how to merely go through the motions '' , remarked Enos Slaughter---person%1:03:00:: , another all-out guy---guy%1:18:00:: , who played rightfield---rightfield%1:06:00:: that day---day%1:28:01:: and popped one over the clubhouse---clubhouse%1:06:00:: .
The spectacular Mays---person%1:03:00:: , who reaches a decade---decade%1:28:00:: in the big leagues---big_league%1:14:00:: come May---may%1:28:00:: 25 , joined six other sluggers---slugger%1:18:00:: who walloped four home runs---home_run%1:04:00:: in a span---span%1:28:00:: of nine innings---inning%1:28:00:: .
Incidentally , only two did it before a home audience---audience%1:14:00:: .
Bobby Lowe---person%1:03:00:: of Boston---boston%1:15:00:: was the first to hit four at home---home%1:06:02:: and Gil Hodges---person%1:03:00:: turned the trick in Brooklyn---brooklyn%1:15:00:: 's Ebbetts Field---location%1:03:00:: .
Ed Delahanty---person%1:03:00:: and Chuck Klein---person%1:03:00:: of the Phillies---group%1:03:00:: , the Braves---group%1:03:00:: ' Joe Adcock---person%1:03:00:: , Lou Gehrig---person%1:03:00:: of the Yankees---group%1:03:00:: , Pat Seerey---person%1:03:00:: of the White Sox---group%1:03:00:: and Rocky Colavito---person%1:03:00:: , then with Cleveland---group%1:03:00:: , made their history---history%1:28:00:: on the road---on_the_road%1:04:00:: .
Willie---person%1:03:00:: 's big day---day%1:28:01:: revived the running argument---argument%1:10:01:: about the relative merits---merit%1:07:02:: of Mays---person%1:03:00:: and Mickey Mantle---person%1:03:00:: .
This is an issue---issue%1:09:01:: which boils down to a matter---matter%1:09:01:: of opinion---opinion%1:09:00:: , depending on whether you 're an American---group%1:03:00:: or National---group%1:03:00:: fan---fan%1:18:01:: and anti or pro Yankee---group%1:03:00:: .
The record books , however , would favor the Giants---group%1:03:00:: ' ace---ace%1:18:00:: .
In four of his nine previous seasons---season%1:28:02:: Mays---person%1:03:00:: hit as many as 25 home runs---home_run%1:04:00:: and stole as many as 25 bases---base%1:06:02:: .
Once the figure---figure%1:23:00:: was 30 - 30 .
Willie---person%1:03:00:: 's lifetime---lifetime%1:28:00:: batting---batting%1:04:00:: average---average%1:09:00:: of .318 is 11 points---point%1:23:01:: beyond Mickey's---person%1:03:00:: .
The Giants---group%1:03:00:: who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park---location%1:03:00:: suddenly found the formula---formula%1:10:01:: in Milwaukee---milwaukee%1:15:00:: 's park---park%1:06:00:: .
It will forever be a baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: mystery---mystery%1:09:00:: how a team---team%1:14:00:: will suddenly start hitting---hit%1:04:03:: after a distressing slump---slump%1:22:00:: .
THE DENVER-AREA TV audience---tv_audience%1:14:00:: was privileged to see Mays---person%1:03:00:: ' four home runs---home_run%1:04:00:: , thanks to a new arrangement---arrangement%1:09:01:: made by Bob Howsam---person%1:03:00:: that the games---game%1:04:00:: are not to be blacked out when his Bears---group%1:03:00:: are playing at home .
This rule---rule%1:09:00:: providing for a blackout---blackout%1:28:00:: of televised baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: 30 minutes---30_minutes%1:28:00:: before the start---start%1:28:00:: of a major---major_league%1:14:00:: or minor league---minor_league%1:14:00:: game---game%1:04:00:: in any area---area%1:15:01:: comes from the game---game%1:04:00:: 's top rulers---ruler%1:18:00:: .
The last couple---couple%1:23:00:: of years---year%1:28:01:: the Bears---group%1:03:00:: management---management%1:14:00:: got the business from the `` Living Room Athletic Club---group%1:03:00:: '' when games---game%1:04:00:: were cut off .
Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy---policy%1:09:00:: .
This year---year%1:28:01:: , I am told , the CBS---group%1:03:00:: network---network%1:14:00:: will continue to abide by the rule---rule%1:09:00:: but NBC---group%1:03:00:: will play to a conclusion---conclusion%1:09:00:: here .
There are two more Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: afternoons---afternoon%1:28:00:: when the situation---situation%1:26:00:: will arise .
It is an irritable rule---rule%1:09:00:: that does baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: more harm---harm%1:11:01:: than good---good%1:07:01:: , especially at the minor league---minor_league%1:14:00:: level---level%1:26:00:: .
You would be surprised how many fans---fan%1:18:01:: purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium---location%1:03:00:: last year---year%1:28:01:: because of the television---television%1:10:00:: policy---policy%1:09:00:: .
This dissatisfaction---dissatisfaction%1:12:00:: led to Howsam---person%1:03:00:: 's request---request%1:10:01:: that the video---video%1:06:00:: not be terminated before the end---end%1:11:00:: of the game---game%1:04:00:: .
The powerful New York---new_york%1:15:01:: Yankees---group%1:03:00:: won their 19th world series---world_series%1:11:00:: in a 5 - game---game%1:04:00:: romp---romp%1:11:00:: over outclassed Cincinnati---group%1:03:00:: , crushing the Reds---group%1:03:00:: in a humiliating 13 - 5 barrage---barrage%1:04:00:: Monday---monday%1:28:00:: in the loosely played finale .
With Mickey Mantle---person%1:03:00:: and Yogi Berra---person%1:03:00:: both out of action due to injuries---injury%1:26:00:: , the American League---group%1:03:00:: champs---champ%1:18:00:: still mounted a 15 - hit---hit%1:04:03:: attack---attack%1:04:04:: against a parade---parade%1:14:02:: of eight Cincinnati---group%1:03:00:: pitchers---pitcher%1:18:00:: , the most ever used by one team---team%1:14:00:: in a series---series%1:11:00:: game---game%1:04:00:: .
Johnny Blanchard---person%1:03:00:: , Mantle---person%1:03:00:: 's replacement---replacement%1:18:02:: , slammed a 2 - run---run%1:04:01:: homer---homer%1:04:00:: as the Yankees---group%1:03:00:: routed loser---loser%1:18:01:: Joey Jay---person%1:03:00:: in a 5 - run---run%1:04:01:: first inning---inning%1:28:00:: .
Hector Lopez---person%1:03:00:: , subbing for Berra---person%1:03:00:: , smashed a 3 - run---run%1:04:01:: homer---homer%1:04:00:: off Bill Henry---person%1:03:00:: during another 5 - run---run%1:04:01:: explosion---explosion%1:04:00:: in the fourth .
The Yanks---group%1:03:00:: also took advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: of three Cincinnati---group%1:03:00:: errors---error%1:04:03:: .
The crowd---crowd%1:14:00:: of 32589 had only two chances---chance%1:26:00:: to applaud .
In the third Frank Robinson---person%1:03:00:: hammered a long home run---home_run%1:04:00:: deep into the corner---corner%1:15:02:: of the bleachers---bleachers%1:06:00:: in right---right%1:06:00:: center---center%1:06:02:: , about 400 feet---foot%1:23:00:: away , with two men---man%1:18:00:: on .
Momentarily the Reds---group%1:03:00:: were back in the ball game---ball_game%1:04:00:: , trailing only 6 - 3 , but the drive---drive%1:04:02:: fizzled when John Edwards---person%1:03:00:: fouled out with men---man%1:18:00:: on second and third and two out .
In the fifth , Wally Post---person%1:03:00:: slashed a 2 - run---run%1:04:01:: homer---homer%1:04:00:: off Bud Daley---person%1:03:00:: , but by that time---time%1:11:00:: the score---score%1:23:00:: was 11 - 5 and it really did n't matter .
The Yankee---group%1:03:00:: triumph---triumph%1:11:00:: made Ralph Houk---person%1:03:00:: only the third man---man%1:18:00:: to lead a team---team%1:14:00:: to both a pennant---pennant%1:10:01:: and a World Series---world_series%1:11:00:: victory---victory%1:11:00:: in his first year---year%1:28:01:: as a manager---manager%1:18:01:: .
Only Bucky Harris---person%1:03:00:: , the `` boy---boy%1:18:00:: manager---manager%1:18:01:: '' of Washington---group%1:03:00:: in 1924 , and Eddie Dyer---person%1:03:00:: of the St. Louis---st._louis%1:15:00:: Cardinals---group%1:03:00:: in 1946 had accomplished the feat---feat%1:04:00:: .
A variety---variety%1:14:01:: of techniques---technique%1:09:00:: have been directed toward the isolation---isolation%1:26:00:: and study---study%1:04:00:: of blood group antibodies---antibody%1:27:00:: .
These include low-temperature---low_temperature%1:07:00:: ethanol---ethanol%1:27:00:: ( Cohn---person%1:03:00:: ) fractionation---fractionation%1:04:00:: , electrophoresis---electrophoresis%1:22:00:: , ultracentrifugation---ultracentrifugation%1:22:00:: and column chromatography---column_chromatography%1:22:00:: on ion exchange---ion_exchange%1:22:00:: celluloses---cellulose%1:27:00:: .
Modifications---modification%1:04:00:: of the last technique---technique%1:09:00:: have been applied by several groups---group%1:03:00:: of investigators---investigator%1:18:01:: .
Abelson---person%1:03:00:: and Rawson---person%1:03:00:: , using a stepwise elution---elution%1:22:00:: scheme---scheme%1:09:00:: , fractionated whole sera---serum%1:08:00:: containing ABO---abo_antibodies%1:27:00:: and Rh antibodies---rh_antibody%1:27:00:: on diethylaminoethyl---diethylaminoethyl_cellulose%1:27:00:: DEAE cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: and carboxymethyl cellulose---carboxymethyl_cellulose%1:27:00:: .
Speer---person%1:03:00:: and coworkers---co-worker%1:18:00:: , in a similar study---study%1:04:00:: of blood group antibodies---antibody%1:27:00:: of whole sera---serum%1:08:00:: , used a series---series%1:14:00:: of gradients---gradient%1:24:00:: for elution---elution%1:22:00:: from DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: .
Fahey---person%1:03:00:: and Morrison---person%1:03:00:: used a single , continuous gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: at constant pH---ph%1:07:00:: for the fractionation---fractionation%1:04:00:: of anti - A and anti - B agglutinins---agglutinin%1:27:00:: from preisolated | g-globulin---gamma_globulin%1:27:00:: samples---sample%1:09:00:: .
In the present work---work%1:06:00:: whole sera---serum%1:08:00:: have been fractionated by chromatography---chromatography%1:22:00:: on DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: using single gradients---gradient%1:24:00:: similar to those described by Sober---person%1:03:00:: and Peterson---person%1:03:00:: , and certain chemical---chemical%1:27:00:: and serological properties---property%1:07:00:: of the fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: containing antibodies---antibody%1:27:00:: of the ABO---abo%1:18:00:: and Rh---rh%1:27:01:: systems---system%1:14:00:: have been described .
Serum---serum%1:08:00:: samples---sample%1:09:00:: were obtained from normal group---group%1:03:00:: A , group---group%1:03:00:: B and group---group%1:03:00:: O donors---donor%1:18:00:: .
Three of the anti - Rh---rh%1:27:01:: sera---serum%1:08:00:: used were taken from recently sensitized individuals---individual%1:18:00:: .
One contained complete antibody---antibody%1:27:00:: and had a titer---titer%1:07:00:: of 1 : 512 in saline---saline%1:27:00:: .
The second contained incomplete antibody---antibody%1:27:00:: and showed titers---titer%1:07:00:: of 1 : 256 in albumin---albumin%1:27:00:: and 1 : 2048 by the indirect Coombs test .
The third , containing the mixed type---type%1:09:00:: of complete and incomplete antibodies---antibody%1:27:00:: , had titers---titer%1:07:00:: of 1 : 256 in saline---saline%1:27:00:: , 1 : 512 in albumin---albumin%1:27:00:: and 1 : 1024 by the indirect Coombs test .
In addition one serum---serum%1:08:00:: was obtained from a donor---donor%1:18:00:: ( R. E.---person%1:03:00:: . ) who had been sensitized 6 years---year%1:28:01:: previously .
This serum---serum%1:08:00:: exhibited titers---titer%1:07:00:: of 1 : 16 in albumin---albumin%1:27:00:: and 1 : 256 by the indirect Coombs test .
These antibody---antibody%1:27:00:: titers---titer%1:07:00:: were determined by reaction---reaction%1:22:00:: with homozygous * * f red cells---red_blood_cell%1:08:00:: .
Anti - A and anti - B activities---activity%1:26:00:: were determined in fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: from the sera---serum%1:08:00:: of group---group%1:03:00:: A , group---group%1:03:00:: B or group---group%1:03:00:: O donors---donor%1:18:00:: by the following tube---tube%1:06:00:: agglutination---agglutination%1:22:01:: methods---method%1:09:00:: .
One drop---drop%1:23:00:: of each sample---sample%1:09:00:: was added to one drop---drop%1:23:00:: of a 2 % suspension---suspension%1:27:00:: of group---group%1:03:00:: * * f or group---group%1:03:00:: B red cells---red_blood_cell%1:08:00:: in a small * * f test tube---test_tube%1:06:00:: .
In several instances---instance%1:09:00:: group---group%1:03:00:: O cells---cell%1:03:00:: were also used as controls---control%1:09:02:: .
The red cells---red_blood_cell%1:08:00:: were used within 2 days---day%1:28:00:: after donation---donation%1:21:00:: and were washed with large amounts---amount%1:03:00:: of saline---saline%1:27:00:: before use---use%1:04:02:: .
The mixtures---mixture%1:27:00:: of sample---sample%1:09:00:: plus cell---cell%1:03:00:: suspension---suspension%1:27:00:: were allowed to stand at room temperature---room_temperature%1:07:00:: for 1 hr---hr%1:28:00:: .
the tubes---tube%1:06:00:: were then centrifuged at 1000 rpm---rpm%1:28:00:: for 1 min---min%1:28:00:: and examined macroscopically for agglutination---agglutination%1:22:01:: .
For the albumin---albumin%1:27:00:: method---method%1:09:00:: , equal volumes---volume%1:23:00:: of 30 % bovine albumin---albumin%1:27:00:: , sample---sample%1:09:00:: and 2 % cells---cell%1:03:00:: suspended in saline---saline%1:27:00:: were allowed to stand at room temperature---room_temperature%1:07:00:: for 1 hr---hr%1:28:00:: and then were centrifuged at 1000 rpm---rpm%1:28:00:: for 1 min---min%1:28:00:: .
All samples---sample%1:09:00:: were tested by both the saline---saline%1:27:00:: and albumin---albumin%1:27:00:: methods---method%1:09:00:: .
The activities---activity%1:04:00:: of fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: of sera---serum%1:08:00:: containing Rh antibodies---rh_antibody%1:27:00:: were tested by the saline---saline%1:27:00:: , albumin---albumin%1:27:00:: and indirect Coombs techniques---technique%1:09:00:: .
Homozygous and heterozygous * * f cells---cell%1:03:00:: , * * f and homozygous and heterozygous * * f cells---cell%1:03:00:: were used to test each sample---sample%1:09:00:: ; however , in the interest---interest%1:07:01:: of clarity---clarity%1:07:01:: and conciseness---conciseness%1:10:00:: only the results---result%1:10:00:: obtained with homozygous * * f and homozygous * * f cells---cell%1:03:00:: will be presented here .
The saline---saline%1:27:00:: and albumin---albumin%1:27:00:: tests---test%1:09:02:: were performed as described for the ABO---abo%1:18:00:: samples---sample%1:09:00:: except that the mixture---mixture%1:27:00:: was incubated for 1 hr---hr%1:28:00:: at 37 ` C---c%1:23:02:: before centrifugation---centrifugation%1:22:00:: .
The saline---saline%1:27:00:: tubes---tube%1:06:00:: were saved and used for the indirect Coombs test in the following manner---manner%1:07:02:: .
The cells---cell%1:03:00:: were washed three times---time%1:11:00:: with saline---saline%1:27:00:: , anti human---human%1:05:00:: serum---serum%1:08:00:: was added , the cells---cell%1:03:00:: were resuspended , and the mixture---mixture%1:27:00:: was centrifuged at 1000 rpm---rpm%1:28:00:: for 1 min---min%1:10:00:: and examined for agglutination---agglutination%1:22:00:: .
The anti human---human%1:05:00:: sera---serum%1:08:00:: used were prepared by injecting whole human serum---serum%1:08:00:: into rabbits---rabbit%1:05:00:: .
Those antisera---antiserum%1:08:00:: shown by immunoelectrophoresis---immunoelectrophoresis%1:22:00:: to be of the `` broad spectrum---spectrum%1:07:00:: '' type---type%1:09:00:: were selected for used in the present study---study%1:09:04:: .
The red cells---red_blood_cell%1:08:00:: for the Rh antibody---rh_antibody%1:27:00:: tests---test%1:09:02:: were used within 3 days---day%1:28:00:: after drawing except for the * * f cells---cell%1:03:00:: , which had been glycerolized and stored at - 20 ` C---c%1:23:02:: for approximately 1 year---year%1:28:01:: .
These cells---cell%1:03:00:: were thawed at 37 ` C---c%1:23:02:: for 30 min---min%1:28:00:: and were deglycerolized by alternately centrifuging and mixing with descending concentrations---concentration%1:07:02:: of glycerol---glycerol%1:27:00:: solutions---solution%1:27:00:: ( 20 , 18 , 10 , 8 , 4 and 2 % ) .
The cells---cell%1:03:00:: were then washed three times---time%1:11:00:: with saline---saline%1:27:00:: and resuspended to 2 % in saline---saline%1:27:00:: .
Blood---blood%1:08:00:: samples---sample%1:09:00:: were allowed to clot at room temperature---room_temperature%1:07:00:: for 3 hr---hr%1:28:00:: , centrifuged and the serum---serum%1:08:00:: was removed .
The serum---serum%1:08:00:: was measured volumetrically and subsequently dialyzed in the cold---cold%1:07:00:: for at least 24 hr---hr%1:28:00:: against three to four changes---change%1:06:01:: , approximately 750 ml---ml%1:23:00:: each , of `` starting buffer---starting_buffer%1:27:00:: '' .
This buffer---buffer%1:27:00:: , pH---ph%1:07:00:: 8.6 , was 0.005 M---m%1:07:00:: in * * f and 0.039 M---m%1:07:00:: in tris ( hydroxymethyl---hydroxymethyl%1:27:00:: ) - aminomethane---aminomethane%1:27:00:: ( Tris ) .
After dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: the sample---sample%1:09:00:: was centrifuged and the supernatant placed on a * * f cm---cm%1:23:00:: column---column%1:06:02:: of DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: equilibrated with starting buffer---starting_buffer%1:27:00:: .
The DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: , containing 0.78 mEq---meq%1:07:00:: of N / g---g%1:23:00:: , was prepared in our laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: by the method---method%1:09:00:: of Peterson---person%1:03:00:: and Sober---person%1:03:00:: ( 7 ) from powdered cellulose---cellulose%1:27:00:: , 100 - 230 mesh---mesh%1:23:00:: .
The small amount---amount%1:07:00:: of insoluble material---material%1:27:00:: which precipitated during dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: was suspended in approximately 5 ml---ml%1:23:00:: of starting buffer---starting_buffer%1:27:00:: , centrifuged , resuspended in 2.5 ml---ml%1:23:00:: of isotonic saline---saline%1:27:00:: and tested for antibody---antibody%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: .
The chromatography---chromatography%1:22:00:: was done at 6 ` C---c%1:23:02:: using gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: elution---elution%1:22:00:: , essentially according to Sober---person%1:03:00:: and Peterson---person%1:03:00:: .
The deep concave gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: employed ( fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 2 ) was obtained with a nine chambered gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: elution---elution%1:22:00:: device---device%1:06:00:: ( `` Varigrad '' , reference---reference%1:10:03:: ( 8 ) ) and has been described elsewhere .
the other , a shallow concave gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: ( Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 1 ) , was produced with a so-called `` cone---cone%1:06:00:: sphere---sphere%1:06:00:: '' apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: , the `` cone---cone%1:06:00:: '' being a 2 - liter---liter%1:23:00:: Erlenmeyer flask---erlenmeyer_flask%1:06:00:: and the `` sphere---sphere%1:06:00:: , '' a 2 - liter---liter%1:23:00:: round-bottom flask---flask%1:06:00:: .
Each initially contained 1700 ml---ml%1:23:00:: of buffer---buffer%1:27:00:: ; in the sphere---sphere%1:06:00:: was starting buffer---buffer%1:27:00:: and in the cone---cone%1:06:00:: was final buffer---buffer%1:27:00:: , 0.50 M---m%1:07:00:: in both * * f and Tris , pH---ph%1:07:00:: 4.1 .
A flow rate---flow_rate%1:28:00:: of 72 * * f was used and 12 ml---ml%1:23:00:: fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: were collected .
Approximately 165 fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: were obtained from each column---column%1:25:02:: .
These were read at 280 m---m%1:23:00:: | m---m%1:23:00:: in a Beckman model---model%1:09:03:: DU spectrophotometer---spectrophotometer%1:06:00:: and tested for antibody---antibody%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: as described above .
For protein---protein%1:27:00:: identification---identification%1:04:00:: , fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: from the column---column%1:25:02:: were concentrated by pervaporation---pervaporation%1:04:00:: against a stream---stream%1:11:00:: of air---air%1:27:00:: at 5 ` C---c%1:23:02:: or by negative pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: in an apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: which permitted simultaneous concentration---concentration%1:04:01:: of the protein---protein%1:27:00:: and dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: against isotonic saline---saline%1:27:00:: .
During the latter procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: the temperature---temperature%1:07:00:: was maintained at 2 ` C---c%1:23:02:: by surrounding the apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: with ice---ice%1:27:00:: .
Because negative pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: gave better recovery---recovery%1:04:00:: of proteins---protein%1:27:00:: , permitted detection---detection%1:09:00:: of proteins---protein%1:27:00:: concentrated from very dilute solutions---solution%1:27:00:: and was a gentler procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: , it was used in all but the earliest experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: .
Paper electrophoresis---paper_electrophoresis%1:22:00:: was carried out on the concentrated samples---sample%1:09:00:: in a Spinco model---model%1:09:03:: R cell---cell%1:03:00:: using barbital---barbital%1:06:00:: buffer---buffer%1:27:00:: , pH---ph%1:07:00:: 8.6 , ionic strength---strength%1:07:00:: 0.075 , at room temperature---room_temperature%1:07:00:: on Whatman 3 MM filter paper---filter_paper%1:27:00:: .
Five milliamperes---milliampere%1:23:00:: / cell---cell%1:03:00:: were applied for 18 hr---hr%1:28:00:: , after which the strips---strip%1:06:00:: were stained with bromophenol blue---bromophenol_blue%1:27:00:: and densitometry---densitometry%1:04:00:: was carried out using a Spinco Analytrol .
When paper electrophoresis---paper_electrophoresis%1:22:00:: was to be used for preparation---preparation%1:04:02:: , eight strips---strip%1:06:00:: of a whole serum---serum%1:08:00:: sample---sample%1:09:00:: or a chromatographic fraction---fraction%1:27:00:: concentrated by negative pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: were run / chamber---chamber%1:06:00:: under the conditions---condition%1:26:00:: described above .
At the end---end%1:11:00:: of the run---run%1:04:06:: , the strips---strip%1:06:00:: in the third and sixth positions---position%1:15:00:: in each chamber---chamber%1:06:00:: were dried , stained for 1 hr---hr%1:28:00:: , washed and dried , while the other strips---strip%1:06:00:: were maintained in a horizontal position---position%1:15:00:: at 1 ` C---c%1:23:02:: .
The unstained strips---strip%1:06:00:: were then marked , using the stained ones as a guide---guide%1:09:00:: , and cut transversely so as to separate the various protein---protein%1:27:00:: bands---band%1:07:00:: .
The strip---strip%1:06:00:: sections---section%1:06:00:: containing a given protein---protein%1:27:00:: were pooled , eluted with 0.5 ml---ml%1:23:00:: of isotonic saline---saline%1:27:00:: , and the eluates---eluate%1:27:00:: were tested for antibody---antibody%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: .
Fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: from the column---column%1:25:02:: which were to be subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation---ultracentrifugation%1:22:00:: were concentrated by negative pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: and dialyzed for 16 hr---hr%1:28:00:: in the cold---cold%1:07:00:: against at least 500 volumes---volume%1:23:00:: of phosphate---phosphate%1:27:00:: buffered saline---saline%1:27:00:: , pH---ph%1:07:00:: 7.2 , ionic strength---strength%1:07:00:: 0.154 .
They were then centrifuged at 59780 rpm---rpm%1:28:00:: for 35 to 80 min---min%1:10:00:: at 20 ` C---c%1:23:02:: in a Spinco model---model%1:09:03:: E ultracentrifuge---ultracentrifuge%1:06:00:: at a protein---protein%1:27:00:: concentration---concentration%1:07:02:: of 1.00 to 1.25 % .
Sedimentation---sedimentation%1:19:00:: coefficients---coefficient%1:23:00:: were computed as * * f values---value%1:09:00:: and relative amounts---amount%1:03:00:: of the various components---component%1:24:00:: were calculated from the Schlieren patterns---pattern%1:09:00:: .
For preparative ultracentrifugation---ultracentrifugation%1:22:00:: , fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: from the column---column%1:06:02:: were concentrated by negative pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: to volumes---volume%1:23:00:: of 1 ml---ml%1:23:00:: or less , transferred to cellulose---cellulose%1:27:00:: tubes---tube%1:06:00:: and diluted to 12 ml---ml%1:23:00:: with isotonic saline---saline%1:27:00:: .
Ultracentrifugation---ultracentrifugation%1:22:00:: was then carried out in a Spinco model---model%1:09:03:: L ultracentrifuge---ultracentrifuge%1:06:00:: at 40000 rpm---rpm%1:28:00:: for 125 to 150 min---min%1:28:00:: , refrigeration---refrigeration%1:22:00:: being used throughout the run---run%1:04:06:: .
Successive 1 - ml---ml%1:23:00:: fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: were then drawn off with a hypodermic syringe---hypodermic_syringe%1:06:00:: , starting at the top---top%1:15:00:: of the tube---tube%1:06:00:: , and tested for agglutinin---agglutinin%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: .
Other methods---method%1:09:00:: will be described below .
The insoluble material---material%1:27:00:: which precipitated during dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: against starting buffer---starting_buffer%1:27:00:: always showed intense agglutinin---agglutinin%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: , regardless of the blood group of the donor---donor%1:18:00:: .
With either of the gradients---gradient%1:24:00:: described , chromatography---chromatography%1:22:00:: on DEAE-cellulose---deae_cellulose%1:27:00:: separated agglutinins---agglutinin%1:27:00:: of the ABO series---series%1:14:00:: into at least three regions---region%1:15:00:: ( Figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 1 and 2 ) :
one of extremely low anionic binding---binding%1:07:00:: capacity---capacity%1:26:00:: , one of low anionic---anionic%1:27:00:: binding capacity---capacity%1:26:00:: and one---one%1:23:00:: of high anionic---anionic%1:27:00:: binding capacity---capacity%1:26:00:: .
These have been labeled Regions---region%1:15:00:: 1 , 2 , and 4 , respectively , in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 1 .
When the early part---part%1:24:00:: of the gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: was flattened , either by using the gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: shown in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 2 or by allowing the `` cone---cone%1:06:00:: sphere---sphere%1:06:00:: '' gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: to become established more slowly , Region---region%1:15:00:: 2 activity---activity%1:26:00:: could sometimes be separated into two areas---area%1:15:01:: ( donors---donor%1:18:00:: P. J.---person%1:03:00:: and R. S.---person%1:03:00:: , Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 1 and E. M.---person%1:03:00:: , Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 2 ) .
The latter procedure---procedure%1:04:00:: gave rise to a small active protein---protein%1:27:00:: peak---peak%1:26:00:: ( Region---region%1:15:00:: 1a ) between Regions---region%1:15:00:: 1 and 2 .
In 2 of 15 experiments---experiment%1:04:00:: on whole serum---serum%1:08:00:: a region---region%1:15:00:: of agglutinin---agglutinin%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: with intermediate anionic---anionic%1:27:00:: binding capacity---capacity%1:26:00:: was detected ( Region---region%1:15:00:: 3 , Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 1 ) .
Moreover , after concentration---concentration%1:04:01:: using negative pressure---pressure%1:19:00:: dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: , agglutinin---agglutinin%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: could sometimes be detected in the region---region%1:15:00:: designated 2a ( donors---donor%1:18:00:: P. J.---person%1:03:00:: , D. A.---person%1:03:00:: , and J. F.---person%1:03:00:: , Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 1 ) .
Not all these regions---region%1:15:00:: exhibited equal agglutinating activity---agglutinating_activity%1:22:00:: , as evidenced by titer---titer%1:07:00:: and the extent---extent%1:07:00:: of the active areas---area%1:15:01:: .
In all cases---case%1:11:00:: , most of the activity---activity%1:26:00:: lay in the region---region%1:15:00:: of high anionic---anionic%1:27:00:: binding capacity---capacity%1:26:00:: .
This was particularly noticeable in group---group%1:03:00:: A and group---group%1:03:00:: B sera---serum%1:08:00:: , in which cases---case%1:26:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: in Regions---region%1:15:00:: 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration---concentration%1:04:01:: and occasionally could not be detected at all .
This was particularly noticeable in group A and group B sera , in which cases---case%1:11:00:: activity in Regions 1 and 2 was usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detected at all .
There appeared to be no difference---difference%1:11:00:: in the distribution---distribution%1:09:00:: of anti - A and anti - B activity---activity%1:26:00:: in group---group%1:03:00:: O serum---serum%1:08:00:: , though in two group---group%1:03:00:: O donors---donor%1:18:00:: ( J. F.---person%1:03:00:: and E. M. ) only one type---type%1:09:00:: of agglutinin---agglutinin%1:27:00:: was found in the regions---region%1:15:00:: of low anionic---anionic%1:27:00:: binding capacity---capacity%1:26:00:: ( Figs.---fig%1:10:00:: 1 and 2 ) .
Several samples---sample%1:09:00:: of citrated plasma---plasma%1:08:00:: were fractionated in our laboratory---laboratory%1:06:00:: by Method---method%1:09:00:: 6 of Cohn---person%1:03:00:: et al .
These fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: were tested for ABO agglutinin---agglutinin%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: , using fractions---fraction%1:27:00:: from group---group%1:03:00:: AB plasma---plasma%1:08:00:: as a control---control%1:09:02:: .
As expected , most of the activity---activity%1:26:00:: was found in Fraction---fraction%1:27:00:: * * f , with slight activity---activity%1:26:00:: seen in Fraction---fraction%1:27:00:: 4 , - 1 .
A sample---sample%1:09:00:: of Fraction---fraction%1:27:00:: * * f from group---group%1:03:00:: O plasma---plasma%1:08:00:: was dissolved in starting buffer---starting_buffer%1:27:00:: , dialyzed against this buffer---buffer%1:27:00:: and subjected to chromatography---chromatography%1:22:00:: using the gradient---gradient%1:24:00:: shown in Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 2 .
Once again , both anti - A and anti - B activities---activity%1:26:00:: were found in the insoluble material---material%1:27:00:: precipitated during dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: .
Similarly , both types---type%1:09:00:: of antibodies---antibody%1:27:00:: were found in three regions---region%1:15:00:: of the chromatographic eluate---eluate%1:27:00:: , having extremely low , low , and high anionic---anionic%1:27:00:: binding capacity---capacity%1:26:00:: , respectively ( Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 3 ) .
Chromatography---chromatography%1:22:00:: of whole sera---serum%1:08:00:: revealed that the areas---area%1:15:01:: of Rh antibody---rh_antibody%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: were generally continuous and wide .
The incomplete antibody---antibody%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: appeared in the early part---part%1:24:00:: of the chromatogram---chromatogram%1:06:00:: ; the complete , in the latter part---part%1:24:00:: .
The serum---serum%1:08:00:: containing the mixed type---type%1:09:00:: of complete and incomplete antibodies---antibody%1:27:00:: showed activity---activity%1:26:00:: in both regions---region%1:15:00:: ( Fig.---fig%1:10:00:: 1 ) .
In all cases---case%1:11:00:: the activity---activity%1:26:00:: against * * f cells---cell%1:03:00:: was spread over a wider area---area%1:15:01:: than that with * * f cells---cell%1:03:00:: , regardless of the type---type%1:09:00:: of test---test%1:09:02:: ( saline---saline%1:27:00:: , albumin---albumin%1:27:00:: , indirect Coombs ) used for comparison---comparison%1:24:00:: .
The insoluble material---material%1:27:00:: resulting from dialysis---dialysis%1:04:00:: against starting buffer---starting_buffer%1:27:00:: always showed strong activity---activity%1:26:00:: .
In fact agglutination---agglutination%1:22:01:: of * * f cells---cell%1:03:00:: in saline---saline%1:27:00:: could be produced by the insoluble material---material%1:27:00:: from sera---serum%1:08:00:: containing `` only '' incomplete antibody---antibody%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: .
This was later known to be the result---result%1:19:00:: of concentrating the minute amount---amount%1:07:00:: of complete antibody---antibody%1:27:00:: found in these sera---serum%1:08:00:: ; when the insoluble fraction---fraction%1:27:00:: was suspended in a volume---volume%1:23:00:: of saline---saline%1:27:00:: equal to that of the original serum---serum%1:08:00:: sample---sample%1:09:00:: , no complete antibody---antibody%1:27:00:: activity---activity%1:26:00:: could be detected .
Sizzling temperatures---temperature%1:07:00:: and hot summer---summer%1:28:00:: pavements---pavement%1:06:00:: are anything but kind to the feet---foot%1:08:01:: .
That is why it is important to invest in comfortable , airy types---type%1:09:00:: of shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: .
There are many soft and light shoe leathers---shoe_leather%1:27:00:: available .
Many styles---style%1:09:01:: have perforations---perforation%1:06:00:: and an almost weightlessness---weightlessness%1:07:00:: achieved via unlined leathers---leather%1:27:00:: .
Softness---softness%1:07:00:: is found in crushed textures---texture%1:07:00:: .
Styles---style%1:09:01:: run the gamut---gamut%1:07:00:: from slender and tapered with elongated toes---toe%1:06:00:: to a newer squared toe shape---shape%1:07:00:: .
Heels---heel%1:06:00:: place emphasis---emphasis%1:26:00:: on the long legged silhouette---silhouette%1:15:00:: .
Wine glass---wineglass%1:06:00:: heels---heel%1:06:00:: are to be found in both high and semi-heights .
Stacked heels---stacked_heel%1:06:00:: are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: .
Just the barest suggestion---suggestion%1:23:00:: of a heel---heel%1:06:00:: is found on teenage pumps .
While white---white%1:07:00:: is the coolest summer---summer%1:28:00:: shade---shade%1:07:00:: , there are lots---lots%1:23:00:: of pastel hues---hue%1:07:00:: along with tintable fabrics---fabric%1:06:00:: that will blend with any wardrobe---wardrobe%1:06:01:: color---color%1:07:00:: .
In the tintable group---group%1:03:00:: are high and little heels---heel%1:06:00:: , squared and oval throats---throat%1:06:01:: , and shantung---shantung%1:06:00:: like textures---texture%1:07:00:: .
Do n't overlook the straws---straw%1:27:00:: this year---year%1:28:01:: .
They come in crisp basket weaves---basket_weave%1:06:00:: in natural honey hues---hue%1:07:00:: , along with lacy open weaves---weave%1:06:00:: with a lustre---lustre%1:07:00:: finish---finish%1:07:00:: in natural , white---white%1:07:00:: , black---black%1:07:00:: and a whole range---range%1:07:00:: of colors---color%1:07:00:: .
In the casual field---field%1:26:00:: straws---straw%1:27:00:: feature wedge heels---wedge_heel%1:06:00:: of cork---cork%1:27:00:: or carved wood---wood%1:27:00:: in a variety---variety%1:14:01:: of styles---style%1:09:01:: .
For added comfort---comfort%1:12:00:: some of the Italian designed sandals---sandal%1:06:00:: have foam---foam%1:27:00:: padded cushioning---cushioning%1:06:00:: .
The citrus---citrus%1:13:00:: tones---tone%1:07:00:: popular in clothing---clothing%1:06:00:: are also to be found afoot .
Orange---orange%1:07:00:: and lemon---lemon%1:07:00:: are considered important as are such pastels---pastel%1:07:00:: as blue and lilac .
In a brighter nautical vein---vein%1:10:00:: is Ile de France---ile-de-france%1:15:00:: blue .
Contrast---contrast%1:09:00:: trim---trim%1:06:00:: provides other touches---touch%1:23:00:: of color---color%1:07:00:: .
Spectators---spectator%1:06:00:: in white crush---crush%1:27:00:: textures---texture%1:07:00:: dip toe---toe%1:06:00:: and heel---heel%1:06:00:: in smooth black , navy---navy%1:07:00:: and taffy---taffy%1:13:00:: tan---tan%1:07:00:: .
Designed for summer---summer%1:28:00:: comfort---comfort%1:12:00:: are the shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: illustrated .
At the left---left%1:15:00:: is a pair---pair%1:14:01:: of dressy straw---straw%1:27:00:: pumps in a light , but crisp texture---texture%1:07:00:: .
In a lacy open weave---weave%1:06:00:: shoes---shoe%1:06:00:: have a luster---luster%1:07:01:: finish---finish%1:07:00:: , braided collar---collar%1:06:00:: and bow---bow%1:06:03:: highlight on the squared throat---throat%1:06:01:: .
At right---right%1:15:00:: is a casual style---style%1:09:01:: in a crushed unlined white leather---leather%1:27:00:: .
Flats---flats%1:06:00:: have a scalloped throat---throat%1:06:00:: .
An electric toothbrush---electric_toothbrush%1:06:00:: ( Broxodent ) may soon take its place---place%1:15:03:: next to the electric razor---electric_razor%1:06:00:: in the American bathroom---bathroom%1:06:00:: .
The brush---brush%1:06:00:: moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface---surface%1:06:00:: , including the back---back%1:06:00:: of the teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: .
In addition , the motor---motor%1:06:00:: has the seal of approval---seal_of_approval%1:10:00:: of the Underwriters Laboratories---group%1:03:00:: , which means it is safe .
The unit consists of a small motor---motor%1:06:00:: that goes on as soon as it is plugged in .
The speed---speed%1:28:00:: is controlled by pressing on the two brake---brake%1:06:00:: buttons---button%1:06:01:: located where the index finger---index_finger%1:08:00:: and thumb---thumb%1:08:00:: are placed when holding the motor---motor%1:06:00:: .
The brushes---brush%1:06:00:: can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling---boiling%1:22:00:: and are detachable so that every member---member%1:18:00:: of the family---family%1:14:02:: can have his own .
Most of us brush our teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: by hand .
The same can be said of shaving---shaving%1:04:00:: yet the electric razor---electric_razor%1:06:00:: has proved useful to many men---man%1:18:00:: .
The electric toothbrush---electric_toothbrush%1:06:00:: moves in a vertical direction---direction%1:24:00:: , the way---way%1:07:01:: dentists---dentist%1:18:00:: recommend .
In addition , it is small enough to get into crevices---crevice%1:25:00:: , jacket---jacket%1:06:02:: and crown---crown%1:08:00:: margins---margin%1:25:00:: , malposed anteriors---anterior%1:08:00:: , and the back teeth---back_tooth%1:08:00:: .
The bristles---bristle%1:06:00:: are soft enough to massage the gums---gum%1:08:00:: and not scratch the enamel---enamel%1:08:00:: .
It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job---job%1:04:01:: than ordinary brushing---brushing%1:04:03:: , especially in those who do not brush their teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: properly .
Several dentists---dentist%1:18:00:: and patients---patient%1:18:00:: with special dental problems---problem%1:26:00:: have experimented with the device---device%1:06:00:: .
The results---result%1:11:00:: were good although they are difficult to compare with hand---hand%1:08:00:: brushing---brushing%1:04:03:: , particularly when the individual---individual%1:03:00:: knows how to brush his teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: properly .
The electric gadget---gadget%1:06:00:: is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: and in individuals---individual%1:03:00:: who are elderly , bedfast with a chronic disease---disease%1:26:00:: , or are handicapped by disorders---disorder%1:26:03:: such as cerebral palsy---cerebral_palsy%1:26:00:: or muscular dystrophy---muscular_dystrophy%1:26:00:: .
But for many of us , it will prove an enjoyable luxury---luxury%1:07:00:: .
It is not as convenient as the old type---type%1:09:00:: toothbrush---toothbrush%1:06:00:: and the paste---paste%1:27:01:: tends to shimmy of the bristles---bristle%1:06:00:: .
Since the apparatus---apparatus%1:06:00:: is new , it requires experimentation---experimentation%1:04:00:: and changes---change%1:04:00:: in technique---technique%1:09:00:: .
writes : Does numbness---numbness%1:26:00:: in the left hand---left_hand%1:08:00:: at night---night%1:28:00:: , which awakens the person---person%1:03:00:: , indicate brain tumor---brain_tumor%1:26:00:: ?
This is a common symptom---symptom%1:26:00:: and the cause---cause%1:11:00:: usually is pressure---pressure%1:04:00:: on the nerve---nerve%1:08:00:: leading to the affected hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
The pressure---pressure%1:04:00:: may come from muscles---muscle%1:08:00:: , tendons---tendon%1:08:00:: , or bones---bone%1:08:00:: anywhere from the neck---neck%1:08:00:: to the hand---hand%1:08:00:: .
writes : Do steam baths---steam_bath%1:06:00:: have any health---health%1:26:00:: value---value%1:07:00:: ?
No , other than cleaning out the pores---pore%1:08:00:: and making the sweat glands---sweat_gland%1:08:00:: work harder .
An ordinary hot bath---bath%1:04:00:: or shower---shower%1:04:00:: will do the same .
writes : What makes my hands---hand%1:08:00:: numb when sewing---sewing%1:04:00:: ?
There are many possibilities---possibility%1:09:00:: , including poor circulation---circulation%1:19:00:: , a variety---variety%1:14:01:: of neurological conditions---condition%1:26:00:: , and functional disorders---disorder%1:26:03:: .
This manifestation---manifestation%1:10:00:: may be an early sign---sign%1:10:03:: of multiple sclerosis---multiple_sclerosis%1:26:00:: or the beginning---beginning%1:04:00:: of sewer---sewer%1:18:00:: 's cramp---cramp%1:26:00:: .
writes : Does a brace---brace%1:06:04:: help in sciatica---sciatica%1:26:00:: ?
A back brace---back_brace%1:06:00:: might help , depending upon the cause---cause%1:11:00:: of sciatica---sciatica%1:26:00:: .
writes : Does the cholesterol---cholesterol%1:27:00:: go down when most of the thyroid gland---thyroid_gland%1:08:00:: is removed ?
The cholesterol---cholesterol%1:27:00:: level---level%1:07:00:: in the blood---blood%1:08:00:: is influenced by the glands---gland%1:08:00:: of the body---body%1:08:00:: .
It is low when the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: is overactive and high when the gland---gland%1:08:00:: is sluggish .
The latter is likely to occur when the thyroid---thyroid%1:08:00:: is removed .
The gap---gap%1:06:00:: between the bookshelf---bookshelf%1:06:00:: and the record---record%1:06:00:: cabinet---cabinet%1:06:00:: grows smaller with each new recording---recording%1:06:00:: catalogue---catalogue%1:10:01:: .
There 's more reading---reading%1:10:01:: and instruction---instruction%1:04:00:: to be heard on discs---disc%1:06:01:: than ever before , although the spoken rather than the sung word---word%1:10:00:: is as old as Thomas Alva Edison---person%1:03:00:: 's first experiment---experiment%1:09:00:: in recorded sound---sound%1:19:00:: .
Edison---person%1:03:00:: could hardly have guessed , however , that Sophocles---person%1:03:00:: would one day---day%1:28:03:: appear in stereo---stereo%1:06:00:: .
If the record---record%1:06:00:: buyer---buyer%1:18:00:: 's tastes---taste%1:12:02:: are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit---bit%1:23:01:: esoteric , he will find them satisfied on educational records---record%1:06:00:: .
And he will avoid eye-strain---eyestrain%1:26:00:: in the process---process%1:04:00:: .
Everything from poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: to phonetics---phonetics%1:09:00:: , history---history%1:09:00:: to histrionics---histrionics%1:10:00:: , philosophy---philosophy%1:09:00:: to party games---party_game%1:04:00:: has been adapted to the turntable---turntable%1:06:00:: .
For sheer ambition---ambition%1:07:00:: , take the Decca---group%1:03:00:: series---series%1:10:01:: titled modestly `` Wisdom---wisdom%1:09:02:: '' .
Volumes---volume%1:10:00:: One and Two , selected from the sound tracks---soundtrack%1:06:00:: of a television---television%1:10:00:: series---series%1:10:01:: , contain `` conversations---conversation%1:10:00:: with the elder wise men---wise_man%1:18:00:: of our day---day%1:28:03:: '' .

Hugh Downs---person%1:03:00:: is heard interviewing Wright---person%1:03:00:: , for an added prestige---prestige%1:26:00:: fillip---fillip%1:09:00:: .
There 's more specialization---specialization%1:04:00:: and a narrower purpose---purpose%1:09:00:: in two albums---album%1:10:00:: recently issued by Dover Publications---group%1:03:00:: .
Dover---group%1:03:00:: `` publishes '' what the company---company%1:14:01:: calls `` Listen and Learn '' productions---production%1:10:00:: designed to teach foreign languages---language%1:10:00:: .

But the firm---firm%1:14:00:: has recognized the tight dollar---dollar%1:23:00:: and the tourist---tourist%1:18:00:: 's desire---desire%1:07:00:: to visit the `` smaller , less traveled and relatively inexpensive countries---country%1:15:00:: '' , and is now prepared to teach modern Greek---modern_greek%1:10:00:: and Portuguese---portuguese%1:10:00:: through recordings---recording%1:06:00:: .

For those who `` like poetry---poetry%1:10:02:: but never get around to reading it '' , the Library of Congress---group%1:03:00:: makes it possible for poets---poet%1:18:00:: to be heard reading their own work---work%1:06:00:: .

Two poets---poet%1:18:00:: are paired on each record---record%1:06:00:: , in the order---order%1:14:00:: given above .
Decca---group%1:03:00:: is not the only large commercial company---company%1:14:01:: to impart instruction---instruction%1:04:00:: .
RCA Victor---group%1:03:00:: has an ambitious and useful project---project%1:04:00:: in a stereo---stereo%1:06:00:: series---series%1:10:01:: called `` Adventures---adventure%1:04:00:: in Music---music%1:10:00:: '' , which is an instructional record---record%1:06:00:: library---library%1:14:00:: for elementary schools---elementary_school%1:14:00:: .
Howard Mitchell---person%1:03:00:: and the National Symphony---group%1:03:00:: perform in the first two releases---release%1:06:00:: , designed for grades---grade%1:14:00:: one and two .
Teaching---teaching%1:04:00:: guides---guide%1:10:00:: are included with each record---record%1:06:00:: .
In an effort---effort%1:04:02:: to fortify himself against the unforeseen upsets---upset%1:04:01:: sure to arise in the future---future%1:28:00:: , Herbert A. Leggett---person%1:03:00:: , banker---banker%1:18:00:: editor---editor%1:18:00:: of the Phoenix---phoenix%1:15:00:: `` Arizona Progress---group%1:03:00:: '' , reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences---experience%1:11:00:: of the feverish fifties---fifties%1:28:01:: .
One of the roughest was the TV---tv%1:10:00:: quiz---quiz%1:10:00:: shows---show%1:04:00:: , which gave him inferiority complexes---inferiority_complex%1:12:00:: .
Though it was a great relief---relief%1:26:00:: when the big brains---brain%1:18:00:: on these shows---show%1:04:00:: turned out to be frauds---fraud%1:18:00:: and phonies---phony%1:18:00:: , it did irreparable damage---damage%1:04:00:: to the ego---ego%1:12:01:: of the editor---editor%1:18:00:: and many another intelligent , well-informed American---american%1:18:00:: .
But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer---dancer%1:18:00:: who related in a book---book%1:10:00:: how he parlayed his earnings---earnings%1:21:00:: into a $ 2000000 profit---profit%1:21:00:: on the stock market---stock_market%1:06:00:: .
Every man---man%1:18:00:: who dabbles in the market---market%1:14:01:: to make a little easy money---easy_money%1:21:00:: on the side and suffers losses---losses%1:21:00:: could at the time---time%1:28:06:: hardly face his wife---wife%1:18:00:: who was wondering how her husband---husband%1:18:00:: could be so dumb .
Investors---investor%1:18:00:: breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer---dancer%1:18:00:: had turned magician---magician%1:18:01:: and was only doing a best seller---best_seller%1:10:00:: book---book%1:10:00:: to make some dough---dough%1:21:00:: .
People---people%1:14:00:: who take us for suckers---sucker%1:18:01:: are like the Westerner---westerner%1:18:00:: who had on exhibit---exhibit%1:10:00:: his superior marksmanship---marksmanship%1:09:00:: in the form---form%1:09:00:: of a number---number%1:07:00:: of bull's-eye---bull's_eye%1:04:01:: achievements---achievement%1:04:00:: .
The promoter---promoter%1:18:00:: who wanted to sign him up for the circus---circus%1:14:00:: asked him how he was able to do it .
His answer---answer%1:10:01:: was simple but honest .
He just shot at the board---board%1:27:00:: and then drew circles---circle%1:25:00:: around the holes---hole%1:06:00:: to form a bull's-eye---bull's_eye%1:15:00:: .
One of the obstacles---obstacle%1:09:00:: to the easy control of a 2 - year---year%1:28:01:: old child---child%1:18:01:: is a lack---lack%1:26:00:: of verbal communication---communication%1:10:01:: .
The child---child%1:18:01:: understands no .
He senses his mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's disapproval---disapproval%1:10:00:: .
But explanations---explanation%1:09:00:: leave him confused and unmoved .
If his mother---mother%1:18:00:: loves him , he clings to that love---love%1:12:00:: as a ballast---ballast%1:06:00:: .
It motivates his behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: .
He wants Mommy---mommy%1:18:00:: to think him a good boy---boy%1:18:00:: .
He wants to be called sweet , good , considerate and mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's little helper---helper%1:18:01:: .
But even mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's loving attitude---attitude%1:09:00:: will not always prevent misbehavior---misbehavior%1:04:00:: .
His desires---desire%1:12:00:: are so strong that he needs constant reassurance---reassurance%1:04:00:: of his mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's love---love%1:12:00:: for him and what she expects of him , in order to overcome them .
His own inner voice---voice%1:10:01:: , which should tell him what not to do , has not developed .
It won't develop until he has words---words%1:10:03:: with which to clothe it .
The conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: is non-existent in the 2 - year---year%1:28:01:: old .
What can a mother---mother%1:18:00:: do then to prevent misbehavior---misbehavior%1:04:00:: ?
She can decrease the number---number%1:23:00:: of temptations---temptation%1:09:00:: .
She can remove all knick-knacks within reach---reach%1:04:00:: .
The fewer nos---no%1:10:00:: she has to utter the more effective they will be .
She should offer substitutes---substitute%1:09:00:: for the temptations---temptation%1:09:00:: which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child---child%1:18:01:: .
If he can't play with Mommy---mommy%1:18:00:: 's magazines---magazine%1:10:00:: , he should have some old numbers---number%1:10:00:: of his own .
If Daddy---daddy%1:18:00:: 's books---book%1:10:00:: are out of bounds his own picture books---picture_book%1:06:00:: are not .
Toys---toy%1:06:00:: he has can be made to act as substitutes---substitute%1:09:00:: for family---family%1:14:02:: temptations---temptation%1:09:00:: such as refrigerator---refrigerator%1:06:00:: and gas stove---gas_stove%1:06:00:: .
During this precarious period---period%1:28:00:: of development---development%1:22:01:: the mother---mother%1:18:00:: should continue to influence the growth---growth%1:22:01:: of the child---child%1:18:01:: 's conscience---conscience%1:16:00:: .
She tells him of the consequences---consequence%1:19:00:: of his behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: .
If he bites a playmate---playmate%1:18:00:: she says , `` Danny---person%1:03:00:: won't like you '' .
If he snatches a toy---toy%1:06:00:: , she says , `` Caroline---person%1:03:00:: wants her own truck---truck%1:06:00:: just as you do '' .
There is no use---use%1:07:00:: trying to `` Explain '' to a 2 - year---year%1:28:01:: old .
Actions---action%1:04:02:: speak louder .
Remove temptations---temptation%1:09:00:: .
Remove the child---child%1:18:01:: from the scene---scene%1:15:00:: of his misbehavior---misbehavior%1:04:00:: .
Substitute approved objects---object%1:03:00:: for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act .
He won't submit to his natural desires---desire%1:12:00:: all the time , and it 's Mother---mother%1:18:00:: 's love---love%1:12:00:: that is responsible for his good behavior---behavior%1:04:00:: .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: did not go back to school---school%1:06:00:: .
His parents---parent%1:18:00:: talked seriously and lengthily to their own doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: and to a specialist---specialist%1:18:01:: at the University Hospital---group%1:03:00:: - Mr. McKinley---person%1:03:00:: was entitled to a discount---discount%1:04:00:: for members---member%1:18:00:: of his family---family%1:14:00:: - and it was decided it would be best for him to take the remainder---remainder%1:24:00:: of the term---term%1:28:00:: off , spend a lot of time---time%1:28:05:: in bed---bed%1:06:00:: and , for the rest---rest%1:24:00:: , do pretty much as he chose - provided , of course , he chose to do nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: too exciting or too debilitating .
His teacher---teacher%1:18:00:: and his school principal---school_principal%1:18:00:: were conferred with and everyone agreed that , if he kept up with a certain amount---amount%1:07:00:: of work---work%1:09:00:: at home---home%1:15:04:: , there was little danger---danger%1:26:00:: of his losing a term---term%1:28:00:: .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: accepted the decision---decision%1:04:00:: with indifference---indifference%1:12:01:: and did not enter the arguments---argument%1:10:03:: .
He was discharged from the hospital---hospital%1:06:00:: after a two---two%1:23:00:: day---day%1:28:00:: checkup---checkup%1:04:00:: and he and his parents---parent%1:18:00:: had what Mr. McKinley---person%1:03:00:: described as a `` celebration---celebration%1:11:00:: lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: '' at the cafeteria---cafeteria%1:06:00:: on the campus---campus%1:15:00:: .
Rachel---person%1:03:00:: wore a smart hat---hat%1:06:00:: and , because she had been warned recently about smoking---smoking%1:04:00:: , puffed at her cigarettes---cigarette%1:06:00:: through a long ivory---ivory%1:07:00:: holder---holder%1:06:00:: stained with lipstick---lipstick%1:06:00:: .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: 's father---father%1:18:00:: sat sprawled in his chair---chair%1:06:00:: , angular , alert as a cricket---cricket%1:05:00:: , looking about at the huge stainless-steel---stainless_steel%1:27:00:: appointments---appointment%1:06:00:: of the room---room%1:06:00:: with an expression---expression%1:07:00:: of proprietorship---proprietorship%1:21:00:: .
Teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: - men---man%1:18:00:: who wore brown suits---suit%1:06:00:: and had gray hair---hair%1:08:00:: and pleasant smiles---smile%1:10:00:: - came to their table---table%1:06:01:: to talk shop and to be introduced to Scotty---person%1:03:00:: and Rachel---person%1:03:00:: .
Rachel---person%1:03:00:: was polite , Scotty---person%1:03:00:: indifferent .
They ate the cafeteria---cafeteria%1:06:00:: food---food%1:03:00:: with its orange sauces---sauce%1:13:00:: and Scotty---person%1:03:00:: gazed without interest---interest%1:07:02:: at his food---food%1:03:00:: , the teachers---teacher%1:18:00:: , the heroic baronial windows---window%1:06:00:: , and the bright ranks---rank%1:14:00:: of college---college%1:14:00:: banners---banner%1:06:00:: .
His father---father%1:18:00:: tried to make the food---food%1:03:00:: a topic---topic%1:10:00:: .
`` The blueberry pie---blueberry_pie%1:13:00:: is good , Scotty---person%1:03:00:: .
He looked at his son---son%1:18:00:: , his face---face%1:07:00:: worried .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: murmured , `` No , thanks '' , so softly his father---father%1:18:00:: had to bend his gaunt height---height%1:07:01:: across the table---table%1:06:01:: and turn a round brown ear---ear%1:08:00:: to him .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: regarded the ear---ear%1:08:00:: and the grizzled hair---hair%1:08:00:: around it with a moment---moment%1:28:01:: of interest---interest%1:09:00:: .
He said more loudly , `` I'm full , old Pop---pop%1:18:00:: '' .
He had eaten almost nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: on the crested , three sectioned plate---plate%1:06:00:: and had drunk about half---half%1:23:00:: the milk---milk%1:13:01:: in its paper---paper%1:27:00:: container---container%1:06:00:: .
`` He's all right , Craig---person%1:03:00:: '' , Rachel---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` I can fix him something later in the afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: when we get home---home%1:15:04:: '' .
Since his seizure---seizure%1:26:00:: , Scotty---person%1:03:00:: had had little appetite---appetite%1:12:00:: ; yet his changed appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: , surprisingly , was one of plumpness---plumpness%1:07:00:: .
His face---face%1:08:00:: was fuller ; his lips---lip%1:08:00:: and the usually sharp lines---line%1:25:00:: of his jaw---jaw%1:08:00:: had become swollen looking .
He breathed now with his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: open , showing a whitely curving section---section%1:06:00:: of lower teeth---tooth%1:08:00:: ; he kept his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: , with their puffed blurred lids---lid%1:08:00:: , always lowered , though not , apparently , focusing---focusing%1:09:00:: .
Even his neck---neck%1:08:00:: seemed thicker and therefore shorter .
His hands---hand%1:08:00:: , which had been as quick as a pair---pair%1:23:00:: of fluttering birds---bird%1:05:00:: , were now neither active nor really relaxed .
They lay on his lap---lap%1:08:00:: , palms---palm%1:08:00:: up , stiffly motionless , the tapered fingers---finger%1:08:00:: a little thick at the joints---joint%1:08:00:: .
Altogether he had , since the seizure---seizure%1:26:00:: , the appearance---appearance%1:07:00:: of a boy---boy%1:18:00:: who overindulged in food---food%1:03:00:: and took no exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: .
Rachel---person%1:03:00:: had little to say .
She greeted her husband---husband%1:18:00:: 's colleagues---colleague%1:18:00:: with smiling politeness---politeness%1:07:00:: , offering nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: .
Mr. McKinley---person%1:03:00:: , for all his sprawling---sprawling%1:07:00:: and his easy familiarity---familiarity%1:07:01:: , was completely alert to his son---son%1:18:00:: , eyes---eye%1:08:00:: always on the still face---face%1:08:00:: , jumping to anticipate Scotty 's---person%1:03:00:: desires---desire%1:12:00:: .
It was a strained , silent lunch---lunch%1:13:00:: .
Rachel---person%1:03:00:: said , `` I 'd better get him to bed---bed%1:06:00:: '' .
The doctors---doctor%1:18:00:: had suggested Scotty---person%1:03:00:: remain most of every afternoon---afternoon%1:28:00:: in bed---bed%1:06:00:: until he was stronger .
Since Mr. McKinley---person%1:03:00:: had to give a lecture---lecture%1:10:00:: , Rachel---person%1:03:00:: and Scotty---person%1:03:00:: drove home alone in the Plymouth .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: gazed out at ugly gray slums---slum%1:15:00:: and said softly , `` Look at those stupid kids---kid%1:18:00:: '' .
It was a Negro section---section%1:15:01:: of peeling row houses---row_house%1:06:00:: , store-front---storefront%1:06:00:: churches---church%1:06:00:: and ragged children---child%1:18:00:: .
Rachel---person%1:03:00:: had to bend toward Scotty---person%1:03:00:: and ask him to repeat .
He said , `` Nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: '' .
And then : `` There are lots---lots%1:23:00:: of kids---kid%1:18:00:: around here '' .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: looked at the children---child%1:18:00:: , his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: slightly opened , his eyes---eye%1:08:00:: dull .
The days---day%1:28:01:: seemed short , perhaps because his routine---routine%1:04:00:: was , each day , almost the same .
He rose late and went down in his bathrobe---bathrobe%1:06:00:: and slippers---slipper%1:06:00:: to have breakfast---breakfast%1:13:00:: either alone or with Rachel---person%1:03:00:: .
Virginia---person%1:03:00:: treated him with attention and tried to tempt his appetite---appetite%1:12:00:: with special food---food%1:03:00:: : biscuits---biscuit%1:13:00:: , cookies---cookie%1:13:00:: , candies---candy%1:13:00:: - the result---result%1:11:00:: of devoted hours---hour%1:28:00:: in the tiled kitchen---kitchen%1:06:00:: .
She would hover over him and , looking like her brother---brother%1:18:00:: , anxiously watch the progress---progress%1:11:00:: of Scotty---person%1:03:00:: 's fork---fork%1:06:00:: or spoon---spoon%1:06:00:: .
`` You do n't eat enough , honey---honey%1:18:00:: .
Rachel---person%1:03:00:: , observing , would say , `` He has to rediscover his own capacity---capacity%1:07:00:: .
It 'll take time---time%1:28:05:: '' .
Virginia---person%1:03:00:: and Rachel---person%1:03:00:: talked to each other quietly now , as allies---ally%1:14:00:: who are political rather than natural might in a war---war%1:04:00:: atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: .
Both watched Scotty---person%1:03:00:: constantly , Rachel---person%1:03:00:: without seeming to , Virginia---person%1:03:00:: openly , her eyes---eye%1:08:00:: filled with concern---concern%1:12:00:: .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: was neutral .
He did not resent their supervision---supervision%1:04:00:: or Virginia---person%1:03:00:: 's sometimes tiring sympathy---sympathy%1:12:00:: .
He ate what he felt like , slept as much or as little as he pleased , and moved about the draughty rooms---room%1:06:00:: of the house---house%1:06:00:: , when he was not in bed---bed%1:06:00:: , with slow dubious steps---step%1:23:00:: , like an elderly tourist---tourist%1:18:00:: in a cathedral---cathedral%1:06:00:: .
His energy---energy%1:07:01:: was gone .
He was able , now , to sit for hours---hour%1:28:01:: in a chair---chair%1:06:00:: in the living room---living_room%1:06:00:: and stare---stare%1:04:00:: out at the bleak yard---yard%1:06:02:: without moving .
His hands---hand%1:08:00:: lay loosely , yet stiffly - they were like wax---wax%1:27:00:: hands---hand%1:08:00:: : almost lifelike , not quite - folded in his lap---lap%1:08:00:: ; his mouth---mouth%1:08:01:: hung slightly open .
When he was asked a question---question%1:10:00:: or addressed in such a way---way%1:07:01:: that some response---response%1:10:01:: was inescapable , he would answer ; if , as often happened , he had to repeat because he had spoken too softly , he would repeat his words---word%1:10:03:: in the same way---way%1:07:01:: , without emphasis---emphasis%1:10:01:: or impatience---impatience%1:26:00:: , only a little louder .
He had not mentioned Kate---person%1:03:00:: .
He had not even thought about her much except once or twice at night---night%1:28:00:: in bed---bed%1:06:00:: when his slowly ranging thoughts---thought%1:09:01:: would abruptly , almost accidentally , encounter her .
At these times---time%1:11:00:: he felt a kind---kind%1:09:00:: of pain---pain%1:12:00:: in his upper chest---chest%1:08:00:: , but it was an objective pain---pain%1:12:00:: , in no way different from others in intensity---intensity%1:07:00:: and not different in kind---kind%1:09:00:: ; it was like the bandaged wound---wound%1:26:00:: on the back---back%1:06:00:: of his head---head%1:08:00:: which occasionally throbbed ; it was merely another part---part%1:24:00:: of his weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: .
Rachel---person%1:03:00:: mentioned Kate---person%1:03:00:: .
She said , `` I notice the girl---girl%1:18:02:: from across the street---street%1:06:00:: has n't bothered to phone or visit '' .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: said , `` That 's all right .
Kate---person%1:03:00:: 's all right '' .
He thought about it briefly , then deliberately turned the talk---talk%1:10:00:: to something else .
Once , sitting at the front window---window%1:06:00:: in his parents---parent%1:18:00:: ' room---room%1:06:00:: , he saw Kate---person%1:03:00:: come out of her house---house%1:06:00:: .
She was with Elizabeth---person%1:03:00:: .
The heavy branches---branch%1:20:00:: in his front yard---front_yard%1:06:00:: would hide and then reveal them .
They turned at the bottom---bottom%1:15:01:: of Kate---person%1:03:00:: 's steps---steps%1:06:00:: and moved off in the direction---direction%1:15:00:: of the park---park%1:15:00:: .
He thought he saw - it awakened and , for a moment---moment%1:28:01:: , interested him - that Elizabeth---person%1:03:00:: held a leash---leash%1:06:00:: in her hand---hand%1:08:00:: and that a round fuzzy puppy---puppy%1:05:00:: was on the end---end%1:15:00:: of the leash---leash%1:06:00:: .
Then they disappeared and Scotty---person%1:03:00:: got up and went into his own room---room%1:06:00:: and got into bed .
By the time---time%1:11:00:: he was under the covers---cover%1:06:01:: he had forgotten about seeing Kate---person%1:03:00:: .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: , since Scotty---person%1:03:00:: was no longer allowed to make his regular trips---trip%1:04:00:: into town---town%1:15:00:: to see him , came often and informally to the house---house%1:06:00:: .
He would sit , slim-waisted and spare , on the edge---edge%1:06:00:: of Scotty---person%1:03:00:: 's bed---bed%1:06:00:: , his legs---leg%1:08:01:: crossed so elaborately that the crossed foot---foot%1:08:01:: could tap the floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: did not mind the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: 's unsmiling teasing---teasing%1:04:00:: as he used to .
`` Husky young man---young_man%1:18:00:: '' , he said with mock distaste---distaste%1:12:00:: .
`` I imagine you 're always battling in school---school%1:14:00:: '' .
`` I do n't go to school---school%1:14:00:: any more '' .
The doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: had to bend close to hear ; his delicate hand---hand%1:08:00:: , as veined as a moth---moth%1:05:00:: 's wing---wing%1:05:00:: , rested absently on Scotty---person%1:03:00:: 's chest---chest%1:08:00:: .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: said the same words---word%1:10:03:: more loudly .
Well , we 're taking a little vacation---vacation%1:28:00:: , that 's all '' .
He turned unsmilingly to Rachel---person%1:03:00:: .
`` I think by the end---end%1:28:00:: of next week---week%1:28:00:: he could get out in the air---air%1:15:01:: a little .
He could now but the weakness---weakness%1:26:00:: is very definite ; it would exhaust him further and unnecessarily .
His stethoscope---stethoscope%1:06:00:: was on the table---table%1:06:01:: by Scotty---person%1:03:00:: 's bed---bed%1:06:00:: and he picked it up and wagged it at Scotty---person%1:03:00:: .
He said fussily , `` Just keep the cap---cap%1:06:02:: on those strong emotions---emotion%1:12:00:: '' .
The stethoscope---stethoscope%1:06:00:: glinted silver in the darkening room---room%1:06:00:: .
`` I 'll drop by again in a few days---day%1:28:00:: '' .
Rachel---person%1:03:00:: stayed on after the doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: had gone .
She smoothed the covers---cover%1:06:01:: on Scotty---person%1:03:00:: 's bed---bed%1:06:00:: and picked things---thing%1:06:00:: up from the floor---floor%1:06:00:: .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: watched with disinterest---disinterest%1:09:01:: .
He had no desire---desire%1:12:00:: to .
She said , `` Do you think you 'll miss school---school%1:14:00:: '' ?
He had noticed how formal and irritably exact Rachel---person%1:03:00:: had grown .
He felt her irritability---irritability%1:12:00:: did not concern him , yet he knew he would not care even if it did .
He shook his head---head%1:08:00:: .
`` We 've had any number---number%1:23:00:: of calls---call%1:10:01:: about you .
You could win a popularity contest---popularity_contest%1:04:00:: at that school---school%1:14:00:: without any trouble---trouble%1:04:02:: .
Miss Estherson---person%1:03:00:: called twice .
She wants to pay you a visit---visit%1:14:00:: .
She says the children---child%1:18:00:: miss you .
Apparently you were the light---light%1:18:00:: of their lives---life%1:09:00:: '' .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: shrugged slightly .
Rachel---person%1:03:00:: came close to the bed---bed%1:06:00:: , bent as if she would kiss him , then moved away .
`` That doctor---doctor%1:18:00:: annoys me '' .
`` Do you suppose his self-consciousness---self-consciousness%1:12:00:: is characteristic of the new Negro professionals---professional%1:18:00:: or merely of doctors---doctor%1:18:00:: in general '' ?
`` Well , Mrs. Charles ----person%1:03:00:: Sally---sally%1:10:00:: - has phoned too .
Rachel---person%1:03:00:: 's tone---tone%1:10:01:: was dry .
`` She did n't really say '' - She glanced away at the floor---floor%1:06:00:: , then swooped gracefully and picked up one---one%1:23:00:: of Scotty---person%1:03:00:: 's slippers---slipper%1:06:00:: .
`` I mean , do you feel like seeing Kate---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: said , `` I do n't know '' .
There was the slight pain---pain%1:26:00:: , but it was no different from the throbbing---throbbing%1:11:00:: in his head---head%1:08:00:: .
`` Well , there 's time---time%1:28:06:: , in any case .
She put the slipper---slipper%1:06:00:: neatly by its mate---mate%1:06:00:: at the foot---foot%1:15:00:: of the bed---bed%1:06:00:: .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: said , `` Okay '' .
This time---time%1:11:00:: Rachel---person%1:03:00:: kissed him lightly on the forehead---forehead%1:08:00:: .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: was pleased .
His father---father%1:18:00:: was a constant visitor---visitor%1:18:00:: .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: would hear the front door---front_door%1:06:00:: in the evening---evening%1:28:00:: and then his father---father%1:18:00:: 's deep slow voice---voice%1:07:00:: ; it floated up the stairs---stairs%1:06:00:: .
`` How 's Scotty---person%1:03:00:: '' ?
And Rachel---person%1:03:00:: 's or Virginia---person%1:03:00:: 's reply---reply%1:10:01:: : `` Better .
He 's getting plenty---plenty%1:07:00:: of rest---rest%1:04:00:: '' .
`` Is his appetite---appetite%1:12:00:: improved '' ?
Or : `` Does he get exercise---exercise%1:04:00:: '' ?
The exchange---exchange%1:10:00:: was almost invariable , and Scotty---person%1:03:00:: , in his bed---bed%1:06:00:: , could hear every word---word%1:10:00:: of it .
It required an energy---energy%1:07:02:: he no longer possessed to be satirical about his father---father%1:18:00:: .
His father---father%1:18:00:: would come upstairs and stand self-consciously at the foot---foot%1:15:00:: of the bed---bed%1:06:00:: and look at his son---son%1:18:00:: .
After a pause---pause%1:28:00:: , during which he studied Scotty---person%1:03:00:: 's face---face%1:08:00:: as if Scotty---person%1:03:00:: were not there and could not study him too , Mr. McKinley---person%1:03:00:: would ask the same questions---question%1:10:00:: he had asked downstairs .
Scotty---person%1:03:00:: would reply---reply%1:10:01:: softly and his father---father%1:18:00:: , apologetically , would ask him to repeat .
`` I'm eating---eating%1:04:00:: more '' , he would say .
Or : `` I walk around the house---house%1:06:00:: a lot '' .
He did not mind the useless , kindly questions---question%1:10:00:: .
He looked at the lined face---face%1:08:00:: with vague interest---interest%1:09:00:: ; he felt he was noting it , as if it were something he might think about when he grew stronger .
Mr. McKinley---person%1:03:00:: examined everything with critical care---care%1:04:01:: , seeking something material to blame for his son---son%1:18:00:: 's illness---illness%1:26:00:: .
`` Have you got enough blankets---blanket%1:06:00:: '' ?
And another time---time%1:11:00:: , without accusation---accusation%1:10:00:: : `` You never wore that scarf---scarf%1:06:00:: I bought you '' .
As a result---result%1:11:00:: , although we still make use---use%1:04:00:: of this distinction---distinction%1:09:00:: , there is much confusion---confusion%1:09:00:: as to the meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: of the basic terms---term%1:10:00:: employed .
Just what is meant by `` spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: '' and by `` matter---matter%1:09:01:: '' ?
The terms---term%1:10:00:: are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements---element%1:09:00:: in the common experience---experience%1:09:01:: of all .
Yet in the contemporary context---context%1:10:00:: this is precisely what one must not do .
For in the modern world---modern_world%1:28:00:: neither `` spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: '' nor `` matter---matter%1:03:00:: '' refer to any generally agreed-upon elements---element%1:09:00:: of experience---experience%1:09:01:: .
We are in a transitional stage---stage%1:28:00:: in which many of the connotations---connotation%1:10:00:: of former usage---usage%1:04:00:: have had to be revised or rejected .
When the words---word%1:10:00:: are used , we are never sure which of the traditional meanings---meaning%1:09:00:: the user---user%1:18:00:: may have in mind , or to what extent his revisions---revision%1:04:00:: and rejections---rejection%1:04:00:: of former understandings---understanding%1:09:01:: correspond to ours .
One of the most widespread features---feature%1:09:00:: of contemporary thought---thought%1:09:01:: is the almost universal disbelief---disbelief%1:09:00:: in the reality---reality%1:09:00:: of spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: .
Just a few centuries---century%1:28:00:: ago the world---world%1:14:01:: of spirits---spirit%1:18:00:: was as populous and real as the world---world%1:14:01:: of material entities---entity%1:03:00:: .
Not only in popular thought---thought%1:09:01:: but in that of the highly educated as well was this true .
Demons---demon%1:18:00:: , fairies---fairy%1:18:00:: , angels---angel%1:18:00:: , and a host---host%1:14:00:: of other spiritual beings---spiritual_being%1:18:00:: were as much a part---part%1:24:00:: of the experiential world---world%1:09:00:: of western man as were rocks---rock%1:17:01:: and trees---tree%1:20:00:: and stars---star%1:17:00:: .
In such a world the words `` matter '' and `` spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: '' both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all .
In such a world---world%1:09:00:: the words---word%1:10:00:: `` matter---matter%1:03:00:: '' and `` spirit---spirit%1:18:00:: '' both referred to directly known realities---reality%1:09:00:: in the common experience---experience%1:09:01:: of all .
In it important elements---element%1:09:00:: of Christianity---christianity%1:09:00:: and of the Biblical view---view%1:09:02:: of reality---reality%1:09:00:: in general , which now cause us much difficulty---difficulty%1:04:00:: , could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously .
The progress---progress%1:04:01:: of science over these last few centuries---century%1:28:00:: and the gradual replacement---replacement%1:04:00:: of Biblical by scientific categories---category%1:09:02:: of reality---reality%1:09:00:: have to a large extent---extent%1:07:00:: emptied the spirit world of the entities---entity%1:03:00:: which previously populated it .
In carrying out this program---program%1:09:00:: science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service---service%1:04:08:: for which it can claim due credit---credit%1:10:00:: .
The objectification---objectification%1:04:00:: of the world---world%1:14:01:: of spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: in popular superstition---superstition%1:09:00:: had certainly gone far beyond what the experience---experience%1:09:01:: of spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: could justify or support .
Science is fully competent to deal with any element---element%1:09:00:: of experience---experience%1:09:01:: which arises from an object---object%1:03:00:: in space---space%1:03:00:: and time---time%1:28:04:: .
When , therefore , it turned its attention---attention%1:09:00:: to the concrete entities---entity%1:03:00:: with which popular imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: had peopled the world---world%1:14:01:: of spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: , these entities---entity%1:03:00:: soon lost whatever status---status%1:26:00:: they had enjoyed as actual elements---element%1:09:00:: of external reality---reality%1:09:00:: .
In doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions---misconception%1:09:00:: , removed extraneous and illusory sources---source%1:15:00:: of fear---fear%1:12:00:: , and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions---superstition%1:09:00:: .
There have been , indeed , many important and valuable gains---gain%1:07:02:: from the development---development%1:22:02:: of our present scientific view---view%1:09:02:: of the world---world%1:17:01:: for which we may be rightly grateful .
All this has not , however , been an unmixed blessing---blessing%1:04:01:: .
The scientific debunking---debunking%1:04:00:: of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough .
The house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means---means%1:04:00:: , or at best with wholly inadequate means---means%1:04:00:: , for dealing with his experience---experience%1:09:01:: of spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: .
Although the particular form---form%1:09:00:: of conceptualization---conceptualization%1:04:00:: which popular imagination---imagination%1:09:01:: had made in response---response%1:19:00:: to the experience---experience%1:09:01:: of spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: was undoubtedly defective , the raw experience---experience%1:09:00:: itself which led to such excesses---excess%1:07:00:: remains with us as vividly as ever .
We simply find ourselves in the position---position%1:04:00:: of having no means---means%1:04:00:: for inquiring into the structure---structure%1:09:00:: and meaning---meaning%1:09:00:: of this range---range%1:07:00:: of our experience---experience%1:09:01:: .
There is no framework---framework%1:09:00:: or structure---structure%1:09:00:: of thought---thought%1:09:00:: with respect to which we can organize it and no part---part%1:24:00:: of reality---reality%1:09:00:: , as we know and apprehend it , with respect to which we can refer this experience---experience%1:09:00:: .
Science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector---sector%1:09:00:: of our lives---life%1:26:02:: .
The situation---situation%1:26:00:: in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force---force%1:07:00:: in Arthur Miller---person%1:03:00:: 's play---play%1:10:01:: The Crucible , which deals with the Salem---location%1:03:00:: witch---witch%1:18:01:: trials .
As the play---play%1:10:01:: opens the audience---audience%1:14:00:: is introduced to the community---community%1:14:00:: of Salem---location%1:03:00:: in Puritan America---america%1:15:00:: at the end---end%1:28:00:: of the eighteenth century---century%1:28:00:: .
Aside from a quaint concern---concern%1:12:01:: with witches---witch%1:18:00:: and devils---devil%1:18:00:: which provides the immediate problem---problem%1:10:00:: in the opening scene---scene%1:10:00:: , it is a quite normal community---community%1:14:00:: .
The conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: of the characters---character%1:09:01:: creates an atmosphere---atmosphere%1:26:01:: suggesting the usual mixture---mixture%1:14:00:: of pleasures---pleasure%1:12:00:: , foibles---foible%1:07:00:: , irritations---irritation%1:26:00:: , and concerns---concern%1:12:01:: which would characterize the common life---life%1:26:01:: of a normal village---village%1:14:00:: in any age---age%1:28:02:: .
There is no occasion---occasion%1:16:00:: to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people---people%1:14:00:: .
Instead , the audience---audience%1:14:00:: can sit back at ease and , from the perspective---perspective%1:09:00:: of an enlightened time---time%1:28:00:: which no longer believes in such things---thing%1:09:00:: , enjoy the dead seriousness---seriousness%1:12:00:: with which the characters---character%1:09:01:: in the play---play%1:10:01:: take the witches---witch%1:18:00:: and devils---devil%1:18:00:: which are under discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: .
A teenage girl---girl%1:18:02:: , Abigail Williams---person%1:03:00:: , is being sharply questioned by her minister---minister%1:18:00:: uncle---uncle%1:18:00:: , the Reverend Samuel Parris---person%1:03:00:: , about a wild night---night%1:28:00:: affair---affair%1:11:00:: in the woods---woods%1:14:00:: in which she and some other girls---girl%1:18:02:: had seemed to have had contact---contact%1:04:02:: with these evil beings---being%1:03:00:: .
For all involved in this discussion---discussion%1:10:00:: the devil---devil%1:18:02:: is a real entity---entity%1:03:00:: who can really be confronted in the woods---woods%1:14:00:: on a dark night---night%1:28:00:: , the demon---demon%1:18:00:: world---world%1:14:01:: is populated with real creatures---creature%1:03:00:: , and witches---witch%1:18:00:: actually can be seen flying through the air---air%1:15:00:: .
As the play---play%1:10:01:: unfolds , however , the audience---audience%1:14:00:: is subtly brought into the grip---grip%1:04:00:: of an awful evil---evil%1:04:00:: which grows with ominously gathering power---power%1:07:00:: and soon engulfs the community---community%1:14:00:: .
Everyone in Salem---location%1:03:00:: , saint---saint%1:18:00:: and sinner---sinner%1:18:00:: alike , is swept up by it .
It is like a mysterious epidemic---epidemic%1:11:00:: which , starting first with Abigail---person%1:03:00:: and Parris---person%1:03:00:: , spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence---virulence%1:07:00:: through the whole town---town%1:14:00:: until all have been infected by it .
It grows terribly and unavoidably in power---power%1:07:00:: and leaves in its wake---wake%1:19:00:: a trail---trail%1:17:01:: of misery---misery%1:26:00:: , moral disintegration---disintegration%1:26:00:: , and destruction---destruction%1:11:00:: .
The audience---audience%1:14:00:: leaves the play---play%1:10:03:: under a spell---spell%1:26:00:: , It is the kind---kind%1:09:00:: of spell---spell%1:26:00:: which the exposure---exposure%1:04:06:: to spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: in its living active manifestation---manifestation%1:11:00:: always evokes .
If one asks about this play---play%1:10:01:: , what it is that comes upon this community---community%1:14:00:: and works within it with such terrible power---power%1:07:00:: , there is no better answer---answer%1:10:01:: to give than `` spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: '' .
This is not to attempt to say what spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: is , but only to employ a commonly used word---word%1:10:00:: to designate or simply identify a common experience---experience%1:09:01:: .
In the end the good man---man%1:18:00:: , John Proctor---person%1:03:00:: , expresses what the audience---audience%1:14:00:: has already come to feel when he says , `` A fire---fire%1:27:01:: , a fire---fire%1:27:01:: is burning !
I hear the boot---boot%1:06:00:: of Lucifer---lucifer%1:18:00:: , I see his filthy face---face%1:07:00:: '' !
The tragic irony---irony%1:10:01:: of the play---play%1:10:01:: is that the very belief in and concern---concern%1:12:01:: with a devil---devil%1:18:02:: who could be met in the woods---woods%1:14:00:: and combatted with formulae---formula%1:10:02:: set out in books---book%1:10:00:: was the very thing---thing%1:09:00:: that prevented them from detecting the real devil---devil%1:18:02:: when he came among them .
We marvel at their blindness---blindness%1:26:00:: for not seeing this .
Yet are not we of the mid twentieth century---century%1:28:00:: , who rightly do not believe there is any such `` thing---thing%1:06:01:: '' as the devil---devil%1:18:02:: , just as bad off as they - only in a different way---way%1:06:00:: ?
In our disbelief---disbelief%1:09:00:: we think that we can no longer even use the word---word%1:10:00:: and so are unable to even name the elemental power---power%1:07:00:: which is so vividly real in this play---play%1:10:01:: .
We are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear---fear%1:12:01:: that to do so would imply a commitment---commitment%1:07:01:: to that which has already been discredited and proved false .
Even Mr. Miller---person%1:03:00:: himself seems uncertain on this score---score%1:09:01:: .
In a long commentary---commentary%1:10:00:: which he has inserted in the published text---text%1:10:00:: of the first act---act%1:10:00:: of the play---play%1:10:01:: , he says at one point---point%1:15:00:: : `` However , that experience---experience%1:09:01:: never raised a doubt---doubt%1:09:00:: in his mind---mind%1:09:00:: as to the reality---reality%1:26:01:: of the underworld or the existence---existence%1:26:00:: of Lucifer---lucifer%1:18:00:: 's many faced lieutenants---lieutenant%1:18:02:: .
And his belief---belief%1:09:00:: is not to his discredit---discredit%1:26:00:: .
Better minds---mind%1:09:00:: than Hale---person%1:03:00:: 's were - and still are - convinced that there is a society---society%1:14:01:: of spirits---spirit%1:18:00:: beyond our ken---ken%1:09:00:: '' .
Better minds than Hale 's were - and still are - convinced that there is a society of spirits---spirit%1:18:01:: beyond our ken '' .
( page---page%1:10:00:: 33 ) On the other hand , a little later on he says :
`` Since 1692 a great but superficial change---change%1:11:00:: has wiped out God 's beard and the Devil 's horns , but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes .
`` Since 1692 a great but superficial change---change%1:04:00:: has wiped out God---god%1:18:00:: 's beard---beard%1:08:00:: and the Devil---devil%1:18:02:: 's horns---horn%1:05:01:: , but the world---world%1:14:01:: is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes---absolute%1:09:00:: .
The concept---concept%1:09:00:: of unity---unity%1:26:00:: , in which positive and negative are attributes---attribute%1:09:00:: of the same force---force%1:07:00:: , in which good---good%1:07:01:: and evil---evil%1:04:00:: are relative , ever-changing , and always joined to the same phenomenon---phenomenon%1:03:00:: - such a concept---concept%1:09:00:: is still reserved to the physical sciences---physical_science%1:09:00:: and to the few who have grasped the history---history%1:28:00:: of ideas---idea%1:09:00:: .
When we see the steady and methodical inculcation---inculcation%1:04:00:: into humanity of the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of man 's worthlessness---worthlessness%1:07:00:: - until redeemed - the necessity---necessity%1:26:00:: of the Devil---devil%1:18:02:: may become evident as a weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: , a weapon---weapon%1:06:00:: designed and used time and time again in every age---age%1:28:02:: to whip men into a surrender---surrender%1:10:00:: to a particular church---church%1:14:00:: or church-state---church-state%1:14:00:: '' .
Apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play---play%1:10:01:: should think of the devil---devil%1:18:02:: as being actually real .
Yet such is the dramatic power---power%1:07:00:: of his writing---writing%1:10:00:: that the audience---audience%1:14:00:: is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power---power%1:07:00:: and potency---potency%1:07:01:: of that which came over Salem---location%1:03:00:: .
It casts a spell---spell%1:26:00:: upon them so that they leave with a feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: of having been in the mysterious presence---presence%1:18:00:: of an evil power---power%1:18:00:: .
It is not enough in accounting for this feeling---feeling%1:09:03:: to analyze it into the wickedness---wickedness%1:04:00:: of individual people---people%1:14:00:: added together to produce a cumulative effect---effect%1:19:00:: .
For this does not account for the integral , elemental power---power%1:07:00:: of that which grows with abounding vigor---vigor%1:07:02:: as the play---play%1:10:01:: unfolds , nor does it explain the strange numinous sense---sense%1:09:05:: of presentness---presentness%1:07:00:: which comes over those who watch the play---play%1:10:03:: like a spell---spell%1:26:00:: .
The reality---reality%1:26:01:: of spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: emerges in this play---play%1:10:01:: in spite of the author---author%1:18:00:: 's convictions---conviction%1:09:00:: to the contrary .
There is nothing---nothing%1:23:00:: in the whole range---range%1:07:00:: of human experience---experience%1:09:01:: more widely known and universally felt than spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: .
Apart from spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: there could be no community---community%1:14:00:: , for it is spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: which draws men into community---community%1:14:00:: and gives to any community---community%1:14:00:: its unity---unity%1:26:00:: , cohesiveness---cohesiveness%1:26:00:: , and permanence---permanence%1:07:00:: .
Think , for example , of the spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: of the Marine Corps .
Think , for example , of the spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: of the Marine Corps---marine_corps%1:14:00:: .
Surely this is a reality---reality%1:09:00:: we all acknowledge .
We cannot , of course , assign it any substance---substance%1:03:00:: .
It is not material and is not a `` thing---thing%1:06:01:: '' occupying space---space%1:03:00:: and time---time%1:03:00:: .
Yet it exists and has an objective reality---reality%1:09:00:: which can be experienced and known .
So it is too with many other spirits---spirit%1:18:01:: which we all know : the spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: of Nazism---nazism%1:14:00:: or Communism---communism%1:09:00:: , school---school%1:14:02:: spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: , the spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: of a street corner---street_corner%1:06:00:: gang---gang%1:14:02:: or a football team---football_team%1:14:00:: , the spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: of Rotary---group%1:03:00:: or the Ku Klux Klan---ku_klux_klan%1:14:00:: .

Every community , if it is alive has a spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: , and that spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: is the center of its unity and identity .

In searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: , the close connection between spirit---spirit%1:26:00:: and community is likely to prove the most fruitful .

Yet the spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: which lives in community---community%1:14:00:: is not identical with the community---community%1:14:00:: .
The idea---idea%1:09:00:: of community---community%1:14:00:: and the idea---idea%1:09:00:: of spirit---spirit%1:18:01:: are two distinct and separable ideas---idea%1:09:00:: .

Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh---person%1:03:00:: said he had n't decided between Mizell---person%1:03:00:: and Vern Law---person%1:03:00:: for Wednesday---wednesday%1:28:00:: 's game---game%1:04:00:: .
Mizell---person%1:03:00:: has won both of his starts---start%1:04:02:: .
After a lengthy workout---workout%1:04:00:: yesterday---yesterday%1:28:01:: , an open date---date%1:28:00:: , Hemus---person%1:03:00:: said that Bob Nieman---person%1:03:00:: definitely would stay in the lineup---lineup%1:10:00:: .
That means Stan Musial---person%1:03:00:: probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary---anniversary%1:28:00:: of his record five home run---home_run%1:04:00:: day---day%1:28:01:: against the Giants---group%1:03:00:: .
`` I have to stay with Nieman---person%1:03:00:: for a while '' , Hemus---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Bill White---person%1:03:00:: ( sore ankles---ankle%1:08:00:: ) should be ready .
With a lefthander---left-hander%1:18:00:: going for Pittsburgh---group%1:03:00:: , I may use Don Taussig---person%1:03:00:: in center---center%1:06:02:: '' .
`` Lindy McDaniel---person%1:03:00:: threw batting practice---practice%1:04:02:: about 25 minutes---minute%1:28:00:: , and he looked good '' , Hemus---person%1:03:00:: said .
Our pitching---pitching%1:04:00:: is much better than it has shown '' .
The statistics---statistic%1:09:00:: hardly indicated that the Pirates---group%1:03:00:: needed extra batting practice---practice%1:04:02:: , but Murtaugh---person%1:03:00:: also turned his men---men%1:14:00:: loose at Busch Stadium---location%1:03:00:: yesterday---yesterday%1:28:01:: .
Until the Bucs---group%1:03:00:: ' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati---cincinnati%1:15:00:: over the weekend---weekend%1:28:00:: , the champions---champion%1:18:01:: had eight men---man%1:18:00:: hitting over .300 .
Despite the recession---recession%1:26:00:: , Pittsburgh---group%1:03:00:: came into town---town%1:15:00:: with this imposing list---list%1:10:00:: of averages---average%1:09:00:: : Smoky Burgess---person%1:03:00:: .455 , Gino Cimoli---person%1:03:00:: .389 , Bill Virdon---person%1:03:00:: .340 , Bob Clemente---person%1:03:00:: and Dick Groat---person%1:03:00:: , each .323 , Dick Stuart---person%1:03:00:: .306 , Don Hoak---person%1:03:00:: .280 and Bob Skinner---person%1:03:00:: .267 .
Bill Mazeroski---person%1:03:00:: with .179 and Hal Smith---person%1:03:00:: with .143 were the only Pirates---group%1:03:00:: dragging their feet .
Perhaps the Pirate---group%1:03:00:: who will be the unhappiest over the news---news%1:10:01:: that Musial---person%1:03:00:: probably will sit out most of the series---series%1:14:00:: is Bob Friend---person%1:03:00:: , who was beaten by The Man---person%1:03:00:: twice last season---season%1:28:02:: on dramatic home runs---home_run%1:04:00:: .
Friend---person%1:03:00:: is off to a great start---start%1:11:00:: with a 4 - 0 record---record%1:23:00:: but is n't likely to see action---action%1:04:03:: here this week---week%1:28:00:: .
`` We 're getting Friend---person%1:03:00:: some runs---run%1:04:01:: for a change---change%1:24:00:: , and he has been pitching good '' , Murtaugh---person%1:03:00:: said .
`` Virdon---person%1:03:00:: has been blasting the ball---ball%1:06:01:: .
No plunkers---plunker%1:04:00:: for him '' .
The Pirates---group%1:03:00:: jumped off to an 11 - 3 start---start%1:11:00:: by May---may%1:28:00:: 1 last year---year%1:28:01:: , when the Redbirds---group%1:03:00:: as well as the Dodgers---group%1:03:00:: held them even over the season---season%1:28:02:: .
On last May---may%1:28:00:: 1 , the Cardinals---group%1:03:00:: stood at 7 - 6 , ending a two season---season%1:28:02:: fall-off---falloff%1:22:00:: on that milestone---milestone%1:10:01:: .
In 1958 , the Birds---group%1:03:00:: were 3 - 10 on May---may%1:28:00:: 1 .
A year---year%1:28:01:: later they were 4 - 13 .
Since 1949 , the St. Louis---st._louis%1:15:00:: club---club%1:14:01:: has been below .500 on May---may%1:28:00:: 1 just four times---time%1:11:00:: .
The '49 team---team%1:14:00:: was off to a so-so 5 - 5 beginning---beginning%1:11:00:: , then fell as low as 12 - 17 on May---may%1:28:00:: 23 before finishing with 96 victories---victory%1:11:00:: .
The '52 Cards---group%1:03:00:: were 6 - 7 on May---may%1:28:00:: 1 but ended with 88 triumphs---triumph%1:11:00:: , the club---club%1:14:01:: 's top---top%1:26:00:: since 1949 .
Then last season---season%1:28:02:: the Birds---group%1:03:00:: tumbled as low as 11 - 18 on May---may%1:28:00:: 19 before recovering to make a race---race%1:11:01:: of it and total 86 victories---victory%1:11:00:: .
Since 1949 , the only National League---group%1:03:00:: club---club%1:14:01:: that got off to a hot start---start%1:11:00:: and made a runaway---runaway%1:11:00:: of the race---race%1:11:01:: was the '55 Dodger---group%1:03:00:: team---team%1:14:00:: .
Those Dodgers---group%1:03:00:: won their first 10 games---game%1:04:00:: and owned a 21 - 2 mark---mark%1:09:01:: and a nine game---game%1:04:03:: lead---lead%1:07:02:: by May---may%1:28:00:: 8 .
The club---club%1:14:01:: that overcame the worst start---start%1:11:00:: in a comparable period---period%1:28:00:: to win the pennant---pennant%1:10:01:: was New York---new_york%1:15:01:: 's '51 Giants---group%1:03:00:: , who dropped 11 of their first 13 .
They honored the battling Billikens---group%1:03:00:: last night---night%1:28:00:: .
Speakers---speaker%1:18:00:: at a Tipoff Club---group%1:03:00:: dinner---dinner%1:14:00:: dealt lavish praise---praise%1:10:00:: to a group---group%1:03:00:: of St. Louis University---group%1:03:00:: players---player%1:18:01:: who , in the words---word%1:10:03:: of Coach John Benington---person%1:03:00:: , `` had more confidence---confidence%1:09:00:: in themselves than I did '' .
The most valuable player---most_valuable_player%1:18:00:: award---award%1:21:00:: was split three ways , among Glen Mankowski---person%1:03:00:: , Gordon Hartweger---person%1:03:00:: and Tom Kieffer---person%1:03:00:: .
In addition , a special award---award%1:21:00:: was given to Bob ( Bevo )---person%1:03:00:: Nordmann---person%1:03:00:: , the 6 - foot---foot%1:23:00:: - 10 center---center%1:18:01:: who missed much of the season---season%1:28:02:: because of a knee---knee%1:08:00:: injury---injury%1:26:00:: .
`` You often hear people---people%1:14:00:: talk about team spirit---team_spirit%1:07:00:: and that sort---sort%1:09:00:: of thing---thing%1:10:00:: '' , Benington---person%1:03:00:: said in a conversation---conversation%1:10:00:: after the ceremonies---ceremony%1:11:00:: , `` but what this team---team%1:14:00:: had was a little different .
The boys---boy%1:18:00:: had a tremendous respect---respect%1:26:00:: for each other 's ability---ability%1:09:00:: .
`` Several times---time%1:11:00:: I found the players---player%1:18:01:: pepping me up , where it usually is the coach---coach%1:18:01:: who is supposed to deliver the fight---fight%1:07:00:: talk---talk%1:04:02:: .
We 'd be losing at halftime---halftime%1:28:00:: to a good team---team%1:14:00:: and Hartweger---person%1:03:00:: would say , ' Do n't worry , Coach---coach%1:18:01:: - we 'll get 'em all right '' ' .
The trio---trio%1:23:00:: who shared the most-valuable honors---honor%1:10:00:: were introduced by Bob Broeg---person%1:03:00:: , sports editor---sports_editor%1:18:00:: of the Post-Dispatch .
Kieffer---person%1:03:00:: , the only junior---junior%1:18:01:: in the group---group%1:03:00:: , was commended for his ability---ability%1:09:00:: to hit in the clutch---clutch%1:26:00:: , as well as his all-round excellent play---play%1:04:04:: .
Mankowski---person%1:03:00:: , the ball-hawking defensive expert---expert%1:18:00:: , was cited for his performance---performance%1:04:00:: against Bradley---group%1:03:00:: in St. Louis U.---group%1:03:00:: 's nationally televised victory---victory%1:11:00:: .
Benington---person%1:03:00:: said , `` I 've never seen a player---player%1:18:01:: have a game---game%1:04:00:: as great as Mankowski---person%1:03:00:: did against Bradley---group%1:03:00:: that day---day%1:28:01:: '' .
Benington---person%1:03:00:: recalled that he once told Hartweger---person%1:03:00:: that he doubted Gordon---person%1:03:00:: would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball---basketball%1:04:00:: skills---skill%1:09:00:: .
After the coach---coach%1:18:01:: listed all the boy---boy%1:18:00:: 's faults---fault%1:26:00:: , Hartweger---person%1:03:00:: said , `` Coach---coach%1:18:01:: before I leave here , you 'll get to like me '' .
Mrs. Benington---person%1:03:00:: admired Gordon---person%1:03:00:: 's spirit---spirit%1:07:00:: and did what she could to persuade her husband---husband%1:18:00:: that the boy---boy%1:18:00:: might help the team---team%1:14:00:: .
As Hartweger---person%1:03:00:: accepted his silver---silver%1:21:00:: bowl---bowl%1:25:00:: , he said , `` I want to thank coach---coach%1:18:01:: 's wife---wife%1:18:00:: for talking him into letting me play '' .
Bob Burnes---person%1:03:00:: , sports editor---sports_editor%1:18:00:: of the Globe-Democrat , presented Bob Nordmann---person%1:03:00:: with his award---award%1:10:00:: .
Bevo---person%1:03:00:: was congratulated for his efforts---effort%1:04:00:: to stay in shape---shape%1:08:00:: so that he could help the team---team%1:14:00:: if his knee---knee%1:08:00:: healed in time .
Within a week---week%1:28:00:: after the injury---injury%1:26:00:: , suffered in St. Louis---st._louis%1:15:00:: 's victory---victory%1:11:00:: in the final game---game%1:04:00:: of the Kentucky---kentucky%1:15:00:: tournament---tournament%1:11:00:: , Nordmann---person%1:03:00:: was sitting on the Bill---group%1:03:00:: 's bench doing what he could to help Benington---person%1:03:00:: .
On the clock---clock%1:06:00:: given him was the inscription---inscription%1:10:00:: , `` For Outstanding Contribution---contribution%1:21:00:: to Billiken Basketball---group%1:03:00:: , 1960 - 61 '' .
Other lettermen---letterman%1:18:00:: from the team---team%1:14:00:: that compiled a 21 - 9 record---record%1:23:00:: and finished as runner-up---runner-up%1:18:00:: in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric---person%1:03:00:: , Donnell Reid---person%1:03:00:: , Bill Nordmann---person%1:03:00:: , Dave Harris---person%1:03:00:: , Dave Luechtefeld---person%1:03:00:: and George Latinovich---person%1:03:00:: .
`` This team---team%1:14:00:: set a precedent---precedent%1:09:00:: that could be valuable in the future---future%1:28:00:: '' , Benington---person%1:03:00:: pointed out .
`` By winning against Bradley---group%1:03:00:: , Kentucky---group%1:03:00:: and Notre Dame---group%1:03:00:: on those teams---team%1:14:00:: ' home courts---court%1:06:01:: , they showed that the home court---court%1:06:01:: advantage---advantage%1:07:00:: can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn 's take a super team---team%1:14:00:: to do it '' .
St. Louis University---group%1:03:00:: found a way---way%1:04:01:: to win a baseball game---baseball_game%1:04:00:: .
Larry Scherer---person%1:03:00:: last night---night%1:28:00:: pitched a no-hit game---no-hit_game%1:04:00:: , said to be the first---first%1:24:00:: in Billiken---group%1:03:00:: baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: history---history%1:28:00:: , as the Blue and White---group%1:03:00:: beat Southeast Missouri State College---group%1:03:00:: , 5 - 1 , at Crystal City---location%1:03:00:: .
The victory---victory%1:11:00:: was the first---first%1:24:00:: of the season---season%1:28:02:: for the Billikens---group%1:03:00:: after nine defeats---defeat%1:11:00:: and a tie---tie%1:26:00:: .
The tie---tie%1:26:00:: was against Southeast Missouri---group%1:03:00:: last Friday---friday%1:28:00:: .
Scherer---person%1:03:00:: also had a big night---night%1:28:00:: at bat---bat%1:04:00:: with four hits---hit%1:04:03:: in five trips---trip%1:04:00:: including a double---double%1:04:00:: , Len Boehmer---person%1:03:00:: also was 4 - for - 5 with two doubles---double%1:04:00:: and Dave Ritchie---person%1:03:00:: had a home run---home_run%1:04:00:: and a triple---triple%1:04:00:: .
St. Louis U.---group%1:03:00:: was to be in action---action%1:04:03:: again today---today%1:28:00:: with a game---game%1:04:00:: scheduled at 4 against Washington University---group%1:03:00:: at Ligget Field---location%1:03:00:: .
The game---game%1:04:00:: opened a busy week---week%1:28:00:: for Washington---group%1:03:00:: .
The Bears---group%1:03:00:: are set to play at Harris Teachers College---group%1:03:00:: at 3:30 tomorrow---tomorrow%1:28:00:: and have a doubleheader---doubleheader%1:04:00:: at Quincy---location%1:03:00:: , Ill.---location%1:03:00:: , Saturday---saturday%1:28:00:: .
If it 's true that contented cows---cow%1:05:02:: give more milk---milk%1:13:01:: , why should n't happy ball---ball%1:06:01:: players---player%1:18:01:: produce more base hits---base_hit%1:04:00:: ?
The two top talents---talent%1:18:00:: of the time---time%1:28:00:: , Mickey Mantle---person%1:03:00:: and Willie Mays---person%1:03:00:: , have hit the ball---ball%1:06:01:: harder and more successfully so far this early season---season%1:28:02:: than at any period---period%1:28:00:: in careers---career%1:04:00:: which , to be frank about it , never have quite reached expectations---expectation%1:26:00:: .
And that 's meant as a boost---boost%1:04:00:: , not a knock---knock%1:09:00:: .
Mays---person%1:03:00:: and Mantle---person%1:03:00:: , both 10 - year---year%1:28:01:: men---man%1:18:00:: at 30 , have so much ability---ability%1:09:00:: that , baseball---baseball%1:04:00:: men---man%1:18:00:: agree , they 've never hit the heights---height%1:26:00:: .
Their heights---height%1:26:00:: , that is .
Mantle---person%1:03:00:: , the bull-necked blond switch-hitter---switch-hitter%1:18:00:: , had one sensational triple-crown season---triple-crown_season%1:28:00:: , 1959 , when he batted .365 and also led the American League---group%1:03:00:: in home runs---home_run%1:04:00:: , 52 , and RBIs---rbi%1:04:00:: , 130 .
Like the Yankees---group%1:03:00:: ' slugger---slugger%1:18:00:: , Mays---person%1:03:00:: , the terror---terror%1:18:01:: of the Giants---group%1:03:00:: , has had seasons---season%1:28:02:: that would be considered the ultimate by most players---player%1:18:01:: , but not by - or for - Willie---person%1:03:00:: .
His best years---year%1:28:01:: were 1954 when he hit .345 with 41 homers---homer%1:04:00:: and '55 when he belted 51 home runs---home_run%1:04:00:: , drove in 127 and stole 24 bases---base%1:06:02:: .
Now , apparently happier under new managers---manager%1:18:01:: , Mays---person%1:03:00:: and Mantle---person%1:03:00:: , the perfect players---player%1:18:01:: , are behaving as though they 're going to pass those previous peaks---peak%1:28:00:: .
Yes , we know , they 're professionals---professional%1:18:02:: , men---man%1:18:00:: paid to play , and they should n't care how they 're handled , just as long as their names---name%1:10:00:: are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month .
The truth---truth%1:09:00:: is , though , that men---man%1:18:00:: react differently to different treatment---treatment%1:04:01:: .
For that matter , Stan Musial---person%1:03:00:: is rare , possessing the disposition---disposition%1:07:00:: that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers---manager%1:18:01:: , reserving his opinions---opinion%1:09:00:: , but not his effort---effort%1:04:01:: .
Mantle---person%1:03:00:: , it 's apparent , resented Casey Stengel---person%1:03:00:: 's attempts---attempt%1:04:00:: to push and prod him into the perfection---perfection%1:26:00:: the veteran manager---manager%1:18:01:: saw as a thrilling possibility---possibility%1:09:03:: .
The old man---old_man%1:18:02:: was almost too possessive .
Stengel---person%1:03:00:: inherited DiMaggio---person%1:03:00:: , Rizzuto---person%1:03:00:: , but he brought up Mantle---person%1:03:00:: from Class---class%1:14:05:: C to the majors---majors%1:14:00:: , from Joplin---location%1:03:00:: to New York---location%1:03:00:: .
With the speed---speed%1:28:00:: and power---power%1:19:00:: of the body---body%1:08:00:: beautiful he saw before him , Ol ' Case---person%1:03:00:: wanted No.---no.%1:23:00:: 7---7%1:23:00:: to be not only the best homerun---home_run%1:04:00:: hitter---hitter%1:18:00:: , but also the best bunter---bunter%1:18:00:: , base-runner---base_runner%1:18:00:: and outfielder---outfielder%1:18:00:: .
Stengel---person%1:03:00:: probably preached too much in the early days---day%1:28:03:: when the kid---kid%1:18:00:: wanted to pop his bubble gum---bubble_gum%1:13:00:: and sow his oats .
Inheriting a more mature Mantle---person%1:03:00:: , who now has seen the sights---sight%1:10:00:: on and off Broadway---location%1:03:00:: , Ralph Houk---person%1:03:00:: quietly bestowed , no pun---pun%1:10:00:: intended , the mantle---mantle%1:10:00:: of authority---authority%1:18:00:: on Mickey---person%1:03:00:: .
The Major---person%1:03:00:: decided that , rather than be led , the slugger---slugger%1:18:00:: could lead .
And what leadership---leadership%1:04:00:: a proud Mantle---person%1:03:00:: has given so far .
The opinion---opinion%1:10:01:: continues here that with a 162 - game---game%1:04:00:: schedule---schedule%1:10:00:: , pitching---pitching%1:04:00:: spread thin through a 10 - team---team%1:14:00:: league---league%1:14:01:: and a most inviting target---target%1:10:00:: in Los Angeles---los_angeles%1:15:00:: ' Wrigley Field Jr.---location%1:03:00:: , Mantle---person%1:03:00:: just might break the most glamorous record---record%1:04:00:: on the books---book%1:10:02:: , Babe Ruth---person%1:03:00:: 's 60 homers---homer%1:04:00:: of 1927 .
Mays---person%1:03:00:: ' day---day%1:28:01:: came a day---day%1:28:00:: earlier for Willie---person%1:03:00:: than for the kids---kid%1:18:00:: and Commies---commie%1:18:00:: this year---year%1:28:01:: .
Willie---person%1:03:00:: 's wonderful walloping Sunday---sunday%1:28:00:: - four home runs---home_run%1:04:00:: - served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark---person%1:03:00:: .
Next to Leo Durocher---person%1:03:00:: , Dark---person%1:03:00:: taught Mays---person%1:03:00:: the most when he was a grass---grass%1:20:00:: green rookie---rookie%1:18:00:: rushed up to the Polo Grounds---location%1:03:00:: 10 years---year%1:28:01:: ago this month---month%1:28:01:: , to help the Giants---group%1:03:00:: win a dramatic pennant---pennant%1:10:01:: .
